   00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.720    - Thank you, President Garber        2    00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.720    and thank you, former President Gay        3    00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.719    who called me last year    to extend this offer.        4    00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.886    (audience applauding)        5    00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:26.580    It's an incredible honor        6    00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.457    to address the distinguished    Harvard faculty,        7    00:00:30.457 --> 00:00:33.723    the mysterious Harvard Corporation,        8    00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.840    and the loving friends and family        9    00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.840    who have traveled far and close    to be here with you today.        10    00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.830    But wait, most of all, despite everything,        11    00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.360    because you worked really hard,        12    00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.210    I am so thrilled to congratulate        13    00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.040    the battle-tested graduates    of the class of 2024.        14    00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:04.594    Thank you.        15    00:01:04.594 --> 00:01:07.761    (audience applauding)        16    00:01:13.902 --> 00:01:18.210    This was a harder speech to    write than the Nobel lecture,        17    00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.860    you know, because since 2021,        18    00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.490    the world has gotten so much worse.        19    00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.350    We live in a dystopian    science fiction world        20    00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.963    where everything can change    in the blink of an eye        21    00:01:34.963 --> 00:01:37.890    when you have been forced        22    00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.180    to turn crisis into opportunity.        23    00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.830    No one knows this better    than the class of 2024.        24    00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.420    A pandemic meant no    high school graduation.        25    00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.830    Your first year here in    lockdown, wearing masks,        26    00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.170    afraid of contact,        27    00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.900    you laid out all of the problems,        28    00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.693    the existential problems we face today.        29    00:02:04.752 --> 00:02:08.280    We were pushed online in the virtual world        30    00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.500    and that made things worse        31    00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.110    because the accelerant to conflict        32    00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.590    and violence to us against them,        33    00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.051    to wars that have killed tens of thousands        34    00:02:20.051 --> 00:02:24.483    sparking historic campus protests,        35    00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.683    that accelerant is technology.        36    00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.560    It turned what once used        37    00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.560    to be our civilized Harvard    thinking slow public discussions        38    00:02:38.653 --> 00:02:42.663    into what's become a    gladiator's battle to the death.        39    00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.930    I know this firsthand.        40    00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.650    The Philippines, America's former colony,        41    00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.650    110 million people was    social media's Petri dish.        42    00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.580    For a crucial six years,        43    00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.730    Filipinos spent the most time online        44    00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.240    and on social media globally,        45    00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.280    and we became the testing ground        46    00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.470    for these American tech companies.        47    00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.700    Their platform's designs    exploited by power and money        48    00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.980    in information warfare.        49    00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.833    It became worse when    TikTok joined the fray.        50    00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.271    If the tactics worked on us,        51    00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:23.733    it was deployed for you.        52    00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.930    That's what happened in 2016    when 126 million Americans        53    00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.760    were targeted by Russian disinformation,        54    00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.200    and on January 6th in the    violence on Capitol Hill,        55    00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.653    when Silicon Valley    sins came home to roost.        56    00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.660    Because I accepted your    invitation to be here today,        57    00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.400    I was attacked online        58    00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.337    and called antisemitic by power and money        59    00:03:52.337 --> 00:03:56.910    because they want power and money.        60    00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.420    While the other side    was already attacking me        61    00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.183    because I had been on    stage with Hillary Clinton.        62    00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.180    Hard to win, right?        63    00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.660    But I'd already survived    information operations        64    00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.130    from my own government.        65    00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.880    Free speech used to pound you to silence,        66    00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.290    90 hate messages per hour in 2016.        67    00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.330    That was eight years ago,        68    00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.640    fed me death threats for breakfast.        69    00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.120    They attacked the way I    looked, the way I sound,        70    00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.433    they dehumanized me.        71    00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.160    But, you know, the funniest thing,        72    00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.474    because when you're the    target, you just have to laugh,        73    00:04:35.474 --> 00:04:39.933    is that I was supposedly    both CIA and communist.        74    00:04:41.544 --> 00:04:43.800    None of these were true.        75    00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.750    But the end goal, please    know this, is chaos.        76    00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.990    Break down trust.        77    00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.990    If you don't have the right    information, you can't act.        78    00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.010    That's partly the reason why journalists        79    00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.690    are on the front lines.        80    00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.770    The Meta narrative,        81    00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.890    disinformation network seeded against us,        82    00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.913    and this is globally, was    journalist equals criminal.        83    00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.842    Then the bottom up attacks    in the Philippines against us        84    00:05:12.842 --> 00:05:14.940    began on social media.        85    00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.771    That was followed a year later        86    00:05:16.771 --> 00:05:19.781    by the weaponization of the law.        87    00:05:19.781 --> 00:05:24.120    In 2019, I was arrested    twice in about a month,        88    00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.040    posted bail eight times.        89    00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.180    In about three months,        90    00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.152    I thought I was gonna have    to do a workflow for arrests.        91    00:05:30.152 --> 00:05:34.590    But before it all ended,    I had 10 arrest warrants.        92    00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.700    Rappler and I paid more in bail and bonds        93    00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.680    than our dictator's wife, Imelda Marcos,        94    00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.453    you remember her shoes?        95    00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.320    She was convicted for corruption.        96    00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.460    But I did nothing wrong    except to do my job,        97    00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.460    to report the facts, to    hold power to account.        98    00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.860    For this I had to be okay        99    00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.680    with spending the rest of my life in jail.        100    00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.513    At one point,        101    00:06:02.513 --> 00:06:05.430    it was more than a century    in jail that I faced.        102    00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.740    To be here today,        103    00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.940    I had to ask for permission        104    00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.493    to travel from our Supreme Court.        105    00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.733    Anyone else out here on bail?        106    00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:18.693    Just me?        107    00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:22.470    (audience laughing)        108    00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.750    It taught me a valuable lesson.        109    00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.750    (audience cheering)        110    00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.990    I loved the speeches    of the students today.        111    00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.752    They were incredible because-        112    00:06:42.752 --> 00:06:45.919    (audience applauding)        113    00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.940    These times will hopefully teach you        114    00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.223    the same lesson I learned.        115    00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.890    You don't know who you    are until you're tested,        116    00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.280    until you fight for what you believe in.        117    00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.043    Because that defines who you are.        118    00:07:06.585 --> 00:07:10.833    But you're Harvard, you    better get your facts right,        119    00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.993    because now you are being tested.        120    00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.530    The chilling effect means        121    00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.500    that many are choosing to stay silent        122    00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.220    because there are    consequences to speaking out.        123    00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.860    I'm shocked at the fear and anger,        124    00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.960    the paranoia splitting open        125    00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.853    the major fracture lines of society,        126    00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:36.787    the inability to listen.        127    00:07:36.787 --> 00:07:40.653    What happened to us in the    Philippines, it's here.        128    00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.843    The campus protests are    testing everyone in America.        129    00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.440    Protests are healthy.        130    00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.080    They shouldn't be violent.        131    00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.080    Protests give voice, they    shouldn't be silenced.        132    00:07:57.678 --> 00:08:01.928    (audience cheering and applauding)        133    00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:11.090    But you live in complicated, complex times        134    00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.560    where I think administrators        135    00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.420    and students also faced    an unacknowledged danger:        136    00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:23.100    technology, making    everything faster, meaner,        137    00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:28.100    more polarized with insidious    information operations online        138    00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.430    that are dividing generations.        139    00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:34.710    Rappler will be documenting this        140    00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.250    and publishing in the    next couple of weeks.        141    00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.943    Maybe Rappler's experience can help you.        142    00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.790    After all, we were in hell    and now we're in purgatory,        143    00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.290    right?        144    00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.350    It can get better.        145    00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.650    And here are three ways    we've learned, right?        146    00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:00.300    One, choose your best self.        147    00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.623    Two, turn crisis into opportunity.        148    00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.870    And three, it's wonderful to    have heard this several times        149    00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.580    from the stage today,        150    00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.003    three, be vulnerable.        151    00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.960    One, choose your best self,        152    00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.140    set and stay focused on your goals,        153    00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.543    but know the values you live by.        154    00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.720    How important is power?        155    00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.380    How much money will make you happy?        156    00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.760    Because the only thing you can    control in the world is you.        157    00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.030    Too often we let ourselves off the hook,        158    00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:44.030    refusing to look at our own    difficult or ugly truths.        159    00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.833    We rationalize bad behavior.        160    00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:52.290    Remember that character    is created in the sum        161    00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.710    of all the little choices we make.        162    00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.890    If you're not clear about your values,        163    00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.240    you may wake up one day        164    00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.293    and realize you don't like    the person you've become.        165    00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.223    So choose your best self.        166    00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.780    You're standing on the    rubble of the world that was,        167    00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.040    recognize it.        168    00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.990    I said this in the Nobel lecture,        169    00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:23.010    an atom bomb exploded in    our information ecosystem        170    00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.100    because social media turned    our world upside down,        171    00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.150    spreading lies faster than facts,        172    00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.750    while amplifying fear and anger,        173    00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:38.733    fueling hatred by design for profit.        174    00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.781    Whether it's the AI of social    media or Generative AI,        175    00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:46.650    we don't have integrity of information.        176    00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.980    We don't have integrity of facts.        177    00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.670    And here's three sentences    I've said over and over.        178    00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.640    Without facts, you can't have truth.        179    00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.700    Without truth, you can't have trust.        180    00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.180    Without these three, we    have no shared reality,        181    00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.170    no rule of law, no democracy.        182    00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.930    We can't begin to solve    existential problems        183    00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.343    like climate change.        184    00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.800    This outrage economy built on our data,        185    00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.615    microtargeting us, transformed our world,        186    00:11:20.615 --> 00:11:24.213    rewarding the worst of humanity.        187    00:11:25.075 --> 00:11:29.810    Online violence is real-world violence.        188    00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.430    And as you've pointed out,        189    00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:37.080    people are dying from genocide in Myanmar,        190    00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.730    fueled by Facebook according    to the UN and Meta itself,        191    00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:46.730    to Ukraine, Sudan, Haiti, Armenia, Gaza.        192    00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.000    (audience cheering)        193    00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.353    The challenge,        194    00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.620    the challenge today        195    00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.860    is whether our international    rules-based order        196    00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.620    still works, does it?        197    00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:09.570    The challenge is justice    core to our humanity.        198    00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.660    Too many powerful people are getting away        199    00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.800    with impunity from countries to companies.        200    00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.140    And it is dividing us in ways        201    00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.470    that are literally destroying us,        202    00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:26.463    destroying democracy, destroying trust.        203    00:12:27.946 --> 00:12:29.910    In Cambridge Commons,        204    00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.610    just on the other side of that gate,        205    00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.490    there's a marker to American    patriot William Dawes,        206    00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.880    who like his more famous    friend Paul Revere,        207    00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.307    rode through here sounding the alarm,        208    00:12:42.307 --> 00:12:44.097    ""The British are coming!""        209    00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.520    Well, today's equivalent,        210    00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.620    an alarm that's made me feel        211    00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.046    like Cassandra and Sisyphus combined        212    00:12:52.046 --> 00:12:55.650    because I feel like I've    been shouting since 2016        213    00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:59.340    when I watched our    institutions crumble quickly        214    00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.690    in the Philippines.        215    00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:05.013    And I will say it now,    the fascists are coming.        216    00:13:07.182 --> 00:13:10.349    (audience applauding)        217    00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:19.080    In 2023, the Global Democracy Index        218    00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.900    fell to its lowest level ever.        219    00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:26.900    Today, 71% of the world    lives under autocratic rule.        220    00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:31.680    We are electing illiberal    leaders democratically,        221    00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.484    and once in power,        222    00:13:33.484 --> 00:13:37.770    these autocrats not    only crush institutions        223    00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.420    in their countries,        224    00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.803    but they form alliances and    create Kleptocracy, Inc.        225    00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.130    This is your challenge.        226    00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.173    It is our challenge.        227    00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.533    And Harvard played a    role in getting us here.        228    00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:57.750    Seven years ago, Mark    Zuckerberg stood at this podium,        229    00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.230    finally got his degree        230    00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.960    and said that his life's purpose        231    00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.277    was to connect the whole world,        232    00:14:06.277 --> 00:14:10.200    ""Move fast, break things,"" Facebook said.        233    00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.763    Well, it broke democracy.        234    00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.537    In my book, ""How to    Stand up to a Dictator,""        235    00:14:16.404 --> 00:14:17.880    we were fighting too.        236    00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.050    I named two, not just Rodrigo    Duterte in the Philippines,        237    00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.260    he's one man who crushed institutions,        238    00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:29.040    but even more powerful was Mark Zuckerberg        239    00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:34.040    because he, along with tech    bros, are controlling the world.        240    00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.070    Okay, I will shut up.        241    00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.380    Enough, right?        242    00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.609    Because let me bring it to you,        243    00:14:42.609 --> 00:14:47.609    the battle to regain trust    begins now with all of you.        244    00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.480    Harvard says it educates the    future leaders of the world.        245    00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.098    Well, if you future leaders        246    00:14:57.098 --> 00:15:01.200    don't fight for democracy right now,        247    00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.683    there will be little left for you to lead.        248    00:15:06.115 --> 00:15:09.282    (audience applauding)        249    00:15:18.267 --> 00:15:19.890    How do you do this?        250    00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:24.333    And this leads to two, turn    crisis into opportunity.        251    00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:27.780    I think you've lived through this.        252    00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:32.430    Accept that crisis is here to stay.        253    00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.130    In Rappler, my co-founders,        254    00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:37.390    and one of them is here, Glenda Gloria,        255    00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.908    who's a Neiman Fellow from 2018.        256    00:15:40.908 --> 00:15:43.890    (audience cheering)        257    00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:48.890    We learned to embrace the worst    scenarios we could imagine.        258    00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.521    And this happened during    our darkest times.        259    00:15:51.521 --> 00:15:55.830    Then we workflowed what    our company would do.        260    00:15:55.830 --> 00:16:00.830    We drilled our team and    we prepared for the worst.        261    00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:05.990    We also learned strangely    to become punching bags        262    00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:10.890    because we didn't want to    tear down our judiciary.        263    00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.560    We didn't want to tear    down our government.        264    00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:18.560    We knew how potent fear is    and we tried to step in,        265    00:16:19.918 --> 00:16:24.693    I mean, at some point you get    angry when silence is consent.        266    00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.753    But you understand.        267    00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.050    Well, I did have good news.        268    00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:35.475    Remember, we put out all of    our worst case scenarios.        269    00:16:35.475 --> 00:16:37.541    And the reality we lived through        270    00:16:37.541 --> 00:16:40.923    was so much better than    we could have imagined.        271    00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:45.000    Hell, purgatory, right?        272    00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.550    It didn't mean we weren't afraid.        273    00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:51.090    We just made a pact among the    four co-founders of Rappler        274    00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.460    that only one of us could be afraid        275    00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.963    at any single time.        276    00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:57.633    We rotated the fear.        277    00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.950    But now, for you, for us,        278    00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:04.020    the corruption of our    information ecosystem        279    00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.540    is about to get worse.        280    00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.316    Because of deep fakes,        281    00:17:08.316 --> 00:17:11.880    you can't trust your eyes and ears.        282    00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.330    Because of chat bots, you    can't trust that the person        283    00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:18.630    you're communicating with is even human.        284    00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.820    After Elon Musk bought Twitter,        285    00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:23.550    he fired its trust and safety teams,        286    00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:26.520    Meta and Google also    cut some of their staff.        287    00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.540    So as half the world goes to the polls,        288    00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.630    goes to vote this year,        289    00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:38.603    there will be fewer safety    measures in place to protect us.        290    00:17:38.603 --> 00:17:43.020    Now big tech is choking    traffic to new sites,        291    00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:47.372    which means you will get    less news in your feeds.        292    00:17:47.372 --> 00:17:50.790    How do you know what's real?        293    00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.490    How do you know what's fact        294    00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:57.510    when your emotions are what's manipulated?        295    00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.210    When our biology is hacked?        296    00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:03.033    Instead of the facts,    the enshittification,        297    00:18:04.001 --> 00:18:09.001    enshittification of the    internet is in full bloom,        298    00:18:09.212 --> 00:18:13.080    more trash, more propaganda,        299    00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.910    more information operations    that push our emotional buttons.        300    00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.880    Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo    deleted X last year        301    00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.277    calling it ""a human sewer.""        302    00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.920    We will have to struggle harder        303    00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.790    for agency, for independent thought.        304    00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.530    And it's not just the tech companies        305    00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.162    that abdicated responsibility    for protecting us,        306    00:18:37.162 --> 00:18:41.349    it's also democratic governments    like the United States,        307    00:18:41.349 --> 00:18:46.349    tech is the least regulated    industry around the world.        308    00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:50.454    That's why the US needs to    reform or revoke Section 230        309    00:18:50.454 --> 00:18:54.220    of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.        310    00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.387    (audience applauding)        311    00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:05.103    We need to stop the impunity.        312    00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:10.650    We also need to acknowledge    our crisis of faith.        313    00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.813    I've always believed in the    goodness of human nature,        314    00:19:13.813 --> 00:19:18.813    but that has never been    tested as much as it is today,        315    00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:23.490    when the incentive    structure of the technology        316    00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:27.600    that connects us rewards the bad,        317    00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.648    eliminates the best of who we can be.        318    00:19:31.648 --> 00:19:35.580    So we need to restore    our faith in humanity,        319    00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.193    and that starts with compassion.        320    00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:42.600    There's a word that goes    beyond empathy in South Africa.        321    00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.123    I love this word, ubuntu.        322    00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:50.460    I am because we are.        323    00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.370    It's a deeper faith in another person.        324    00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:57.780    It's deeper than stepping    in someone else's shoes.        325    00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.906    But in order to get    there, to get to ubuntu,        326    00:20:00.906 --> 00:20:03.930    we have to lower our shields,        327    00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.593    which leads us to three, be vulnerable.        328    00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.360    You've accomplished a    lot to be here today.        329    00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.810    You might think being vulnerable is weak        330    00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:18.480    and it is hard to trust.        331    00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.100    But in every relationship,    in every negotiation,        332    00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.080    in order to move forward        333    00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.282    and accomplish anything meaningful,        334    00:20:28.282 --> 00:20:32.880    someone lowers their shield first,        335    00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.100    brings down their ego,        336    00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:40.063    the defense mechanism, then others follow.        337    00:20:40.063 --> 00:20:43.053    Let that person be you.        338    00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.950    Because when you are vulnerable,        339    00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:50.250    you create the strongest bonds.        340    00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.870    You restore trust        341    00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:55.260    and the ability to find creative solutions        342    00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.990    to intractable problems.        343    00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.240    You become resilient        344    00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:05.100    and enable the most    inspiring possibilities.        345    00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.250    So choose your best self.        346    00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.838    Turn crisis into opportunity.        347    00:21:10.838 --> 00:21:12.663    Be vulnerable.        348    00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.540    This is it.        349    00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.360    This time matters.        350    00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.663    What you do matters.        351    00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:27.950    The war isn't just happening    in Gaza, in Sudan, in Ukraine.        352    00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.631    It isn't just out there.        353    00:21:31.631 --> 00:21:33.153    It's in your pocket.        354    00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.460    Each of us is fighting    our own battles for facts,        355    00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.570    for integrity,        356    00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.430    because the dictator to-be        357    00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:45.213    can zoom in and target each of us.        358    00:21:45.213 --> 00:21:48.169    So let me end by reminding you        359    00:21:48.169 --> 00:21:53.160    we're standing on the rubble    of the world that was,        360    00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:57.600    and we, you must have the courage,        361    00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.415    the foresight to imagine        362    00:22:00.415 --> 00:22:04.740    and create the world as it should be.        363    00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:09.740    More compassionate, more    equal, more sustainable.        364    00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:14.670    Your Harvard education    gives you the tools.        365    00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:19.570    Make it a world that is safe    from fascists and tyrants.        366    00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:25.322    Alone, no matter how much    of a superstar you are,        367    00:22:25.322 --> 00:22:28.620    you will accomplish very little.        368    00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:32.103    We will accomplish very little alone.        369    00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:36.450    This is about what we can do together        370    00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.663    to find what binds us together.        371    00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.763    Our world on fire needs you.        372    00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:50.283    So class of 2024,        373    00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.213

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.120    today we are celebrated for what we        7    00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.160    know in fact for most most of our Lives        8    00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.280    we've learned to feel a sense of        9    00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.840    accomplishment in the awards accolades        10    00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.479    and Honors that line our childhood

counterintuitive that I've learned from        17    00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.960    the class of 2024        18    00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.079    the power of not        19    00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.079    knowing I grew up in the Great Plains of        20    00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.560    Nebraska alongside cattle ranches and        21    00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.399    corn

first in my family        25    00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.890    to attend college here in the US        26    00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.840    [Applause]        27    00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.280    there was a lot I didn't know when it        28    00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.720    came time I asked my parents how to        29    00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.560    apply to colleges and they too said I        30    00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.040    don't        31    00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.959    know the words I don't know used to make        32    00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.040    me feel        33    00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.640    powerless like there was no answer and        34    00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.360    therefore no        35    00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.400    way as if I was admitting        36    00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.040    defeat from Nebraska to Harvard I found        37    00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.959    myself redefining this feeling of not        38    00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.640    knowing I discovered a newfound power in        39    00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.360    how much I didn't        40    00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.959    know I didn't know a field called The        41    00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.959    History of Science even existed and I        42    00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.000    now find myself a graduate of the        43    00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.800    department here for the first time in my        44    00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.440    life I had a professor of color a        45    00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.239    historian iian of science who taught me        46    00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.480    history is just as much about the        47    00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.319    stories we don't know as the stories we        48    00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.519    do in the history of science we often        49    00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.480    look for what is missing what documents        50    00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.920    are not in the        51    00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.519    archives and whose voices are not        52    00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.280    captured in        53    00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.040    history I've        54    00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.280    learned silence is rarely        55    00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.760    empty often loud        56    00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.959    I've learned this not only in the        57    00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.840    classroom but also from the class of        58    00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.319    2024 in reflecting on our Collective        59    00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.959    moments at Harvard I've realized it's        60    00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.680    the moments of uncertainty from which        61    00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.480    something greater than we could have        62    00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.879    ever imagined        63    00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.840    grows and our class has experienced more        64    00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.599    than our fair share of the        65    00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.079    unknown in our first year during covid        66

unrest across        144    00:09:35.959 --> 00:09:40.399    campus but it's now in a moment like        145    00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:43.760    this that the power of not knowing        146    00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.120    becomes        147    00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.640    critical maybe we don't know what it's        148    00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.519    like to be ethnically        149    00:09:52.519 --> 00:09:55.800    targeted maybe we don't know what it's        150    00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.959    like to come face to face with violence        151    00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:01.320    and death        152    00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.760    but we don't have to        153    00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.800    know        154    00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.680    solidarity is not dependent on what we        155    00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:16.920    know because not knowing is an ethical        156    00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:23.879    [Applause]        157    00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.240    stance it creates space for empathy        158    00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.399    humility and a willingness to        159    00:10:35.399 --> 00:10:39.440    learn I choose to say I don't know so        160    00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.160    I'm empowered to        161    00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.399    ask to        162    00:10:43.399 --> 00:10:46.279    listen I believe an important type of        163    00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:49.040    learning takes place especially in        164    00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.399    moments of uncertainty when we lean into        165    00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:54.800    conversations without assuming we have        166    00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.660    all the answers        167    00:10:56.660 -->

in people we don't        171    00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.720    know can we feel the        172    00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.200    pain of people with whom we        173    00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.160    disagree as we        174    00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.360    graduate what we know our material        175    00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.079    knowledge may not matter so much        176    00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:35.760    anymore the truth is it's what we don't        177    00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.160    know and how we navigate it that will        178    00:11:39.160 -->

uncomfortable but I encourage you to        182    00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.959    dive into the deep end of discomfort        183    00:11:51.959 --> 00:11:55.720    engage with the nuances

thank you.        21    00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:28.661    I do not, thank you.        22    00:01:30.535 --> 00:01:32.035    I don't know much about Latin.        23    00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.370    I have no real passion for enzymes        24    00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.810    and public global policy    is something I scan        25    00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.323    in the newspaper just    before I do the wordle,        26    00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.613    and yet here I am closing.        27    00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:56.043    Closing for Josiah, Pallas, and Vic.        28    00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:57.873    Thank you guys.        29    00:01:58.842 --> 00:02:01.320    (people clapping)        30    00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.320    Some of us here can recite    by repetition the preamble        31    00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.970    to a television show we might    have seen five days a week        32    00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.300    about a strange being from another planet        33    00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.680    with powers and abilities far    beyond those of mortal men,        34    00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.680    Superman, who disguised as    a mild mannered reporter        35    00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.150    for a great metropolitan newspaper,        36    00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.510    there were many metropolitan    newspapers once,        37    00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.983    and some of them were great,        38    00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.380    who could change the course        39    00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.040    of mighty rivers and bend    steel with his bare hands.        40    00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.110    He was faster than a speeding bullet        41    00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.150    and he was more powerful than a locomotive        42    00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.210    and he was able to leap tall    buildings at a single bound        43    00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.630    and those are very, very    impressive superpowers.        44    00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.900    No, well, what was most impressive        45    00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.310    about his powers was how    he chose to wield them.        46    00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.143    Yeah, yeah, yeah.        47    00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:59.313    Cats were saved from trees,        48    00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:02.370    evil doers were banished        49    00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.820    to the phantom zone and    the innocent were rescued        50    00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.220    with reliable and assuring regularity.        51    00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.800    But in those half hours,    which have since grown        52    00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.560    to many full length films and multiverses        53    00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.543    and God, you kids see them all,        54    00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.910    was the ongoing struggle        55    00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.310    for not just the protection    and safety of the world,        56    00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.460    but to the exposing of crooks        57    00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.070    and their lies to the light of day.        58    00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.670    Superman, you see, and his    proxies of Wonder Woman        59    00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.161    and Captain America and Black    Panther and the Black Widow        60    00:03:34.161 --> 00:03:37.061    and the Fantastic Four, my    God, there's a million of them.        61    00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.580    They are all enmeshed in    that never ending battle        62    00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.640    for truth, justice and the American Way        63    00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.330    and in such a struggle    being a Superman is a plus,        64    00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.050    even with his one lethal weakness exposure        65    00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.250    to chunks of the wreckage        66    00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.690    of his home planet destroyed    by its own hubris and apathy.        67    00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.360    But hey, there ain't no Superman        68    00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.210    nor anyone else in his Justice League.        69    00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.510    There's just us on this planet.        70    00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.880    Now, on occasions such as this,        71    00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.000    beware of certain orders        72    00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.640    who resort to using sage    quotations from historical figures        73    00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.320    or the words of legends of literature        74    00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.110    and arts or the name    dropping of famous friends,        75    00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.490    as a claim to some kind of    wisdom or super ability.        76    00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.290    Some people standing        77    00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.680    at this podium shouldn't    be considered much more        78    00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.250    than lucky sots who are in the    right place at the right time        79    00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.450    with the right goods    and the right attitude        80    00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:42.453    or as a man named Marlon    Brando once said to me,        81    00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.860    Vic, would you pick up    that name I just dropped.        82    00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.200    Marlon Brando, would you    hold onto it till we're done?        83    00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.033    Thank you.        84    00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:53.866    Give it back to me at the end.        85    00:04:53.866 --> 00:04:55.173    I'm gonna need it back.        86    00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.390    Yes, as a man named    Marlon Brando once said        87    00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.740    to me on a message        88    00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.443    he left in my telephone answering machine,        89    00:05:05.437 --> 00:05:07.383    ""Tommy, Tommy Hankerchief.        90    00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.970    This is Marlon Branflakes calling    you to ask where you are.""        91    00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.530    Then later, he told me        92    00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.530    that when he was a young man    and registered for the draft,        93    00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.170    he filled out the form    for his name and age,        94    00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.223    but when it came to his    race, he wrote human.        95    00:05:31.447 --> 00:05:34.890    ""For Tommy, Tommy, what are we,        96    00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.920    all, but human?        97    00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.830    Yeah, we are all, but human        98    00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.240    Now as an armchair historian        99    00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.013    who reads non-fiction for pleasure,        100    00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.840    the books divine        101    00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.220    that there has never    been a graduating class        102    00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.963    that has not faced the greatest    challenges of all time.        103    00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.650    That come every spring        104    00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.260    the maelstrom of history swirl so wildly        105    00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.250    that no matter the year or    the era or the generation,        106    00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.010    there is always an atmospheric river        107    00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.120    of events that makes right now        108    00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.203    the hinge upon which our fate is turning.        109    00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.020    And we here in the stands look        110    00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.277    at you all in the caps    and the gowns and we hope,        111    00:06:24.277 --> 00:06:27.057    ""Oh, at last, help is on the way.""        112    00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.970    Somewhere matriculating today        113    00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.050    is a man of iron,        114    00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.940    a woman of steel        115    00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.600    a superhuman just in the nick of time.        116    00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.060    Now this is not because we have failed        117    00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.910    in our duties or are completely spent.        118    00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.910    We have done some very super    things over our generations.        119    00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:56.210    It's because we are all in a cage match,        120    00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.030    mixed martial arts battle royale        121    00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.270    with agents of hubris, apathy,        122    00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:07.080    intolerance, and braying incompetence,        123    00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.440    the malevolent equals to    imperial storm troopers,        124    00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.693    Lex Luthor and Loki,        125    00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.553    and we could all use    a superhero right now.        126    00:07:18.546 --> 00:07:21.703    (people clapping)        127    00:07:21.703 --> 00:07:26.370    Now looking out at the flowing    colors of Harvard yard,        128    00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.773    the goofy big hands that clap,        129    00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.823    the balls that represent    the world on which we live,        130    00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.770    the streamers in the    piatas and someone's very        131    00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.190    big face rendered large out there amongst.        132    00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.030    There she is.        133    00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.290    That's it.        134    00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.123    That's it.        135    00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.730    We see beings who are young        136    00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.910    and restless with energy and imagination,        137    00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:58.650    with righteousness and    enlightenment and joy and compassion        138    00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.080    and we celebrate your proclaimed wisdom        139    00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.150    and your work ethic.        140    00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:08.010    We know no one is faster    than a speeding bullet.        141    00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:12.033    To our shame, every day, to our shame.        142    00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.960    But we can still summon    more power than a locomotive        143    00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.820    and we are able to leap tall    buildings at a single bound,        144    00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.310    if we have the right gizmo.        145    00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.840    We can change the course        146    00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.530    of mighty rivers if such    a thing should be done        147    00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:31.530    and we make machines    that bend steel as easily        148    00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:34.710    as using our bare hands and    we know that to each other,        149    00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.380    we often seem like strange beings        150    00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.870    from another planet in habits and tastes        151    00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.080    and languages with    holidays and foods we eat        152    00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.200    and names of the days of    the week, all varying.        153    00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.700    We all have special powers        154    00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.000    and abilities far beyond    the reach of other mortals.        155    00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.873    Some of us can repair a    screen door with ease.        156    00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.600    Some of us can take care    of a five year old kid        157    00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.143    and a toddler for 24 hours a    day and never stop loving them.        158    00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.460    Some of us make sense        159    00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.410    of physics and economics        160    00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.863    and global policy.        161    00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:24.720    Some of us survive somehow    on minimum earnings.        162    00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.610    Some of us graduate from colleges        163    00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.000    by years of lockdowns in Zooms.        164    00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.780    Now these achievements are all stellar,        165    00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.980    even though, yes, we are all but human.        166    00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.820    Still, we'd like to look up    in the sky and see not a bird,        167    00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.820    not a plane, but well, someone    who is young and strong        168    00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:52.430    and super who will fight the    never ending battle for truth,        169    00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.350    for justice and for the American way.        170    00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:59.103    Someone who will take on that work.        171    00:10:00.178 --> 00:10:01.841    (people clapping)        172    00:10:01.841 --> 00:10:03.091    Now, all right.        173    00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.033    Now, a kooky uncle once said to me,        174    00:10:10.237 --> 00:10:11.910    ""We should all stay in school as long        175    00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.890    as we can because the moment we graduate,        176    00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.587    we have to work every day    for the rest of our lives.""        177    00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.050    Now that uncle        178    00:10:21.374 --> 00:10:22.224    was a bit bitter,        179    00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.843    but he was not wrong.        180    00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.710    We all get to complain about the man        181    00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.240    and we all have debts we gotta pay        182    00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.890    and we're all entitled to    a day off to lay about.        183    00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.460    But the work that is    called for that we must do        184    00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.263    has no expiration date.        185    00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:48.520    It is the construction    of our more perfect union        186    00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.740    and that job will never ever be completed.        187    00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.530    It's one that requires rigorous attention,        188    00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.953    unfading wherewithal and all hands.        189    00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.280    The work is the keeping of the promises        190    00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.240    of our promised land,    the practice of decency,        191    00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.620    the protection of freedom        192    00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.620    and the promotion of liberty    for all with no exceptions.        193    00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.243    And man, that takes on a lot of work.        194    00:11:17.048 --> 00:11:17.881    (people clapping)        195    00:11:17.881 --> 00:11:20.490    It's work that is done    on multiple job sites        196    00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:21.540    every single day        197    00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.940    and you can call each of    them the battle for truth,        198    00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.860    justice and the American way.        199    00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.083    Yes, the American way.        200    00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.740    The American way is    exampled in both plain sight        201    00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.043    and in subtle attitudes,        202    00:11:36.983 --> 00:11:40.110    in moments of routine exchange    and in broad expectations.        203    00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.930    It's in places of    historic weight and import        204    00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.330    and in the small spaces    in which we all stand,        205    00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.190    the American way could be exampled        206    00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.310    when you respect the law    and the rights of all?        207    00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.413    Because if you don't, who will?        208    00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.060    When your food is brought to    you, when you thank the server.        209    00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.520    Because if you don't, who will?        210    00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.437    When you pick up the litter        211    00:12:01.437 --> 00:12:02.610    that has missed the recycling bin?        212    00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:05.460    Because if you don't, who will?        213    00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.810    When you vote your conscience        214    00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:09.300    and make sure your neighbor    has the opportunity        215    00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.220    to do the same with theirs.        216    00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.455    Because if you don't, who will?        217    00:12:14.455 --> 00:12:17.288    (people clapping)        218    00:12:21.985 --> 00:12:24.600    When you make good on your victories        219    00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.650    and learn from your losses        220    00:12:27.871 --> 00:12:31.860    because both are the results    of proud and noble efforts.        221    00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.903    If you don't, who will?        222    00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.040    The American way was first    proposed not far from here        223    00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.440    when subjects of a king    demanded more control        224    00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.330    over their lives than that dictated        225    00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.260    by someone else's    definition of providence.        226    00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:51.240    At the same time, women    had no legal recourses.        227    00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.820    An entire segment of the    population had been taken        228    00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.400    from their homeland and slaved    to work as chattel regardless        229    00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.090    of their age and the original    inhabitants of this continent        230    00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:01.680    from sea to shining sea,        231    00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.820    the only ones who carried    the DNA of America,        232    00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.200    were considered subhuman.        233    00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.720    Yet even with such    paradox was written down        234    00:13:13.325 --> 00:13:16.140    the how to establish justice,        235    00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.700    ensure domestic tranquility,        236    00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.230    provide for the common defense,        237    00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.760    promote the general welfare        238    00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.940    and secure those blessings of liberty        239    00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.170    for ourselves and our posterity no matter,        240    00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.830    as time and conflict and the institutions        241    00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.560    of our democracy would determine,        242    00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.480    our gender, our race        243    00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.400    our creed, our color, our    chosen deities or who we love,        244    00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.400    for it is our manifest destiny    to pursue our own happiness.        245    00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:50.040    All of us, no exceptions, are entitled        246    00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.770    to the inalienable rights    of liberty and freedom        247    00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:57.770    because we live in the    United States of America.        248    00:13:58.315 --> 00:14:01.148    (people clapping)        249    00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.790    The vocabulary of the American way,        250    00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.830    of the law and the rights we share        251    00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.870    is some part philosophical, amusing,        252    00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.240    some part answering a    question with a question        253    00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.580    some part trying to bull us all over        254    00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.083    with your knowledge of Latin.        255    00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.790    Some part answering the    question with a question        256    00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:31.560    and the rest is all practical.        257    00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.290    It's even physical and    it's certainly tangible.        258    00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.653    It's the language of telling the truth.        259    00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.863    What is truth again in Latin?        260    00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.218    - [Speaker] Veritas.        261    00:14:43.218 --> 00:14:44.343    - Veritas.        262    00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.550    The language of telling the truth.        263    00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.350    It is in the vision quest        264    00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:53.700    for truth that we look to you    newly incorporated members        265    00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:58.620    of the Justice League of    Avengers to come to the rescue,        266    00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.170    for the truth to some    is no longer empirical.        267    00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.390    It's no longer based on data,        268    00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:07.320    nor common sense, nor even common decency.        269    00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.420    Telling the truth is    no longer the benchmark        270    00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.950    for public service.        271    00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:12.210    It's no longer the salve        272    00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:15.810    to our fears or the guide to our actions.        273    00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:20.490    Truth is now considered    malleable by opinion        274    00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:23.010    and by zero sum endgames,        275    00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.950    imagery is manufactured with audacity,        276    00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:29.970    with purpose to achieve the    primal task of marring the truth        277    00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:33.510    with mock logic to achieve        278    00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.970    with fake expertise,        279    00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:40.203    with false sincerity, with    phrases like I'm just saying,        280    00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:43.323    oh, well, I'm just asking.        281    00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.863    I'm just wondering.        282    00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:50.190    Now, literally you    cannot believe your eyes        283    00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:52.860    and your ears will help others lie to you.        284    00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.770    Someone will report the world    to you exactly as you wish        285    00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:57.900    it were full of alternative facts,        286    00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.380    of conjured narrative meant    to buttress the status quo        287    00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.391    and deny its offenses        288    00:16:03.391 --> 00:16:05.340    or rejig the rules and    muddy the playing field,        289    00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.670    depending on where one    is on the food chain        290    00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:09.993    and the moral spectrum.        291    00:16:11.646 --> 00:16:15.000    The American way can be demonstrated        292    00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.140    without ceasing as a perpetual prayer        293    00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:24.140    by every big shot in any    plain Jane or Joe Blow.        294    00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.110    Justice can be an everyday pursuit,        295    00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:31.890    case by case with both lightning speed        296    00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:35.310    and the slow inevitable effect of gravity.        297    00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.110    Truth though, oh,        298    00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:38.550    truth,        299    00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.250    truth feeds up in the high country,        300    00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.503    as elusive as serenity,        301    00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:45.383    yet as certain        302    00:16:45.383 --> 00:16:47.643    as the north star and the southern cross.        303    00:16:49.238 --> 00:16:53.280    Truth is mined at the intersections    of our chosen behaviors        304    00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.483    and our fixed habits in    our personal boundaries.        305    00:16:59.259 --> 00:17:03.703    Truth has synonyms such as    honesty, honor, transparency,        306    00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:07.706    and yet the common practice    of so many is to play fast        307    00:17:07.706 --> 00:17:11.190    and loose with those very words        308    00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.320    to create enemies,        309    00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:18.090    to claim victimhood, to    raise the mediocre into merit        310    00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:22.620    and to make cloudy a vista    that is actually crystal clear.        311    00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:26.070    Likewise, truth has opposites.        312    00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:26.903    Omission.        313    00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.000    You don't need to know that.        314    00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.833    Distraction.        315    00:17:30.833 --> 00:17:34.380    That's not the real story, this is.        316    00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.840    Opinion masquerading as clairvoyance,        317    00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.840    oh, here's what is gonna happen.        318    00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.973    And influence pedaling.        319    00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:44.463    A lot of people are saying.        320    00:17:46.897 --> 00:17:48.180    Truth too,        321    00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:52.113    has a nemesis equal to    any colored kryptonite.        322    00:17:53.688 --> 00:17:55.620    That, lack of feral    hound, is never too far        323    00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.620    off the path in the    weeds and in the shadows,        324    00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.590    lying in wait for the lethal opportunity        325    00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.570    to bring truth down        326    00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.630    and that beast is indifference,        327    00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:10.590    which will make moot all the    permanence found in truth.        328    00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.819    Indifference will rust away the promise        329    00:18:12.819 --> 00:18:15.281    of our promised land.        330    00:18:15.281 --> 00:18:18.510    Propaganda and boldface lies        331    00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:20.790    will erode over time.        332    00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:24.480    Idolatry and imagery    lose luster and effect,        333    00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.050    ignorance and intolerance can be replaced        334    00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.420    by experience in the wink of an eye        335    00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:35.420    but indifference will narrow    the vision of America's people        336    00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:40.713    and make dim the light of    Lady Liberty's symbolic torch.        337    00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.760    Indifference make citizens        338    00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.110    into indentured servants    held in labor by the despots        339    00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:53.520    and tyrants whose default    setting is cynicism,        340    00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:58.200    who outlaw dissent and    ban art and dialogue        341    00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.223    and books.        342    00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.240    Who grab power any way they can.        343    00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.930    Enabled by the subterfuge    of their co-conspirators,        344    00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.520    rewarding their rationale        345    00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.620    of the complicit and surging        346    00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.920    into the vacuum caused by the indifference        347    00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.510    of a people who have been    made weary by struggle,        348    00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:22.410    so weary that they lose    hope and are left to yearn        349    00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:27.410    to be saved by the fiction of superheroes.        350    00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.580    Every day, every year,        351    00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.850    and for every graduating class,        352    00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:35.010    there is a choice to be made.        353    00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:35.970    It's the same option        354    00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.540    for all grownups who    have to decide to be one        355    00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:44.540    of three types of Americans,    those who embrace liberty,        356    00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.850    and freedom for all,        357    00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:49.653    those who won't,        358    00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:52.803    or those who are indifferent.        359    00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.680    Only the first do the work        360    00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.330    of creating a more perfect    union and nation indivisible.        361    00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.493    The others get in the way.        362    00:20:03.701 --> 00:20:05.344    In the never ending battle,        363    00:20:05.344 --> 00:20:08.400    you have all officially    joined as of today,        364    00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.730    the difference is in how truly you believe        365    00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:17.430    and in how vociferously you promote        366    00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:22.430    and how tightly you hold to    the truth that is self-evident.        367    00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:28.130    That of course we are all    created equally, yet differently.        368    00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:34.170    And of course we are all in this together.        369    00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.270    If we do the work,        370    00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:40.740    justice and the American    way are within our grasp,        371    00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.520    no matter our gender, our faith,        372    00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.020    our station        373    00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.510    our heritage or genetic makeup,        374    00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:49.950    the shade and hue        375    00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:54.600    of our flesh or the continental    birthplace of our ancestors.        376    00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.980    Why is that truth so    hard for some to accept,        377    00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.023    much less respect?        378    00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.610    If you live in the    United States of America,        379    00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:09.483    the responsibility is yours, ours.        380    00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.023    The effort is optional,        381    00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:14.883    but the truth,        382    00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:17.853    the truth is sacred,        383    00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:22.590    unalterable, chiseled into the stone        384    00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.440    of the foundation of our republic.        385    00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.123    All of us are able,        386    00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.243    none of us are super.        387    00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.300    We are the Americans.        388    00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.540    Liberty and justice is for us all        389    00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.800    because yes, we have specific names        390    00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.900    and we have lived every year        391    00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.683    of our ages, but when it comes to race,        392    00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.883    we are all uniquely magnificently,        393    00:21:52.159 --> 00:21:53.373    simply human,        394    00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.080    or so said        395    00:21:57.271 --> 00:22:00.663    Marlon Brando to Tommy Tommy Hankerchief.        396    00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:06.600    May goodness and mercy    follow you all the days,        397    00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.060    all the days of your lives.        398    00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.440    Godspeed.        399    00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.765    Congratulations.        400    00:22:11.765 --> 00:22:14.598    (people clapping)        "

(audience members cheering)        25    00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.760    Together we would have    late night conversations        26    00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.640    and play truth or truth,        27    00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.430    learning about each other's aspirations        28    00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.223    and grilling each other    about romantic interests.        29    00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330    My perspectives on different    issues in the world        30    00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.420    have widened because of    these incredible people        31    00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.670    from all over the world.        32    00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.430    When you zoom into an enzyme,    you'll see that it has        33    00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.330    a unique structure that allows    it to perform its function.        34    00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.240    The different creases    and folds of an enzyme        35    00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.220    allow it to do what it does.        36    00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.580    For instance, a gap in an enzyme        37    00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.680    might be where molecule fits        38    00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.840    and an extending branch of an enzyme        39    00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.360    might be where it grabs a molecule.        40    00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.610    Each crease, each fold,    each loop, each bump        41    00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.913    makes an enzyme perform    really fascinating functions.        42    00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.480    Part of the enzyme structure is determined        43    00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.790    by the DNA that encodes it.        44    00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.970    Similarly, our individual characteristics        45    00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.840    are partly determined by    the families we come from.        46    00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.840    My family, my DNA has    indeed shaped my upbringing        47    00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.220    from teaching me that nothing is too small        48    00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.990    for me to be passionate about        49    00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.260    and that library cards    are the key to life.        50    00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.953    My family has formed a solid    foundation of who I am.        51    00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.050    However, an enzyme structure    is not only determined        52    00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.240    by the DNA that encodes it.        53    00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.310    Other enzymes in the cell        54    00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.990    as well as the surrounding environment        55    00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.433    helped shape the enzyme.        56    00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.090    From our first year to    now, we've been together        57    00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.363    through ups and downs, shaping each other.        58    00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.120    We've scrambled for boxes,    toilet paper, and mute buns.        59    00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.583    As the world was shutting down in 2020,        60    00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.880    we've lived through a pandemic        61    00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.370    that has reconstructed our perception        62    00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.473    of what education can be.        63    00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.790    We've comforted each other        64    00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.853    as we grieved the loss of loved ones.        65    00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.500    We've met inspirational    professors who help us grow        66    00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.310    and classmates who are    musicians, magicians,        67    00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.600    and mountaineers who never    fail to encourage us.        68    00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.780    For many of us, it was a    long journey to get here        69    00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.540    to be sitting here today in the theater,        70    00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.540    and today we will celebrate!

journey from Malaysia IPO Malaysia to        49    00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.239    the Academy Awards stage begin with my        50    00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.480    first love which was not acting but        51    00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.660    dance I knew at a very young age that my        52    00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.180    gift was to communicate through movement        53    00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.540    in my studies I found freedom in        54    00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.120    discipline and focus I trained        55    00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.580    tirelessly day and night drilling my        56    00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.940    body in every aspect of the craft more        57    00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.519    importantly I trained in my mind to be        58    00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.980    still to silence The Whispers of        59    00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.239    self-doubt        60    00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.599    dance was my safe place my inevitable        61    00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.959    future and my undeniable path so I        62    00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.000    enrolled in a ballet school in England        63    00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.760    and began living my dream        64    00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.440    unfortunately        65    00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.800    life had other plans I suffered a spinal        66    00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.440    injury and just like that I watched        67    00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.980    everything vanish Into Thin Air life as        68    00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.120    I knew it        69    00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.340    was over        70    00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.400    with my dreams of dance crushed I credit        71    00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.040    the principle of my school for giving me        72    00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.800    the encouragement that ultimately led me        73    00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.680    to a career Beyond My Imagination        74    00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.099    it was she who encouraged me to stay        75    00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.560    loose about my future        76    00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.040    when falling the tendency is to tighten        77    00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.500    up to brace for impact        78    00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.860    but in truth the safest thing one can do        79    00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.959    is remain calm even curious about the        80    00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.659    shifting world around you        81    00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.519    after graduating with a degree in        82    00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.519    creative arts I returned home more open        83    00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.000    to other possibilities outside the box        84    00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000    with this awareness came the freedom to        85    00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.120    make choices I might not have otherwise        86    00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.120    been able to this opened the door to        87    00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.420    doing a commercial in Hong Kong then to        88    00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.780    acting roles and the start of my life in        89    00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.980    film        90    00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.099    which leads me to my second piece        91    00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.699    of advice know your limits        92    00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.340    although understanding what you can do        93    00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.800    is essential understanding what you        94    00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.860    can't do is pretty important too this        95    00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.220    works on two levels both internally and        96    00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.800    externally internally knowing your        97    00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.740    limits keep you humble motivated and        98    00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.259    focused on a goal to point your finger        99    00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:40.860    toward externally knowing the limits        100    00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.220    that are set for you by others give you        101    00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.120    a place to point a different finger        102    00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.639    I am talking about the        103    00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.479    middle one        104    00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.520    in other words limitations set by        105    00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.280    yourself give you boundaries to respect        106    00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.000    but limitations set by others give you        107    00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.120    boundaries to bust through        108    00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.220    as a young woman trying to break into a        109    00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.800    film in Hong Kong I was confronted with        110    00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.380    limitations at every turn initially        111    00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.520    casting stereotypical roles the demure        112    00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.220    docile Damsel in Distress I soon        113    00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.740    realized that what I wanted to play were        114    00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.419    the action roles        115    00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.340    the heroes        116    00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.060    of course these were then reserved        117    00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.580    exclusively for men but I could see that        118    00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.440    their fight sequences were highly        119    00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.180    choreographed and I knew in my bones        120    00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.000    that my dance training would allow me to        121    00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.600    excel at them if only I would given the        122    00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.620    chance        123    00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.380    so I went to my producer and said I did        124    00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.699    say please        125    00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.699    I want an action role I was prepared to        126    00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.860    do everything the men were doing the        127    00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.380    choreography the sons taking the blows        128    00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.220    the wire work all of it what like it's        129    00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.520    hard        130    00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.790    [Music]        131    00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.120    but when the chance finally came I knew        132    00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.060    it was make or break I had a one shot to        133    00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.340    prove my bank ability as an action star        134    00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.100    and if I failed I would not get that        135    00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.860    opportunity again so I see the moment        136    00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.500    with everything I had and as it turned        137    00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.139    out thankfully audiences were more than        138    00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:30.660    ready for a female star in action        139    00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.479    comedies the film yes Madam was well        140    00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:36.479    received and launched my career        141    00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.020    I knew I had it made it then when I soon        142    00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.979    after I joined Jet Li and Jackie Chan as        143    00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:46.520    the three people who Hong Kong insurers        144    00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.120    refused to cover        145    00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.680    they took one look at the scenes we were        146    00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.500    shooting and ran for the Hills        147    00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.220    I wore that as a badge of honor        148    00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.620    eventually things progressed and before        149    00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.840    I knew it I was regularly running on        150    00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.720    rooftops riding motorcycles onto moving        151    00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.759    trains and rolling off bands onto        152    00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:10.620    oncoming traffic don't try that at home        153    00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.580    okay        154    00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.800    there were injuries as you can imagine        155    00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.259    but with every Nick and scratch and        156    00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:18.900    bruise and fractured vertebrae I came        157    00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.960    back better and braver        158    00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.180    learning how to fall        159    00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.840    teaches you how to learn and learning to        160    00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.900    land gives you the courage to jump        161    00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.699    higher        162    00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:34.800    so when the James Bond producers knocked        163    00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.419    on my door about a film called Tomorrow        164    00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:40.020    Never Dies I thought yes they want me to        165    00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.860    play James Bond        166    00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:50.880    [Applause]        167    00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.520    I was fortunate that the producers        168    00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.319    Barbara broccoli and Michael G Wilson        169    00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:57.960    had a substantial role in mind in the        170    00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.139    character of Wei Lin a formidable agent        171    00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:03.360    who was always one step of her        172    00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.020    adversaries and equal to bond        173    00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.880    many regard that character as        174    00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.740    instrumental in modernizing the        175    00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.259    franchise and its retrograde portrayals        176    00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:15.419    of women so thank you Barbara and        177    00:08:15.419 --> 00:08:16.680    Michael        178    00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.379    although ba office came in after the        179    00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:22.560    Bond movie I waited two years for the        180    00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.960    proper role rejecting scripts that liked        181    00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.599    Nuance or depth in their character        182    00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:30.840    honestly there were times I had doubts        183    00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.240    as to whether I was doing the right        184    00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.159    thing in waiting        185    00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:39.240    after all actors want to act        186    00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.360    however I knew I would not be happy        187    00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.779    unless I continue to seek out roles that        188    00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:48.899    allowed me and like-minded creatives to        189    00:08:48.899 --> 00:08:51.779    dig deeper and reflect three-dimensional        190    00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:54.360    Humanity on stage        191    00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.339    and that was Crouching Tiger Hidden        192    00:08:56.339 --> 00:08:57.190    Dragon        193    00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:00.269    [Music]        194    00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.779    so I must have done something right        195    00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:04.860    because        196    00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.220    I am busier than ever these examples        197    00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.980    illustrate the importance of limitations        198    00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.500    because our limitations become our        199    00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.660    challenges and there is nothing like a        200    00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.300    challenge to keep you working striving        201    00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.760    and pushing for more        202    00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.160    every demeaning role I was offered every        203    00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.560    rejection I was handed and every time        204    00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.920    someone underestimated me I found energy        205    00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.980    and renewed motivation        206    00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.860    this brings me to the Third        207    00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.600    and final tip        208    00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.360    find your people        209    00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.320    life is not always a zero-sum game        210    00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.140    for every winner there doesn't have to        211    00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.680    be a loser in fact most success stories        212    00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.779    are less about competition and more        213    00:09:51.779 --> 00:09:53.519    about collaboration        214    00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:56.399    the truth is I could not have done any        215    00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:58.440    of this alone        216    00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.899    my achievements are the results of those        217    00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:03.899    around me who offered and continue to        218    00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:06.720    offer support and belief there are times        219    00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.459    where as much as I don't want to let        220    00:10:08.459 --> 00:10:11.040    myself down I don't want to let them        221    00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.839    down even more        222    00:10:12.839 --> 00:10:15.480    my definition of community is vast        223    00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.240    including my family loved ones and        224    00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.820    friends but it also includes the other        225    00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.399    actors directors producers some people        226    00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:26.339    film Crews dancers musicians and artists        227    00:10:26.339 --> 00:10:29.220    with whom I've crossed paths        228    00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.700    my community transcends time        229    00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.980    in the sense that I stand on the        230    00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.019    shoulders of those who have come before        231    00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:41.040    me and I am energized and inspired by        232    00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.680    those who come after me        233    00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.500    my community extends Beyond people I        234    00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.480    know personally which is why        235    00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.540    representation matters and why diversity        236    00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:55.380    on and off the screen have been a major        237    00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.380    priority for me particularly for women        238    00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.920    and particularly in lead roles        239    00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.500    when we shine a light on the rich and        240    00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.100    varied world around us we empower the        241    00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.160    whole of our Humanity I can see no        242    00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.720    better reason to wake up in the morning        243    00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.579    and get to work        244    00:11:14.579 --> 00:11:17.640    lastly my community is not limited to        245    00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.640    the film industry in my work as undp        246    00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.820    Goodwill Ambassador I have witnessed the        247    00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.220    Deep inequalities that continue to        248    00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.680    plague societies around the world and I        249    00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.560    have seen up close how women        250    00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.260    and girls are often the last to get        251    00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.779    essential services like clean water and        252    00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:40.560    vaccines especially in crisis for this        253    00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.380    reason I have committed myself in        254    00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.820    walking in lockstep with their struggle        255    00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.079    the prerequisite        256    00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.100    the prerequisite to change is empathy        257    00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.060    seeing through other people's        258    00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.880    perspective activates our compassion        259    00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.120    which becomes the driving force for real        260    00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.019    world demonstrable action        261    00:12:12.019 --> 00:12:15.420    compassion is the ultimate superpower        262    00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.579    within us        263    00:12:17.579 --> 00:12:19.620    when you are leaping without a safety        264    00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.640    net people become your safety net and        265    00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.399    you become theirs        266    00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:28.980    so those are my tips        267    00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.480    stay loose        268    00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.459    know your limits and find your people        269    00:12:35.459 --> 00:12:37.800    but I want to conclude by speaking        270    00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.440    briefly about that little movie that        271    00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.920    could everything everywhere all at once        272    00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.600    this was a film that in many ways brings        273    00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.639    together all the insights I have shared        274    00:12:56.639 --> 00:13:01.079    with you today it defied genre        275    00:13:01.079 --> 00:13:04.800    playing loose with free expectations and        276    00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.440    defying categorization a flouted        277    00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.019    limitation by taking a smaller budget        278    00:13:10.019 --> 00:13:12.139    and turning it into an international        279    00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:15.060    phenomenon and it brought together a        280    00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.160    community of creative and talented        281    00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.720    individuals        282    00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.779    working with a common passion to tell a        283    00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:25.079    universal human story        284    00:13:25.079 --> 00:13:27.959    this wasn't wow I'm creating waves as I        285    00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:30.200    can see        286    00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.300    this was a movie made entirely with love        287    00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.959    that was in many ways the culmination of        288    00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:39.740    my life's work        289    00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:42.240    and the reverberations of that love        290    00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.480    continue to be felt as everything        291    00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.420    everywhere all at once has caused a        292    00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.180    tectonic shift in the industry opening        293    00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.940    the door to more independent efforts and        294    00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.280    greater Asian representation        295    00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:06.839    [Applause]        296    00:14:06.839 --> 00:14:10.320    when I think of a glorious leap into an        297    00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.839    unknown void        298    00:14:12.839 --> 00:14:15.000    I think of

--> 00:14:35.160    then leave and then leap again and leap        305    00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.920    again I look forward to living in the        306    00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.440    world

   00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.390    - I suspect that many of    you are sitting here today        2    00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.270    as newly minted Harvard graduates        3    00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.940    wondering what the future holds for you.        4    00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.010    I actually can relate to that.        5    00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.080    As you know, this is my last commencement        6    00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.560    and I'm actually pondering    the same question.        7    00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.520    Like you, I'm contemplating    what happens next.        8    00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.010    Whatever your dreams are today,        9    00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.520    I wish for you what you wish for yourself,        10    00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.490    and I hope that living a meaningful life        11    00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.920    is high on your list.        12    00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.153    What do I mean by that?        13    00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.390    You've worked extremely hard    to earn your Harvard degree        14    00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.680    but you're also extremely fortunate        15    00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.943    to be sitting here today.        16    00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.840    With education, with good    fortune comes responsibility,        17    00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.353    including looking beyond    your success to help others.        18    00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.060    No one accomplishes anything    in life on their own.        19    00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.010    At the beginning of this ceremony,        20    00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.160    I asked you to recognize    your friends and families        21    00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.640    who have supported you, and you did,        22    00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.033    but you have also received    support from countless others.        23    00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.890    For example, those who    pushed and encouraged you        24    00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.160    and who may have    recognized something in you        25    00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.730    that you did not recognize in yourself.        26    00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.800    Those who had confidence in you        27    00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.570    even before you proved    yourself worthy of their trust.        28    00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.053    Those who extended themselves    to open doors for you.        29    00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.880    And to all of these, you can    add the invisible others,        30    00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.780    those who volunteered their    time to create organizations        31    00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.330    that have been central to your life.        32    00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.120    Those who worked to build institutions        33    00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.890    that nurtured your capacities,    talents, and ambitions.        34    00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.200    Those who helped to sustain        35    00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.140    and strengthen this great university,        36    00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.160    which I hope has left    its mark on each of you        37    00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.303    and from which you now    graduate, I could go on.        38    00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.590    Soon, it will be your turn    to extend the helping hand        39    00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.890    and to create hope and    opportunity for others.        40    00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.270    We expect this of you and even more.        41    00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.790    I've never met anyone who thinks        42    00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.910    the world we live in is perfect.        43    00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.220    This is a statement that's equally true        44    00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.780    of liberals and conservatives,    Democrats and Republicans,        45    00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.010    and those across the political spectrum.        46    00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.880    So, if you believe the world is imperfect,        47    00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.580    the only way it will get better        48    00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.783    is if good people like    you work to repair it.        49    00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.743    This is now your responsibility.        50    00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.520    Harvard gave me a great education,        51    00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.270    but it also raised my    expectations for myself.        52    00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.840    It opened my eyes to what is possible.        53    00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.970    At my commencement,        54    00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.020    I never imagined that someday    I would be standing here        55    00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.610    giving the final remarks    at your commencement.        56    00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.670    I hope as you find your way through life        57    00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.080    that you will have similarly    pleasant surprises.        58    00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.910    And now to all of those        59    00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.370    who helped me through the path of life,        60    00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.320    to those who gave me opportunities        61    00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.630    that I never could have imagined,        62    00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.310    to those who gave me the    extraordinary responsibility        63    00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.670    to lead Harvard over    these past five years,        64    00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.510    and those who helped    me do it, I thank you.        65    00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.380    And to Adele, my wife of 48 years,        66    00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.860    who's been my partner of    this incredible journey        67    00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.860    and all others, thank you.        68    00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.483    I love you.    (audience applauding)        69    00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:55.920    As I prepare to take my leave,        70    00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.600    I'm reminded of a quotation    from a ""Book of Wisdom.""        71    00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.510    It's called Ethics of Our Fathers.        72    00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.593    It's the meditation of a great    teacher and a great scholar.        73    00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.820    I have learned much from my teachers,        74    00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.820    more from my colleagues,    but most from my students.        75    00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.980    To the class of 2023, thank    you for teaching me so well.        76    00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.830    I'm grateful to each and every one of you        77    00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.830    for being a constant source    of hope and optimism.        78    00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.930    Serving as your president has    been the privilege of my life.        79    00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.090    I look forward eagerly to celebrating all        80    00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.070    that you will do for the world        81    00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.360    and all those whose    lives will be made better        82    00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.640    by your good work.        83    00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.080    To the class of 2023, thank you, farewell        84    00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.033    and God speed.

(students cheering)        29    00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:34.210    So as you all know,        30    00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.820    the motto of this    university is, ""Veritas,""        31    00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.450    so let me begin by sharing something        32    00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.313    that actually happens to be true.        33    00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.120    The view from here is    really, really amazing.        34    00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.870    I can't actually believe    that we finally did it.        35    00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.770    We all managed to come    together in person like this.        36    00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.240    It's just wonderful.        37    00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.400    Being here, being    together at long last is,        38    00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.920    frankly, moving beyond words,        39    00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.110    but to our graduates,        40    00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.613    you guys did not get here alone.        41    00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.490    Nobody in the world accomplishes    anything on their own.        42    00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.010    So I wanna ask you now,        43    00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.720    to please rise,        44    00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.600    turn and thank the people,        45    00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.080    your friends, your    family, your loved ones,        46    00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.870    who actually helped you    to make it to this moment.        47    00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.270    Let's turn and congratulate    and thank all of them        48    00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.168    for helping you all get here.        49    00:02:34.168 --> 00:02:37.168    (students cheering)        50    00:02:52.537 --> 00:02:53.370    Thank you.        51    00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.530    I love seeing the waves coming back        52    00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.043    in the opposite direction.        53    00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.740    So now that you're all settled your seats,        54    00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.540    let me share another truth with you.        55    00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.910    Something very inconvenient happens        56    00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.080    when we combine a pandemic        57    00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.170    with a global supply chain    shortage and problem,        58    00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.800    and that is,        59    00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.730    not enough folding    chairs/seats to go around.        60    00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.350    I'm actually, I'm not kidding you,        61    00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.420    with all the commencements    that are going on        62    00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.160    and dual commencements and    extended commencements,        63    00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.200    just like we're doing here,        64    00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.580    we actually had problems    finding enough chairs.        65    00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.770    Half of you almost wound up    sitting on blankets today.        66    00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.771    I'm not gonna tell you which half.        67    00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:37.310    (students laughing)        68    00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.910    Fortunately, our amazing staff,        69    00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.150    the people who really make this place run,        70    00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.790    who make it possible    for all of us to gather,        71    00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.330    who support us in so many ways,        72    00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.930    figured out a way around The    Great Seat Scramble of 2022.        73    00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.030    Now I'm telling you all of this,        74    00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.770    because this is likely the    last time in your lives        75    00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.820    that you almost did not get a seat.        76    00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.760    Soon, you're gonna have a    degree from an institution        77    00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.640    whose name is known no matter    where you go in the world,        78    00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.020    an institution whose name is    synonymous with excellence,        79    00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:21.020    ambition, achievement and    maybe some other modifiers        80    00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.850    on which we needn't dwell on today.        81    00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.890    You'll hear those in the future.        82    00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.200    But with your degree in hand,        83    00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.200    you may often find yourself    invited to sit and stay a while,        84    00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.480    invited to share your thoughts and ideas,        85    00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.560    invited to participate, to contribute,        86    00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.460    yes, to lead.        87    00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.250    Who knows?        88    00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.640    Someday, one of you may find    yourself standing up here,        89    00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.500    like me, welcoming a    future graduating class        90    00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.380    and congratulating them    on their accomplishment.        91    00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.830    Now if that seems far-fetched,        92    00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.540    I guarantee you that when I    graduated from this place,        93    00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.430    I never could have imagined    this is where I would wind up.        94    00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.020    Now, what have you all    to make of all that?        95    00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.220    The fact that people are    gonna make room for you,        96    00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.540    basically to find a seat for you.        97    00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.500    You could take that for granted.        98    00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.943    You could assume that you    deserved it all along,        99    00:05:22.842 --> 00:05:25.663    but what a waste that would be.        100    00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.240    Today, I wanna challenge you,        101    00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.710    members of the Harvard Class of 2022,        102    00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.562    to save a seat for others,        103    00:05:34.562 --> 00:05:36.390    to make room for others,        104    00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.230    to ensure that the opportunities    afforded by your education        105    00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.613    do not enrich your life alone.        106    00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.950    You will have more chances than most        107    00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.350    to make differences in the world,        108    00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.350    more opportunities to give    others a chance at a better life.        109    00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.373    Take advantage of these    opportunities when they arise.        110    00:06:00.881 --> 00:06:03.623    Whatever you do with    your Harvard education,        111    00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.710    please be known as much for your humility,        112    00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.130    kindness and concern for others        113    00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.370    as for your professional accomplishments.        114    00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:20.370    Recognize the role that good    fortune and circumstance        115    00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.800    have played in your life.        116    00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.800    And please, please work to    extend opportunity to others        117    00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.470    just as it has been extended to you.        118    00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.910    That actually, is how you will sustain        119    00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.670    the pride and joy you feel today,        120    00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.853    and that's also true.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.500    I paid tribute to all    of the esteemed guests        9    00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.500    who stand here in this    great forest of knowledge.        10    00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.250    I am truly privileged to be here        11    00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.743    and I thank you for the honor.        12    00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.700    There are some moments in life        13    00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.653    that make the world feel    small and connected.        14    00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.393    This is not one of them.        15    00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.390    I'm used to walking into    a room in New Zealand        16    00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.503    and knowing at least someone.        17    00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.930    It is one of the beautiful things        18    00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.093    about a small country like my own.        19    00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.460    And while this moment feels    incredibly daunting to me        20    00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.860    right now, I do take comfort knowing        21    00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.423    there are around 30 New    Zealanders studying here.        22    00:01:31.785 --> 00:01:34.535    (crowd clapping)        23    00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.639    And statistically, at least    one of them will be my cousin.        24    00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:45.389    (crowd laughing)        25    00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.980    But then there are some moments    that serve to remind you        26    00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.350    that despite distance,        27    00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.900    despite vastly different    histories and experiences,        28    00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.893    there are many things that connect us.        29    00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.210    In June 1989, the Prime    Minister of Pakistan        30    00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.460    stood on this spot and delivered    the commencement address        31    00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.077    titled ""Democratic Nations Must Unite.""        32    00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.190    She spoke about her journey,    the importance of citizenry,        33    00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.853    representative government,    human rights, and democracy.        34    00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.090    I met Benazir Bhutto in    Geneva in June of 2007.        35    00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.580    We both attended a    conference that drew together        36    00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.223    progressive parties from around the world.        37    00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.533    Seven months later, she was assassinated.        38    00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.950    Now there will be opinions    and differing perspectives        39    00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.340    written about all of us    as political leaders.        40    00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.070    Two things that history will not contest        41    00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.473    about Benazir Bhutto.        42    00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.660    She was the first Muslim    female prime minister        43    00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.940    elected in an Islamic country        44    00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.333    when women in power was a rare thing.        45    00:03:08.348 --> 00:03:11.098    (crowd cheering)        46    00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.340    She was also the first    to give birth in office.        47    00:03:19.826 --> 00:03:22.576    (crowd cheering)        48    00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.120    The second and only other leader        49    00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.700    to have given birth in office,        50    00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.753    almost 30 years later, was me.        51    00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.870    My daughter Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford        52    00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.653    was born on the 21st of June, 2018,        53    00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.373    Benazir Bhutto's birthday.        54    00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.380    The path she carved as a    woman feels as relevant today        55    00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.630    as it was decades ago.        56    00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.630    And so too is the message she    shared here in this place.        57    00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.233    She said partway through her    speech in 1989 the following,        58    00:04:13.277 --> 00:04:18.277    ""We must realize that    democracy can be fragile.""        59    00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.890    Now I read those words    as I sat in my office        60    00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.553    in Wellington, New Zealand,    a world away from Pakistan.        61    00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.370    And while the reasons that    gave rise to her words then        62    00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.973    were vastly different,    they still ring true.        63    00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.653    Democracy can be fragile.        64    00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.970    This imperfect, but precious    way that we organize ourselves        65    00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.730    that has been created to give equal voice        66    00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.570    to the weak and to the strong,        67    00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.683    that is designed to help drive consensus.        68    00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.003    It is fragile.        69    00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.740    For years, it feels as    though we have assumed        70    00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.740    that the fragility of democracy    was determined by duration.        71    00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.520    That somehow the strength    of your democracy        72    00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.350    was like a marriage.        73    00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.090    The longer you'd been in it,        74    00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.330    the more likely it was to stick        75    00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.483    But that takes so much for granted.        76    00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.570    It ignores the fact that        77    00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.610    the foundation of a strong democracy        78    00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.610    includes trust in institutions,    experts, and government.        79    00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.930    And that this can be    built up over decades,        80    00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.963    but torn down in mere years,        81    00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.010    It takes for granted    that a strong democracy        82    00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.170    relies on debate and dialogue.        83    00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.930    And even the oldest regimes can    seek to control these forums        84    00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.563    and the youngest can    seek to liberate them.        85    00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.930    It ignores what happens,    when regardless of        86    00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.970    how long your democracy    has been tried and tested,        87    00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.360    when facts are turned into fiction        88    00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.280    and fiction turned into fact,        89    00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.973    you stop debating ideas and    you start debating conspiracy.        90    00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.030    It ignores the reality of    what we are now confronted by        91    00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.243    every single day.        92    00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.063    Forgive me while I take a water break.        93    00:06:27.461 --> 00:06:30.211    (crowd clapping)        94    00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.750    You know it's a nice crowd        95    00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.783    when a drink of water elicit applause.        96    00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.580    Now, where I come from,        97    00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.010    we have a parliamentary    representative democracy.        98    00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.800    Without giving you a litany    of fun facts on New Zealand        99    00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.130    that you are unlikely to need again,        100    00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.630    here is the very brief version.        101    00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.420    We have a mixed member    proportional system,        102    00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.470    which essentially means every vote counts        103    00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.280    and it's ensured that our parliament        104    00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.690    better reflects our communities.        105    00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.526    Almost 50% of our parliament are women.        106    00:07:04.526 --> 00:07:07.276    (crowd cheering)        107    00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.580    Almost 20% are Maori, the    indigenous people of New Zealand.        108    00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:17.584    (crowd cheering)        109    00:07:19.603 --> 00:07:23.820    And our deputy prime    minister is a proud gay man        110    00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.820    and sits among several other    rainbow parliamentarians.        111    00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.710    (crowd cheering)        112    00:07:34.109 --> 00:07:38.890    In the past 10 years, we    have passed laws that include        113    00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.610    everything from the    introduction of gay marriage        114    00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.970    and the banning of conversion therapy,        115    00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.280    right through to embedding        116    00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.540    a 1.5 degree climate    change target into law,        117    00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:54.019    banning military style    semiautomatics and assault rifles,        118    00:07:54.019 --> 00:07:56.769    (crowd cheering)        119    00:08:17.095 --> 00:08:20.262    and the decriminalization of abortion.        120    00:08:22.342 --> 00:08:25.092    (crowd cheering)        121    00:08:31.822 --> 00:08:36.822    These are significant issues        122    00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:41.120    and they have not been    without debate and difference,        123    00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.620    but they are all examples of times        124    00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.410    where we have navigated    times of deep change        125    00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.373    without, for the most    part, leaving deep rifts.        126    00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.850    But we have also seen the opposite.        127    00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.300    Whether it's democratic elections    that erupt into violence        128    00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:03.300    or the COVID crisis emerging    and exposing mistrust        129    00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.070    of experts, institutions, and governments.        130    00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:11.010    Western democracies are seeing    it and experiencing examples,        131    00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.933    and New Zealand is no different.        132    00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.460    Now I will admit feeling some trepidation        133    00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.460    entering a discussion on how    we strengthen our democracies        134    00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.930    when this issue is so    easily and wrongly distorted        135    00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.693    to being opposed to free speech.        136    00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.650    But that fear is overshadowed    by a greater fear        137    00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.750    of what will happen to our democracies        138    00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:40.750    if we don't act to firm    up our foundations,        139    00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.840    if we don't find once again        140    00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.590    our ability to argue our corners, yes,        141    00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.140    with the passion and fire    that conviction brings.        142    00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:54.860    But without the vitriol,    hate, and violence.        143    00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.460    If we don't find a way    to ensure difference,        144    00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:02.110    that space where perspectives,    experience, and debate        145    00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.520    give rise to understanding and compromise,        146    00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.520    doesn't instead become division,    the place of entrenchment.        147    00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.180    Where dialogue departs, solutions shatter,        148    00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.810    and a crevice between us becomes so deep        149    00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.733    that no one dares cross to the other side.        150    00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.360    We are at a precipice and rather than ask        151    00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.480    what caused it today,        152    00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.053    I want to talk about how we address it.        153    00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.563    Now, I am not an academic.        154    00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:36.810    I accept that the robes on this occasion        155    00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.973    aren't exactly truth in advertising.        156    00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.150    Rather, I am a politician    from Morrinsville.        157    00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.100    As a point of geographic reference,        158    00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.593    it's right next to Hobbiton.        159    00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.370    I'm not actually joking.    (crowd laughing)        160    00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.250    But in that small rural    town of 5,000 people        161    00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.550    where I spent most of my formative years        162    00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.690    and will forever love for what it gave me,        163    00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.650    I lived in that important space        164    00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.363    that sits between difference and division.        165    00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:13.620    I was raised a Mormon in a town    where the dominant religions        166    00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.993    were Catholic, Anglican, and rugby.        167    00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.820    I was a woman interested in    politics, left wing politics,        168    00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:28.420    in a region that had never in    its entire democratic history        169    00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.693    elected anyone other than    a conservative candidate.        170    00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:36.600    Now these differences    were a part of my identity        171    00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.973    but never a source of isolation.        172    00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:46.420    But I am old and unquestionably,    things have changed.        173    00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.960    In fact, mine is the generation        174    00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:54.273    that sat on the cusp of the internet age.        175    00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.090    I remember the first person in my school        176    00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.210    who had access to the internet.        177    00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.570    Her name was Fiona Lindsay.        178    00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.390    Her father was the local accountant.        179    00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.920    After he shut the office for the day,        180    00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.370    we would get the key        181    00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.760    and log onto his massive desktop computers        182    00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.000    with screens so wide that    the desks were tiered        183    00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.140    to fit the whole thing in.        184    00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:24.120    It was the 1990s, the interface        185    00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.890    and even what we used the internet for        186    00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.133    in those days was different.        187    00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.710    For a time, it was almost    as if the directory        188    00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:37.050    for this vast landscape didn't exist.        189    00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:40.530    It was a modern ham radio.        190    00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:44.940    You would dial in and    talk to someone, anyone.        191    00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.080    It was a spontaneity of connection that,        192    00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.423    in some ways, mirrored real life.        193    00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:53.310    But as the opportunities    to connect expanded,        194    00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.620    humans did what we have always done.        195    00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.423    We organized ourselves.        196    00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.840    Social media platforms were born,        197    00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.850    offering the promise of    connection and reconnection.        198    00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:10.560    We logged on in our billions,    forming tribes and sub tribes.        199    00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.620    We published our thoughts,    feelings, and ideas freely.        200    00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.310    We found a place to    share information, facts,        201    00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.880    fiction dressed up as facts, memes,        202    00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.980    and more cat videos than    you ever thought possible.        203    00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.800    We found a place to experience    new ways of thinking        204    00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.540    and to celebrate our difference.        205    00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:36.213    But increasingly, we use it    to do neither of those things.        206    00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:41.530    Now I doubt anyone here has    ever created a group titled        207    00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.320    political views I disagree with        208    00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.760    but choose to enter into    respectful dialogue with        209    00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.427    to better understand    alternative perspectives.        210    00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.130    As humans, we are naturally predisposed        211    00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:57.750    to reinforce our own views    together with people like us        212    00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.350    and avoid that dreaded sense    of cognitive dissonance.        213    00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.770    We seek validation,    confirmation, reinforcement,        214    00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.650    increasingly with the help of algorithms.        215    00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.510    What we seek we are served,        216    00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.880    sometimes before we    even know we're looking.        217    00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.840    Now, I'm not here to argue        218    00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.500    that social media is good nor bad.        219    00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.980    It's a tool.        220    00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.470    And as with anything,    it's the rules of the game        221    00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.910    and the way we engage    with it that matters.        222    00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:29.690    But social media matters a lot        223    00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.693    and perhaps much more than we thought.        224    00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:38.330    On the 15th of March,    2019, 51 people were killed        225    00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.960    in a terrorist attack on two mosques        226    00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.160    in Christchurch, New Zealand.        227    00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.053    The entire brutal act was    live streamed on social media.        228    00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.230    The Royal Commission    that followed found that        229    00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:56.093    the terrorist responsible    was radicalized online.        230    00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.900    Now in the aftermath of    New Zealand's experience,        231    00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.980    we felt a sense of responsibility.        232    00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:07.150    We knew that we needed    significant gun reform.        233    00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.303    And so that is what we did.        234    00:15:10.874 --> 00:15:13.624    (crowd clapping)        235    00:15:19.637 --> 00:15:23.100    But we also knew that if    we wanted genuine solutions        236    00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.700    to the issue of violent extremism online,        237    00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:30.030    it would take government, civil society,        238    00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.480    and the tech companies        239    00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.790    to come together and change the landscape.        240    00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:38.563    And the result was the    Christchurch Call to Action.        241    00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.910    And while much has changed as a result,        242    00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.073    important things haven't.        243    00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:49.160    The time has come for    social media companies        244    00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.950    and other online providers        245    00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.633    to recognize their power and to act on it.        246    00:15:55.574 --> 00:15:58.324    (crowd clapping)        247    00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:06.380    That means upholding their    own basic terms of service.        248    00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.740    That means recognizing the role they play        249    00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.870    in constantly curating and shaping        250    00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:16.060    the online environments that we are in.        251    00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:20.010    That algorithmic processes    make choices and decisions        252    00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:24.560    for us, what we see and    where we are directed.        253    00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.610    And at best, that means    that the user experience        254    00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:29.430    is personalized.        255    00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:33.080    But at worst, it means the user experience        256    00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.270    can be radicalized.        257    00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:39.380    It means that there is a    pressing and urgent need        258    00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.470    for responsible algorithm    development and deployment.        259    00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:48.470    Now we have the forums    for online providers        260    00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.120    and social media companies    to work on these issues        261    00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.970    alongside civil society and governments.        262    00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:57.170    And we have every reason to do it.        263    00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.860    Let's start with transparency        264    00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.810    in how algorithmic processes work        265    00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:02.920    and the outcomes they deliver.        266    00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.360    But let's finish with a shared approach        267    00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:10.360    to responsible algorithms    because the time has come.        268    00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.720    But the tech companies, they    are only part of the answer.        269    00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:26.220    What we do as individuals    in these spaces matters too.        270    00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.550    Our willingness to recognize    our own preconceived ideas,        271    00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.970    the level of critique we    apply to what we engage with,        272    00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:36.570    and how we uphold our    basic sense of humanity        273    00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.870    when interacting with others.        274    00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:42.930    There's a term that gets    thrown around a lot.        275    00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.380    Keyboard warrior.        276    00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.760    It's used to refer to someone        277    00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.380    who makes aggressive or    abusive posts online,        278    00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.410    often anonymously.        279    00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:52.750    Now I like the name.        280    00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.690    In my mind, when I read something        281    00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.470    especially horrific on my feed,        282    00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:59.080    I imagine it's written by a lone person        283    00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.550    unacquainted with    personal hygiene practices        284    00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.950    dressed in a poorly    fitted super hero costume,        285    00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.130    one that is baggy in all the wrong places.        286    00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.750    Now, keyboard warrior or not though,        287    00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:15.770    it's still something that    has been written by a human.        288    00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.643    And it's something that's    been read by one, too.        289    00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:24.640    Now I do my own social    media, I always have.        290    00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:28.700    After all, it is being described    as the new town square.        291    00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.530    But we all know that it's more than just        292    00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:33.033    news and information    being shared these days.        293    00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.930    Recently, I had the privilege of joining        294    00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:38.550    ex German Chancellor    Angela Merkel on a panel.        295    00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.460    Now I have long been in    awe of her leadership,        296    00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.600    not least for her endurance.        297    00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.190    She was in power for 16 years.        298    00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:49.110    I once asked her how she managed it.        299    00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:53.097    Her response was quote,    ""things have changed a lot.""        300    00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.230    In the panel discussion, she reflected        301    00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:58.437    on some of that change    by commenting the quote,        302    00:18:58.437 --> 00:19:01.160    ""In the old days, we had certain events        303    00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.037    that happened in societies    and television reported it.        304    00:19:04.037 --> 00:19:06.870    And the next day,    everyone talked about it.        305    00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.070    Today, even that simple act has changed.        306    00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.650    What we consider to be the    mainstream media outlets        307    00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:16.310    have proliferated, but    ownership structures have not.        308    00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.070    Mainstream media have layers        309    00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.580    of accountabilities and    journalistic expectation        310    00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:25.360    that others who also present    information to us, don't.        311    00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.500    There is competition    in advertising revenue        312    00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.080    with subscription services and paywalls,        313    00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.250    all to aid in the survival of the fittest.        314    00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:35.480    With fittest now defined by how easy it is        315    00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.033    to monetize your content.        316    00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.970    And in amongst all of that lies the fact,        317    00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.460    we're not talking about    how we access information        318    00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.530    to inform debate,        319    00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.193    but whether you can call    it information at all.        320    00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.420    Now there are those    far more learned than I        321    00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.510    who will argue where the source        322    00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.640    of the scourge of disinformation lies.        323    00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.770    Within your own campus, you    have those who will argue        324    00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.170    that the current problems    of disinformation        325    00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.960    are not the result of algorithms or trolls        326    00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.760    but of, quote, ""asymmetric    media structures,""        327    00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.233    decades in the making.        328    00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.553    I'm not here to argue either    way because at its heart,        329    00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.793    what we're in the middle of    is not really a new problem.        330    00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.030    Thomas Rid argues that the    modern era of disinformation        331    00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:27.343    began in the early 1920s    during the Great Depression.        332    00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.060    In an era of journalism    transformed by radio,        333    00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.573    newly cut throat and fast paced.        334    00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.760    He goes on to argue that    it's since come in waves,        335    00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.500    including in the mid 2010,        336    00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.070    with disinformation reborn and reshaped        337    00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.403    by new technologies and internet culture.        338    00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.250    Others point to the acceleration        339    00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.210    of the information and disinformation flow        340    00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.700    that comes with each new technology        341    00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.810    that enables mass    duplication and distribution,        342    00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:57.720    from photocopiers to cassette tapes.        343    00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.230    The only thing that has changed is speed.        344    00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:04.827    But as Rid concludes, either    way, the stakes are, quote,        345    00:21:04.827 --> 00:21:08.340    ""enormous, for disinformation corrodes        346    00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.990    the foundation of our liberal democracy,        347    00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:14.870    our ability to assess    facts on their merits,        348    00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:18.100    and to adjust cause accordingly.""        349    00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.410    Now I accept the picture I'm painting        350    00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:25.090    may seem overwhelming and insurmountable        351    00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:29.363    and a little bit grim, but    I'm an optimist at heart.        352    00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.330    And while we cannot change everything        353    00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:38.330    about the environment we are    in, we can change ourselves        354    00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.570    to build greater strength and resilience        355    00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.320    in spite of the headwinds around us.        356    00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.613    And I see examples of that every day.        357    00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:55.570    Leah Bell and Waimarama    Anderson were two young students        358    00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.210    from a public school in New Zealand        359    00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:59.600    called Otorohanga College.        360    00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.790    Now they couldn't understand    why every young New Zealander        361    00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:03.770    didn't learn at school    about New Zealand history,        362    00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:06.130    including the New Zealand Wars,        363    00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:09.670    conflict between British and    colonial troops and Maori        364    00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:11.200    in the 19th century.        365    00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.940    Now, these two students pushed for change,        366    00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:18.940    presenting a petition to    parliament, and they succeeded.        367    00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.040    Next year for the first time,        368    00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.000    our young people are universally learning        369    00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.783    about their past, their    culture, and their history.        370    00:22:29.044 --> 00:22:31.794    (crowd clapping)        371    00:22:35.075 --> 00:22:36.070    But what is important here        372    00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:40.140    is just not what our young    people learn, but how.        373    00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.830    In a disinformation age, we need to learn        374    00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.660    how to analyze and critique information.        375    00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.910    Now that doesn't mean teaching mistrust        376    00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:52.570    but rather as my old history    teacher, Mr. Fountain extolled,        377    00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:55.070    to quote, ""understand the limitations        378    00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:57.280    of a single piece of information        379    00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.540    and that there is always a range        380    00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.380    of perspectives on events and decisions.""        381    00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.110    Our history shows us    the importance of this.        382    00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:08.700    But so too does our presence.        383    00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:13.700    You are and will always    be surrounded by bias.        384    00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:18.550    You will continue to be    exposed to disinformation.        385    00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:21.400    And over time, the noise    you are surrounded by        386    00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.480    will probably only get worse.        387    00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.710    And perhaps that is why,        388    00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:29.230    when your own constitution was adopted,        389    00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:32.260    Benjamin Franklin was    asked what had been created        390    00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:37.260    and he replied quote, ""A    Republic, if you can keep it.""        391    00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.920    If you can keep it.        392    00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:45.920    Yes, diversity of voice and    mainstream media matters.        393    00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:50.970    The responsibility of    social media matters.        394    00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:53.730    Teaching our kids to    deal with disinformation        395    00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:57.650    and the role we play as    leaders, it all matters.        396    00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.473    But so do you.        397    00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:03.930    How you choose to engage with information,        398    00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:08.530    deal with conflict, how    you confront debate,        399    00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:11.990    how you choose to address    being baited or hated.        400    00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:14.360    It all matters.        401    00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.477    In the overwhelming challenges    that lay in front of us        402    00:24:17.477 --> 00:24:21.050    and our constant efforts    to reach into the systems,        403    00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.040    the structures, the power.        404    00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.310    Don't overlook the simple act        405    00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:29.193    that are right in front of you.        406    00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:34.533    The impact that we each    have as individuals.        407    00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:40.460    To make a choice, to treat difference        408    00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:44.400    with empathy and with kindness,        409    00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.170    those values that exist in the space        410    00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:50.110    between difference and division.        411    00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.010    The very things we teach our children        412    00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:56.590    but then view as weakness in our leaders.        413    00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:59.840    The issues we navigate    as a society, after all,        414    00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.930    will only intensify.        415    00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:04.540    The disinformation will only increase.        416    00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:08.460    The pull into the comfort of    our tribes will be magnified.        417    00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.810    But we have it within us to ensure        418    00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:13.213    that that doesn't mean we fracture.        419    00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:17.270    We are richer for our difference        420    00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:20.120    and poorer for our division.        421    00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:23.200    Through genuine debate and dialogue,        422    00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:28.200    through rebuilding trust in    information and one another,        423    00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.440    through empathy,        424    00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.823    let us reclaim the space in between.        425    00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:39.650    After all, there are    some things in this life        426    00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:44.233    that make the world feel    small and connected.        427    00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.393    Let kindness be one of them.        428    00:25:50.771 --> 00:25:53.521    (crowd cheering)        "

I'M THE OLDEST CHILD OF IMMIGRANT        53    00:04:00.466 --> 00:04:04.966    PARENTS FROM TAIWAN.

BUT THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEAL        62    00:04:41.433 --> 00:04:51.233    WAS AFTER THE MEAL I WOULD STILL    FIND ROOM FOR SOFT SERVE ICE        63    00:04:51.233 --> 00:04:55.100    CREAM AND A GLORIOUS BOWL OF CLAM CHOWDER.

children burst        28    00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.360    into the room from time to time        29    00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.680    and gave us a little break from whatever        30

read more deeply and        44    00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.759    listen more carefully and write more        45    00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.360    truly        46    00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.920

49    00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.000    nervously and yet excitedly re-entered        50    00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.560    our classrooms        51    00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.200    it was your

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.519    it was you who were sometimes so much        55    00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.160    taller than we had imagined you would be        56    00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.360

dance floor        75    00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.080    you begin to unlock the possibilities        76    00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.239    of the new spaces around us        77    00:03:40.560 -->

    80    00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.280    of many disciplines and the scriptural        81    00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.599    language of holy books        82    00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.319    the

00:04:14.400    together        88    00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.000    it remains difficult to find the words        89    00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.639    to give an account of these times we        90    00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.199    have shared        91    00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.639    what language will suffice to speak of        92    00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.919    what this ongoing pandemic has meant        93    00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.880    and will come to mean        94    00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.400    what words        95    00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.600    are up to the task of comprehending the        96    00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.320    one million deaths        97    00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.720    from a disease that the last time we        98    00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.680    gathered in person for graduation        99    00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.360    no one had ever heard of        100    00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.360    when we celebrated the class of 2019 in        101    00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.280    this space        102    00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.720    george floyd        103    00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.919    was living his life        104    00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.360    two years ago today        105    00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.479    that life was taken from him in an act        106    00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:07.919    of violence        107    00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.039    that had the weight of american history        108    00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.680    behind it        109    00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.080    the last time we were in this space for        110    00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.000    this purpose        111    00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.039    ukrainian towns and cities        112    00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:22.720    now shattered        113    00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.600    were intact        114    00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.199    our uniquely american catastrophes        115    00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.720    continue to repeat themselves over and        116    00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.759    over        117    00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.479    unchanged        118    00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.120    in the days since katie capanera asked        119    00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.360    me to give this speech        120    00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.400    a white supremacist murdered 10 people        121    00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.840    doing their grocery shopping in buffalo        122    00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.360    and yesterday        123    00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.960    another gunman killed 19 little children        124    00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.720    and two of their teachers in their        125    00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.120    school        126    00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.720    how do we find the words we need        127    00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.639    to give an account of these events        128    00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:06.479    to speak of them        129    00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.560    to write of them        130    00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.120    to respond to them in a way        131    00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.240    that creates the conditions for us to        132    00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.440    change course        133    00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.800    saint augustine the great fifth century        134    00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.560    african bishop        135    00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.800    once wrote that when he wanted to speak        136    00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.120    of his faith to others he knew what he        137    00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.240    wanted to say inside himself        138    00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.560    but my words he wrote        139    00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.960    cannot suffice to my heart        140    00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.680    thinking of all that has happened during        141    00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.199    our time together at hds        142    00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:46.000    i feel the same way        143    00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.360    my words cannot suffice        144    00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.160    to my heart        145    00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:54.800    when the first lockdowns began        146    00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.000    the historical society of my church sent        147    00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.720    out a letter encouraging all of us to        148    00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.280    keep an account of these days        149    00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.759    and to archive it in their offices so        150    00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.160    that future generations could read about        151    00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160    what it was like to live through this        152    00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.360    time        153    00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.599    and perhaps some of you kept a journal        154    00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.840    during this these years i hope many of        155    00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.440    you did        156    00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.080    like daniel defoe and samuel peeps        157    00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.960    writing their daily accounts of life        158    00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.599    during the last surge of the bubonic        159    00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:26.960    plague        160    00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.440    i hope many of you bore witness to this        161    00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.479    time        162    00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:34.720    through making an account of your days        163    00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.199    i wish i could say that i did        164    00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:40.319    but i am at best an intermittent journal        165    00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:41.599    keeper        166    00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:43.680    always struggling to find the right        167    00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.080    words        168    00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.240    but journals are not the only way of        169    00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.479    creating an account of a moment in time        170    00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:56.560    letters sermons sound and song film        171    00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.400    painting poetry        172    00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.840    novels        173    00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.879    there are so many ways to explore our        174    00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:05.039    day        175    00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:08.000    the one that rings most true for my own        176    00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.039    life        177    00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:12.560    i found in valeria louiselli's novel        178    00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.840    lost children archive        179    00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.160    one of her narrators a sound        180    00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.560    documentarian writes        181    00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.800    i don't keep a journal        182    00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.400    my journals are the things i underline        183    00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.120    in books        184    00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.520    when i read that sentence        185    00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.479    i underlined it        186    00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.279    my journals are the things i underline        187    00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:40.399    in books that feels right to me        188    00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:42.159    and i think it might be a way of        189    00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.080    thinking about what we've been doing        190    00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.200    together        191    00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.440    students and teachers on zoom and off        192    00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.800    over these past two and a half years        193    00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.200    the way we've been making a record of        194    00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.720    this time        195    00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.279    together        196    00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:01.360    now medieval christian monks created a        197    00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.760    form for this kind of record        198    00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.600    when they were reading or copying a        199    00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.680    manuscript by hand        200    00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.080    if certain sentences shown with        201    00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.440    significance        202    00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.680    they would copy those down        203    00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.120    in collections they called floralegia        204    00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.200    a word that means something like flower        205    00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.320    garden        206    00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.800    a collection of the flowers or the        207    00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.080    fruits of their reading        208    00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.160    sometimes they would sort these portions        209    00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.399    of texts into further collections        210    00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:33.200    thematically arranged around themes like        211    00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.360    friendship or justice or prayer        212    00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.760    these collections weren't inert        213    00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.399    collections of sentences though they        214    00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:45.360    were meant to be read and re-read in        215    00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.320    order to change the reader        216    00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.560    to change how they moved through the        217    00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.839    world        218    00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:55.120    how they related to others        219    00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.240    it's an active way of reading        220    00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.959    a way of creating fluidity        221    00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:02.560    between reading        222    00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.079    writing and living        223    00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:08.000    not only is the reader meant to be        224    00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.240    changed by reading and re-reading        225    00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.760    fluorolegia        226    00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.160    but the texts themselves are changed        227    00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.880    a sentence from one text is placed next        228    00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.760    to the portion of another text and a new        229    00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.000    text is made        230    00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.640    one that speaks from the resonance or        231    00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.160    the friction between them        232    00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.040    and from the generative encounter        233    00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.000    of one text with another        234    00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.440    something new        235    00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.160    might be said        236    00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.519    our ways of communicating        237    00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:46.720    often flatten out the possibility        238    00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.839    of this kind of generativity        239    00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:53.279    timothy snyder the historian of fascism        240    00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:56.079    writes in his book on tyranny        241    00:10:56.079 --> 00:10:57.920    that one of the practices we need to        242    00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.360    cultivate in order to resist        243    00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.240    totalitarianism        244    00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.519    is to learn to speak in fresh ways        245    00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:07.839    unique to ourselves        246    00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:12.399    even about slogans we agree with        247    00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:15.040    avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone        248    00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.600    else does he writes        249    00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.720    think up your own way of speaking        250    00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.279    even if only to convey the thing you        251    00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:26.800    think everyone is saying        252    00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.480    history has shown        253    00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.720    and continues to show        254    00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.120    that tyrants manipulate language by        255    00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.880    repeating the same phrases over and over        256    00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.200    and over        257    00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.000    to resist the collective trance this can        258    00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.560    induce snyder says        259    00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.519    we need more conceptual and linguistic        260    00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:48.720    freedom        261    00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.399    in how we express our convictions        262    00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:54.560    and one of the ways we can learn to do        263    00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.440    this he says is to read books        264    00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.680    now this is not because books have all        265    00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.680    the answers        266    00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.480    it's because our engagement with other        267    00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.600    people's words often helps us find our        268    00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.279    own        269    00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:13.920    my journals are the things i underline        270    00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.040    in books valeria louiselli's narrator        271    00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.639    writes        272    00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:21.120    if we were to go through all of our        273    00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.800    underlinings and marginalia over the        274    00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.519    past two and a half years        275    00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:30.160    i think a portrait of this time would        276    00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.079    take shape        277    00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:36.000    made out of the way our lives interacted        278    00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.600    with what we were reading        279    00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.440    last week i heard dean hempton in        280    00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.600    conversation with professor thomas and        281    00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.680    professor carrasco        282    00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.839    about dean hempton's gifford lectures        283    00:12:47.839 --> 00:12:50.720    and the writing of history        284    00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.760    david carrasco quoted carlos fuentes        285    00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.839    as saying that the unwritten part of the        286    00:12:55.839 --> 00:12:57.839    world is so much greater than the        287    00:12:57.839 --> 00:13:00.079    written part of the world        288    00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:02.160    and that is true        289    00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.800    if we want to offer a written account of        290    00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.440    even a small part of the world        291    00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.760    our understanding of what counts as        292    00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.800    writing        293    00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.920    will have to expand        294    00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.120    today thomas helped us with this        295    00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.680    when she described her experience in the        296    00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.800    archive        297    00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.440    as she researched her project on arson        298    00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.120    attacks against black churches        299    00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.200    professor thomas said        300    00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.000    that she wept in the archive        301    00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.920    as she read the accounts of the        302    00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.839    deliberate destruction        303    00:13:35.839 --> 00:13:38.560    of sacred places cherished by        304    00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.560    individuals and communities        305    00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.320    i think that weeping        306    00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.720    is another form of writing        307    00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.839    and another form of reading        308    00:13:49.839 --> 00:13:52.480    it's a form that makes visible the        309    00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.760    opening        310    00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.560    that reading and writing can engender        311    00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.360    in the christian contemplative tradition        312    00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.320    tears are often the first step on the        313    00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.720    path to prayer        314    00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.000    pray first for the gift of tears the        315    00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.560    fourth century desert monk of agrius        316    00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.560    ponticus writes        317    00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.959    so that by means of sorrow        318    00:14:16.959 --> 00:14:21.760    you may soften your native rudeness        319    00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.399    maisie lowe and patrick downs in their        320    00:14:24.399 --> 00:14:26.560    final project for our contemplative        321    00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.279    prayer seminar this semester        322    00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:32.160    worked with evagrius's exhortation to        323    00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.199    tears        324    00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:36.240    as a medieval preacher might have done        325    00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.199    that is to say they quoted avagrius and        326    00:14:39.199 --> 00:14:41.279    then they kept going        327    00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:44.399    following his words into our world        328    00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:48.399    and listening for their resonance here        329    00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:51.360    pray for the gift of tears they said in        330    00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.760    their video project        331    00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.920    by means of sorrow        332    00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.360    you soften your edges and open your        333    00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.199    heart        334    00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:03.600    this prepares you        335    00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.399    for witness        336    00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.120    when we set our fragments our        337    00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.839    underlinings our        338    00:15:10.839 --> 00:15:14.639    marginalia down next to each other        339    00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:17.920    a third thing is made        340    00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.160    a new possibility        341    00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.680    an opening for witness for action for        342    00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.800    critique        343    00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.639    for reverence        344    00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:29.680    an opening for new forms of living that        345    00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.279    honor the complexity of human life        346    00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:35.680    safeguard human dignity        347    00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.000    and bear witness to the multiple        348    00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.800    possibilities our humanity holds        349    00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.519    a character in virginia woolf's novel to        350    00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:47.199    the lighthouse        351    00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:50.320    describes the vocation of the artist        352    00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.440    as doing just this        353    00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.800    the artist she says is the lover        354    00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.839    whose work it is to take things that        355    00:15:59.839 --> 00:16:02.320    seem not to belong together and to put        356    00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.079    them together        357    00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:06.880    fashioning from disparate fragments what        358    00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.120    she called a globed compacted thing        359    00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.079    over which thought lingers        360    00:16:14.079 --> 00:16:17.680    and love plays        361    00:16:17.839 --> 00:16:21.519    when i think of the work we did together        362    00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:24.639    during the difficult years of your time        363    00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:26.720    at hds        364    00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.440    this is what i think of        365    00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.639    i think of the way you eagerly read from        366    00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:34.560    your zoom box        367    00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.600    the passages that had sparkled up at you        368    00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.000    from your reading        369    00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.800    i think of how we passed those words        370    00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.680    from hand to hand turning them in the        371    00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.320    light of each other's experience        372    00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.199    weighing them in relation to the world's        373    00:16:51.199 --> 00:16:52.320    sorrow        374    00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.440    using other bits of text to interpret        375    00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.079    them further        376    00:16:58.079 --> 00:17:00.399    creating from fragments        377    00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:02.000    new histories        378    00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.680    new images        379    00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.280    new music        380    00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.120    new ideas        381    00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.439    new accounts of what we have lived        382    00:17:09.439 --> 00:17:10.959    through        383    00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:14.799    in ways that attract both thought        384    00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:17.439    and love        385    00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.640    and that's what you have done today        386    00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.319    and that's what this        387    00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:24.799    service does each year        388    00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:27.520    everyone brings their prayer their song        389    00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.640    their drums their sacred text their poem        390    00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.440    their blessing their speech        391    00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.840    and puts it down next to everybody        392    00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.840    else's        393    00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.440    these fragments        394    00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.280    don't compete        395    00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.240    or cancel each other out        396    00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.240    even when they describe utterly        397    00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.559    different world views even when they        398    00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:51.840    disagree about reality        399    00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.280    these fragments speak to each other        400    00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.440    and to us        401    00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.520    they read us        402    00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.880    and comment on who we are        403    00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:06.240    and who we might become        404    00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.120    in the spaces between them        405    00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.360    may we all find a place        406    00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.600    to bear witness to what we have        407    00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.440    experienced        408    00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.200    a vantage point        409    00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.720    to see beyond the way things are        410    00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.640    and companions        411    00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.480    with whom to work

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.960    the way i see it anyone who is a        29    00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.320    graduation speaker has two jobs        30    00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.680    keep it short which i can do        31    00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.439    the other job is to try to give some        32    00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.200    advice that might be helpful along the        33    00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.600    way        34    00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.400    which i will try to do here is a quick        35    00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.880    version        36    00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.000    of my advice have courage        37    00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.080    and here is the slightly longer version        38    00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.720    i spent most of my grown-up life in the        39    00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.560    classroom as sarah said        40    00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.360    first as a special education teacher and        41    00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.960    then as a law professor        42    00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.479    now i loved it i truly        43    00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.280    loved it helping students discover what        44    00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.680    they can do and watching as they spread        45    00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.759    their wings and learn to fly        46    00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.479    is thrilling and that's true whether        47    00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.119    you're teaching        48    00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.799    four-year-olds or teaching 24 year olds        49    00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.240    i never wanted to leave teaching in fact        50    00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.600    i would still be there with you walking        51    00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.520    into contracts class on the first day        52    00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.280    putting my books down looking up and        53    00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.240    saying        54    00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.479    what is a subset mr kennedy        55    00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.439    but i'm not doing that and this is what        56    00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.000    i wanted to        57    00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.280    talk to you about today i want to talk        58    00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.280    about my hope that you will be carried        59    00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.800    to an unexpected place a place        60    00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.760    where you will find work that you love        61    00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.800    work that gives you        62    00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.239    purpose and just possibly work        63    00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.840    that makes the world a better place so        64    00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.400    just for a minute let's talk about that        65    00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.160    bigger world        66    00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.840    for the last four years we have all        67    00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.000    witnessed something we never imagined we        68    00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.200    would see        69    00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.840    an ugliness spread that threatened and        70    00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.120    still threatens        71    00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.040    to consume us all now in reality        72    00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.360    the seeds of that ugliness were planted        73    00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.120    generations ago        74    00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.840    carefully watered and nourished and        75    00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.640    growing        76    00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.000    ever since massively widening        77    00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.280    income and wealth inequality growing        78    00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.879    corporate power        79    00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.840    hollowing out the middle class shredding        80    00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.400    a social safety net that was already too        81    00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.360    thin        82    00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.239    restricting even reversing the gains of        83    00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.319    the civil rights era        84    00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.319    refusing even to acknowledge the        85    00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.800    existence of structural racism        86    00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.680    entrenching a badly broken criminal        87    00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.800    justice system        88    00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.840    accelerating the climate crisis        89    00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.120    and with the demand for loyalty to the        90    00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.840    big lie        91    00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.319    undermining democracy itself        92    00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.360    yeah it's a grim list to talk about on        93    00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.879    graduation day        94    00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.519    but this list is why the world needs you        95    00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.959    so what should you do for some        96    00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.319    perhaps many of you what you do        97    00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.599    is already set many of you will join        98    00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.040    large law firms or        99    00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.360    businesses and in all likelihood you        100    00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.799    will prosper        101    00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.239    but graduations are about dreaming big        102    00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.239    so let me suggest something different        103    00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.439    something that        104    00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:10.480    requires courage step off the path        105    00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.439    so let me tell you a secret i take        106    00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:14.319    pleasure        107    00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.400    in the successes of all of my students        108    00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.199    well at least most of them uh there are        109    00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.040    a few exceptions        110    00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.280    but the students of whom i have been the        111    00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.560    proudest        112    00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.040    are those who have had the courage to        113    00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.560    take risks        114    00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.360    and try something that is truly        115    00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.280    consequential        116    00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.479    the reason is simple what you        117    00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.680    do matters a law degree        118    00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.880    particularly this law degree is a        119    00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.000    powerful tool how you use it        120    00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.720    is up to you you may choose to use it        121    00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.120    quite        122    00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.280    profitably helping clients who are        123    00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.800    already rich and powerful        124    00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.199    get richer and more powerful it is your        125    00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.000    life        126    00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.440    and your choices but my own advice        127    00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.639    is to respectfully ask you to consider        128    00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.919    other paths where the need is great i        129    00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.759    ask you to consider other paths        130    00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.639    precisely because        131    00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.160    you have so much to offer        132    00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.840    armed with nothing more than a law        133    00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.400    degree and not a harvard law degree        134    00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.800    i became a teacher a researcher an        135    00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.520    advocate        136    00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.160    an expert witness and author of amicus        137    00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.000    briefs and books        138    00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.240    a statute drafter and assistant to the        139    00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.919    president of the united states charged        140    00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.400    with setting up a consumer agency        141    00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.199    a senator and a candidate for president        142    00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:38.800    now i'm not

00:05:46.800    about all that is possible my list        146    00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.560    is small compared with all that is open        147    00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.080    to you        148    00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.240    and here is where courage comes in        149    00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.319    i know that you worked hard and planned        150    00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.479    hard to make it to law school        151    00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.160    i know that many of you didn't grow up        152    00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.479    with expectations of coming to a place        153    00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:05.520    like harvard        154    00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.759    as a first in my family to graduate from        155    00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:09.919    college i know that taking on something        156    00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:10.720    like this        157    00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.520    was hard i know that many of you came to        158    00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.720    law school through        159    00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.280    non-traditional paths and as someone who        160    00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.960    was married had a baby and a mortgage        161    00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.080    before i started law        162    00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.720    school i know what non-traditional feels        163    00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.479    like too        164    00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:27.919    i also know that like me all of you        165    00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:30.160    every single one of you counted the        166    00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.400    months the weeks the days        167    00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.199    until you would arrive at this        168    00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:36.560    graduation        169    00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.680    and i know that now most of you already        170    00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.199    have jobs lined up        171    00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:43.840    and for many of you the future looks        172    00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.800    predictable        173    00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.600    and secure and that it feels like a        174    00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.479    reward        175    00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:52.240    for all of the effort that you've put in        176    00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.800    even so i urge you to consider        177    00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.440    leaving that behind i urge you to        178    00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.240    consider        179    00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.520    a life that is open to public service        180    00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.160    open to taking on the troubles that are        181    00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.280    bearing down        182    00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.280    on us open to tackling the crises        183    00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.199    that are still in the making and we        184    00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.520    don't even see yet        185    00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.720    it takes courage real courage        186    00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.599    to step off the path that you have laid        187    00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:21.919    out        188    00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:25.440    for yourself there are so many paths out        189    00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.120    of law school that are steady        190    00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.039    dependable and not scary law firms        191    00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:34.479    will pave a road from here to a fancy        192    00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:36.319    office in a fancy building        193    00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:39.840    in a fancy city businesses will line up        194    00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.520    for your talents        195    00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.520    judges will offer clerkships that will        196    00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.639    let you delay        197    00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:48.240    real life for another year or two        198    00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.599    but think about doing something scary        199    00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:53.840    think about striking off on your own        200    00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.800    think about not        201    00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.759    following the expected path think about        202    00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:00.160    government service or non-profits or        203    00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.680    ngos        204    00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.479    think about taking a chance trying        205    00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:05.039    something        206    00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:08.479    different trying something big        207    00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:12.319    have courage take a risk because our        208    00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:17.280    nation and our world needs you        209    00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.560    and have courage for another reason        210    00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.840    because and here's the amazing part        211    00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.879    for all that you give you will receive        212    00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:30.000    far more for this point i'll tell you        213    00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.759    one last secret        214    00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:34.320    i stepped off the path nearly 10 years        215    00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.159    ago as sarah said        216    00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.479    i gave up the classroom and the students        217    00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:41.279    and climbed into the political pit        218    00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:44.800    for which i was unprepared but no matter        219    00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.360    how many times i wondered how i had        220    00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.399    gotten myself        221    00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:52.160    into this every single day        222    00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.360    no matter what i've awakened in the        223    00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.560    morning        224    00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.279    thinking about what i will get to do        225    00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:00.240    today        226    00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.560    not have to do get to do        227    00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.560    and that's been true on the days that        228    00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.200    i've won and it's been true        229    00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.320    on the days that i've lost because every        230    00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.200    day        231    00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.279    i've known that the work i do matters        232    00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:19.040    creating more opportunity for other        233    00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.120    people matters        234    00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.120    fighting to right wrongs and demand        235    00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.000    accountability on behalf of other people        236    00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.680    matters combating climate change        237    00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.279    matters tearing down systemic racism        238    00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:37.839    matters battling to save our democracy        239    00:09:37.839 --> 00:09:40.959    matters and no i haven't solved every        240    00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:42.480    problem i've encountered        241    00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.600    and i've made mistakes but i have stayed        242    00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.560    after it        243    00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.320    every day persistently        244    00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.600    and i've awakened every single day ready        245    00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.279    to go back into the fight        246    00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:58.800    that i believe in and it's been worth it        247    00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.200    every single day so when the day comes        248    00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.760    5 or 10 or 20 years from now when you're        249    00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.399    getting together with your classmates        250    00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.480    or when that moment comes late at night        251    00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.040    that steals upon you and you wonder        252    00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.120    about how you've spent your professional        253    00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.399    life        254    00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:19.680    i guarantee that you will smile a        255    00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.560    deep down smile over the parts of your        256    00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.440    life        257    00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.800    that you have spent in service to others        258    00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.399    so that's my advice have courage        259    00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:33.839    courage because life is fragile        260    00:10:33.839 --> 00:10:37.040    courage because our nation and our world        261    00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.760    need you courage because you will live        262    00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.440    a richer life make your families proud        263    00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.519    your community is proud your teacher is        264    00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:49.120    proud        265    00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.880    but most importantly make yourself proud        266    00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.320    and choose courage i know you can        267    00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.839    and i wish you well        268

challenges it emboldens you        356    00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.960    to do things not because they are easy        357    00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.160    but because they are difficult it        358    00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.280    teaches        359    00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.360    the value of perseverance        360    00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.520    to paraphrase president theodore        361    00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.280    roosevelt        362    00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.480    strive to do the deed so that        363    00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.520    in the end

 and at the worst if you fail while        367    00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.400    daring greatly        368    00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.600    you know that your place shall never be        369    00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.960    with those cold and timid souls who know        370    00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.480    neither victory        371    00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.520    nor defeat we

00:20:03.919 --> 00:20:06.000    simple problems        375    00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.240    but the more challenging ones too        376    00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.280    as a new dean i've had the advantage        377    00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.280    these last few months        378    00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.240    of speaking with many hundreds of        379    00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.679    individuals        380    00:20:19.679 --> 00:20:23.840    students faculty staff and alumni        381    00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.440    the observations and reflections i heard        382    00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.240    offer deep insights into the context in        383    00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.039    which        384    00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:34.880    you will be called to lead as you finish        385    00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.679    your time at harvard business school        386    00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:40.080    and begin new and exciting chapters in        387    00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.600    your lives        388    00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.960    i want to share some thoughts        389    00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.200    about why imagination inclusivity        390    00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.720    and innovation will be the keys        391    00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.520    to contributing to the world you will        392    00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.080    encounter        393    00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.760    imagination is the ability        394    00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.960    to look beyond what is        395    00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.880    to what might be it allows you to        396    00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.080    visualize the        397    00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.200    impossible as possible        398    00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.640    it challenges you to envision a world        399    00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.480    that you never believed you would see        400    00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:25.520    it inspires you to dare greatly        401    00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.640    it will take imagination to develop        402    00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.720    business solutions to society's problems        403    00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.320    in some ways this is not new        404    00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.480    business has been an engine of        405    00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.440    prosperity        406    00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.880    in economies around the globe        407    00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.320    lifting millions out of poverty        408    00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.440    and bringing vital services and products        409    00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.880    to people        410    00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.760    in ways that have transformed their        411    00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.240    standard of living        412    00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.320    but the financial crisis more than a        413    00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.000    decade ago        414    00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.919    and the pandemic today have exposed        415    00:22:03.919 --> 00:22:07.360    troubling divides the gap        416    00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:11.840    between rich and poor has accelerated        417    00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.600    too many individuals still lack access        418    00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.799    to education or health care and        419    00:22:18.799 --> 00:22:22.880    too many live paycheck to paycheck        420    00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.000    creating catastrophic consequences        421    00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.799    when disruption occurs as one example        422    00:22:30.799 --> 00:22:34.159    by some estimates more than 15 million        423    00:22:34.159 --> 00:22:35.919    people in the u.s        424    00:22:35.919 --> 00:22:39.120    faced food insecurity as a result of        425    00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.799    kovid        426    00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:44.400    many of them children        427    00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.760    additionally we are witnessing seismic        428    00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.480    shifts        429    00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.520    as a result of climate change with clean        430    00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.520    air and clean water becoming more        431    00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.960    elusive        432    00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.919    and a decline in biodiversity that will        433    00:22:57.919 --> 00:22:58.240    have        434    00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.520    long-term consequences        435    00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.640    my colleague rebecca henderson urges us        436    00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.280    to reimagine capitalism        437    00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.559    so that it is more just and sustainable        438    00:23:10.559 --> 00:23:13.600    and i heard her plea report        439    00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.320    repeated across my many conversations        440    00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.440    today the imperative is not just        441    00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.039    moral and not just social        442    00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:29.120    it is an economic imperative too        443    00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.799    business must take the lead in devising        444    00:23:32.799 --> 00:23:34.080    solutions        445    00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.080    to environmental social and governance        446    00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:42.080    challenges i am deeply inspired by        447    00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.520    examples        448    00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.760    like our new venture competition winners        449    00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.200    this year        450    00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.200    which included a design tech startup        451    00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.919    that makes 100 zero waste clothing        452    00:23:55.919 --> 00:23:59.120    and a data science powered platform        453    00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.880    that will provide simplified affordable        454    00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:07.120    quality health care to filipino workers        455    00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.400    bring the best design thinking you can        456    00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.440    to the problems you see        457    00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:17.360    and channel your inner john lennon        458    00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.000    and remember the lyrics from his song        459    00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.039    imagine        460    00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:24.240    which asserts it's easy        461    00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.440    if you try and it isn't        462    00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.400    hard to do        463    00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.919    the second leadership quality i want to        464    00:24:33.919 --> 00:24:34.880    share with you        465    00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.120    is inclusivity inclusivity means        466    00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.880    putting yourself in others shoes        467    00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.480    to learn about them and what drives them        468    00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.679    including the opportunities they see        469    00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:53.440    and the obstacles they face you can't be        470    00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.600    a fully effective leader        471    00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.320    if you surround yourself with others who        472    00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.600    look and think        473    00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.360    just like you do you need people        474    00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.760    who think differently from the way you        475    00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.720    do        476    00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.520    so you can benefit from multiple        477    00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.559    conflicting        478    00:25:10.559 --> 00:25:14.799    perspectives ultimately        479    00:25:14.799 --> 00:25:18.080    successful managers will be those who        480    00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.240    create the conditions        481    00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.360    where individuals in their organization        482    00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.640    can be and bring their best self        483    00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.240    to their work and successful companies        484    00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.600    will be those        485    00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.200    who understand deeply their full range        486    00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.559    of customers        487    00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:39.679    and their needs diversity of        488    00:25:39.679 --> 00:25:43.440    thought and experience often requires        489    00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.279    hiring a workforce        490    00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:48.880    that is diverse across for example        491    00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.080    gender race ethnicity age        492    00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.360    and religion managing across this        493    00:25:55.360 -->

00:00:10.250    At five years old, it was    a start of a new life,        4    00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.853    with new friends, new routines, a new me.        5    00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.470    After picking out the perfect    first day of school outfit,        6    00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.030    I was out the door with a    belly full of arepa con queso        7    00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.453    and a blue butterfly    clip holding my wet hair.        8    00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.590    My little body exuded    confidence on my way to school.        9    00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.820    Each stride, more fierce than the last,        10    00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.653    I felt larger than life.        11    00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.930    The door to my classroom swung open,        12    00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.530    I caught a glimpse of dozens of other kids        13    00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.330    some still eating breakfast        14    00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.510    on their freshly laminated placemats        15    00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.230    and others all ready    claiming their cubbies        16    00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.683    on the top shelf.        17    00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.810    After setting my bag on the floor,        18    00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.665    my mother kissed me goodbye and said,        19    00:00:59.665 --> 00:01:03.582    (speaking in foreign language)        20    00:01:04.912 --> 00:01:08.412    This is the beginning of a new experience.        21    00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.793    My stomach dropped.        22    00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.710    Before she could take another    step towards the door,        23    00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.480    I was at my mother's feet,        24    00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.270    legs and arms wrapped like    a sloth around her leg        25    00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.543    and tears streaming down    my face like a water slide.        26    00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.240    The thought of having to    confront this new world        27    00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.223    on my own was terrifying.        28    00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.660    For the last few months,        29    00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.820    we've all been told that we're    heading towards a new normal        30    00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.890    and it makes sense.        31    00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.720    After a virus claims the lives        32    00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.420    of almost 3 million human    beings around the world,        33    00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.560    there is no way to go back to the life        34    00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.533    that we were living    before January of 2020.        35    00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:56.380    But COVID-19 is not the only virus        36    00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.393    that has claimed the lives    of people in the last year.        37    00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.040    We have watched as a    failed healthcare system        38    00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.610    has compromised the lives        39    00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.130    of those in the unhoused community,        40    00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.760    the undocumented community,    the low income community,        41    00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.980    and every other human    being who has been denied        42    00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.593    equal access to healthcare    in a time of crisis.        43    00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.350    We've been witnessed to    the murders of black people        44    00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.290    at the hands of those    sworn to protect them,        45    00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.630    murders that have been normalized        46    00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.603    and justified for generations.        47    00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.550    We've been witnessed to the    murders of Asian-Americans        48    00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.500    as a result of divisive    political leadership        49    00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.150    that I've used their platform        50    00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.983    to spew hateful and dangerous propaganda.        51    00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.360    White supremacy has added fuel to the fire        52    00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.883    that had already given    us so much to mourn,        53    00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.573    racism, xenophobia, classism.        54    00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.560    As a collective, we have come face-to-face        55    00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.690    with the aspect of our    society where we are lacking,        56    00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.623    where we need to learn from    one another and be better.        57    00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.653    This last year has also shown    us where our strengths lie.        58    00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.170    Often times we'll find    that our communities        59    00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.393    are the source of these strengths.        60    00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.460    Last March, as the news    of an online semester        61    00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.860    created unimaginable    chaos in everyone's life.        62    00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.850    We low income students were faced        63    00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.050    with unique struggles and barriers        64    00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.123    as we navigated the unknown.        65    00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.500    The first-generation community stepped up        66    00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.920    to provide emotional and    financial support to its members.        67    00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.920    Despite our different realities,        68    00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.593    we were there for one another.        69    00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.460    A Harvard degree comes with a    high level of responsibility.        70    00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.580    Our communities look to us    as leaders and change makers.        71    00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.600    Once we figured if we    leave the Harvard yard        72    00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.890    that has been home to tears, laughter,        73    00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.150    and memories that we will never forget,        74    00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.760    the honors will be on us,        75    00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.760    the class of 2021 to lead the    change towards a new normal.        76    00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.500    The generations to come    will be looking up to us        77    00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.580    as we put out fires and lay the foundation        78    00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.163    of a world that they will    be proud to be a part of.        79    00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.080    When I'm imagine this day,        80    00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.540    I pictured tens of thousands of people        81    00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.070    all crammed into Tercentenary Theater,        82    00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.370    a place that has been home to memories        83    00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.053    that have adorned and defined    our Harvard experience.        84    00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.600    I pictured myself marching    all the way from Mather house        85    00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.120    into the yard that once    welcomed a doe-eyed first year        86    00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.530    trying to find her way    to Wigglesworth Hall,        87    00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.890    recalling another late night in Lamont        88    00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.683    and early morning and    Widener with every step.        89    00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.060    Most importantly, I pictured myself        90    00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.200    presenting my cap and gown to my parents        91    00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.520    and my brother as a way to    thank them for their support,        92    00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.913    their sacrifices, and their    unwavering belief in me.        93    00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.650    While the reality of    what this day looks like        94    00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.390    is in stark contrast to    what we may have dreamt of,        95    00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.530    let us be thankful for the people        96    00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.220    and experiences that have brought us here        97    00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.783    and the memories that we have created.        98    00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.800    My mother still shares the story        99    00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.740    of the first day of kindergarten        100    00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.543    where she had a sloth    wrapped around her leg.        101    00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.440    Each time I reach a new    milestone in my life        102    00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.570    she'll tie it back to that day        103    00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.820    as an attempt to put my    fears into perspective,        104    00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.223    and to emphasize how far I have come.        105    00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:04.418    (speaking in foreign language)        106    00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:11.950    No matter how scared    you are in the moment,        107    00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.893    you overcome your fears    and you keep pushing.        108    00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.300    As we embark on this unpredictable journey        109    00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.800    of life after Harvard in the    middle of a worldwide crisis,        110    00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.103    I encourage you all to keep    this quotation with you.        111    00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.860    It is a large and crucial tasks        112    00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.550    that we have on our hands,        113    00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.990    to dismantle the systems of oppression        114    00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.000    that have taken too much from our people        115    00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.553    and too much from our communities.        116    00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.270    And while we may want to wrap our arms        117    00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.910    around the familiarity    of our dining halls,        118    00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.840    our houses, and one another,        119    00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.610    it is our time to go out into the world        120    00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.680    and build something that we are proud of,        121    00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.290    a world where we uplift the voices        122    00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.000    of those who have been    silenced for too long,        123    00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.450    and empower those who have    been pushed into the shadows.        124    00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:13.323    It is our time to create a new normal.

   00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.660    - Greetings from Massachusetts Hall.        2    00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.500    This is where I used to come to work.        3    00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.140    I actually haven't done that        4    00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.363    for 440 days now and    counting, but who's counting?        5    00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.260    This building, the oldest on campus,        6    00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.983    has been part of the yard since 1720.        7    00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.430    If it could talk, it would tell tales        8    00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.270    of George Washington and the troops        9    00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.480    he quartered here during    the Revolutionary War.        10    00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.370    Tales of John Adams hurrying    in and out as a young man,        11    00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.080    carefully scribbling the    day's weather in his diary.        12    00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.620    Tales of the handful of you        13    00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.623    who called its fourth floor    home as first-year students,        14    00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.340    This building is a testament    to the strength and resilience        15    00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.745    of Harvard and its people.        16    00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:50.970    Brick by beautiful brick,    it was built by individuals        17    00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.600    who did not yet dream of    United States of America.        18    00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.850    People who could not yet    dream of the university,        19    00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.300    into which you entered as students,        20    00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.520    from across the country    and across the world,        21    00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.160    with circumstances and    experiences as varied        22    00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.430    as your extraordinary achievements.        23    00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.270    Welcome members of the    Harvard Class of 2021,        24    00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.893    and congratulations.        25    00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.000    You're on the brink of    joining one of the world's        26    00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.810    most accomplished communities of alumni.        27    00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.000    The community that for nearly 400 years,        28    00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.720    has connected the age that is past        29    00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.353    to the age that is waiting before.        30    00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.550    That line from our alma mater,        31    00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.700    puts the vexing present        32    00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.620    into a more welcome context.        33    00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.823    This too shall pass.        34    00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.750    A global pandemic has    kept us apart this year,        35    00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.450    but we've learned together,    we've grown together,        36    00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.980    and we have overcome together.        37    00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.210    I've never seen such    grit, such determination,        38    00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.883    and I have never, ever been    prouder of this institution.        39    00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.090    So while this is not    the moment you imagined        40    00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.890    when you began your course of study,        41    00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.540    take a moment to appreciate    all that this age        42    00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.470    has actually given you.        43    00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.900    No commencement tickets,    everyone could come.        44    00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.900    No parking drama, and let's    face it, 0% chance of rain,        45    00:02:28.906 --> 00:02:31.740    Front row seats for everyone you love        46    00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.323    and everyone who loves you,        47    00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.350    and well-deserved hoots    and hugs and hollers        48    00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.323    and high-fives as your    degree is actually conferred.        49    00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.890    One day, you will celebrate    your graduation on campus        50    00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.610    with classmates and    friends in familiar places.        51    00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.480    And that day cannot come soon enough.        52    00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.520    For now however, delight in the company        53    00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.130    of those who've cheered    you on and cheered you up.        54    00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.950    Those who've urged determination        55    00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.640    in the face of disenchantment.        56    00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.010    Those who've supplanted    languish with levity,        57    00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.630    with hope, with joy.        58    00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.140    Those who have sacrificed so much        59    00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.853    so you can be here.        60    00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.310    One of a number of things that is unusual        61    00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.580    about this celebration,        62    00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.530    is that many of you are actually        63    00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.070    sitting right now next to    your families and loved ones.        64    00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.130    People who have in some cases        65    00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.560    become your unexpected suite-mates        66    00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.373    over the course of this past year.        67    00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.790    No one accomplishes anything    in life on his or her own.        68    00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.190    Your loved ones have    nurtured and supported you        69    00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.363    on this journey that    has led you to this day.        70    00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.220    I want you to actually take    a minute now and thank them,        71    00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.710    for all that they've done    to get you to this moment.        72    00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.430    Go ahead, give them a hug of thanks.        73    00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.060    They deserve it.        74    00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.443    And now we'll pause while you do that.        75    00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.170    I hope you will delight too        76    00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.990    in the colossal feat of your arrival.        77    00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.130    Consider the days, the months,        78    00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.580    the years of relentless effort,        79    00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.280    in some cases of stunning failure,        80    00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.590    but also thrilling triumph.        81    00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.550    Consider what you sacrificed    and what you gained.        82    00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.270    Consider who you were when you got here,        83    00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.120    and who you are now as you leave.        84    00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.890    When it was that you most grew    in knowledge and in wisdom,        85    00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.443    and where you will go from here.        86    00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.350    This moment is meant for you    and will be yours forever.        87    00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.840    Fair Harvard welcomes you at    last into her storied company.        88    00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.290    And I send you into a new age        89    00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.260    on the wings of wishes,        90    00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.280    born from familiar lyrics.        91    00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.040    May you think freely and bear patiently        92    00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.510    those who think differently.        93    00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.280    May you quicken the currents        94    00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.110    of truth in every field and discipline,        95    00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.930    and hasten the world to better days.        96    00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.660    May your destinies like    our beloved universities        97    00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.860    be onward and bright.        98    00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.860    Congratulations members of the

his time at    Harvard, Russell Simons        4    00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.360    worked as a public health    fellow in the Office        5    00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.390    of Massachusetts State    Senator, Joe Comerford,        6    00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.080    drafting legislation to promote    racial and health equity        7    00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.200    and policy making across    the state government.        8    00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.660    Russell grew up in    Larchmont, New York.        9    00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.520    He received his    Bachelor of Science        10    00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.060    in biology, Magna cum    laude, from Boston College        11    00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.960    as a Gabelli    Presidential Scholar.        12    00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.880    He previously worked    as a researcher        13    00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.610    at the Human Rights Watch,    where he investigated        14    00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.340    human rights concerns related    to the opioid epidemic,        15    00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.150    the development of universal    health coverage systems,        16    00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.430    and HIV/AIDS care for    transgender women.        17    00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.820    Russell is finishing his M.D.    at the University of Chicago        18    00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.240    and pursuing a residency    in general surgery.        19    00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.820    He is fiercely    passionate about fighting        20    00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.770    health inequity in all forms    and promoting social justice.        21    00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.680    Russell intends to use his    training in medicine and public        22    00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.320    health to make a meaningful    difference in his patients'        23    00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.180    lives and to play an influential    role in US policy making.

Dean Kim, esteemed        27    00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.310    members of the    faculty, and members        28    00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.930    of the classes of 2020 and    2021, my name is Russell Simons.        29    00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.540    I'm an MPH graduate    of the class of 2020.        30    00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.550    And as of yesterday,    I'm officially        31    00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.110    a doctor of medicine as well.        32    00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.477    [AUDIENCE APPLAUDS]        33    00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.590    Despite the craziness    of the last 24 hours,        34    00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.040    I am so happy to be    here with all of you.        35    00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.240    If you remember, it was almost    one year ago or for some two,        36    00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.230    that we tuned into our virtual    commencement exercises.        37    00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.530    Now that we're all here    gathered for graduation 2.0,        38    00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.020    I think this officially    makes us the only two        39    00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.800    classes in Harvard's    386-year history        40    00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.000    to graduate twice from    the exact same program.        41    00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.288    [AUDIENCE APPLAUDS]        42    00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.350    In preparation for this    historic graduation,        43    00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.620    I reflected on the remarks I    delivered a year ago titled,        44    00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.860    ""Politics are Public Health,    Social Change is Medicine.""        45    00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.250    I think regrettably, that    message is just as relevant        46    00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.700    today as it was last year,    as our nation continues        47    00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.780    to find new and devastating    ways to politicize the public's        48    00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.470    health.        49    00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.160    As I try to find my own role    amid the seemingly unending        50    00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.580    chaos, I'm reminded of    their most important change        51    00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.480    in my own thinking over    the past few years.        52    00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.265    Let me explain.        53    00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.910    I've always thought    of the serenity prayer        54    00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.990    as a sort of guiding    framework for my life.        55    00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.190    For those not familiar    with it, it goes, ""God,        56    00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.340    grant me the serenity to accept    the things I cannot change,        57    00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.580    the courage to change    the things I can,        58    00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.960    and the wisdom to    the difference.""        59    00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.910    Over the years, I've    realized it's not        60    00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.920    all that easy to act on.        61    00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.560    I've often doubted    whether I'd be wise enough        62    00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.260    to recognize what I can    make better in this world,        63    00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.820    and whether I would have    the courage to make it so.        64    00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.460    Prior to starting at Harvard, I    spent the preceding three years        65    00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.090    as a medical student on    Chicago's South Side,        66    00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.840    where I helped care    for dozens of patients        67    00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.120    who, as best I    could tell, it had        68    00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.100    been sickened by the    society in which we live.        69    00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.280    Patients are often    labeled as complex        70    00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.110    because their social    needs outstrip what        71    00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.510    we as caregivers could offer.        72    00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.220    I went home a lot    of days feeling        73    00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.130    powerless to change the    circumstances of my patients'        74    00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.150    lives, even though it was    the social determinants        75    00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.580    that it propelled them to    the hospital's doorstep        76    00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.440    with the momentum of    a crude injustice.        77    00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.860    I imagine most of us can think    of a job or personal experience        78    00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.769    that showed us the need for    a more equitable and just        79    00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.820    society, pushing us in the    direction of Public Health.        80    00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.902    Unfortunately, there is    no pill for injustice.        81    00:04:29.902 --> 00:04:31.610    And the medical    textbooks I was studying,        82    00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.580    didn't talk much about politics,    poverty, or structural racism.        83    00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.640    And yet I kept asking myself,    if these are the things that        84    00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.060    are making my patients sick,    aren't they my responsibility        85    00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.920    to address too?        86    00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.270    Or, I wondered, is    this where I should        87    00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.180    be asking for the serenity    to accept the things        88    00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.975    I can't change?        89    00:04:57.692 --> 00:04:59.150    Whether I ultimately    decided it was        90    00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.980    my responsibility out of wisdom    or idealism, I'm not sure.        91    00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.625    But it was the sense    of responsibility        92    00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:08.000    and the recognition    that I wasn't        93    00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.298    equipped to make good on it    that ultimately brought me here.        94    00:05:12.298 --> 00:05:14.090    Studying health policy    helped me appreciate        95    00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.630    how my vocations, as a physician    and public health practitioner        96    00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.300    could extend to the    political realm.        97    00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.377    Frankly, that they have to.        98    00:05:23.377 --> 00:05:24.960    And no matter your    background or where        99    00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.180    you've landed after    Harvard, I think        100    00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.560    the same can be said for all    of us gathered here today.        101    00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.020    As it turns out,    those of us working        102    00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.970    to improve the health    of people around us        103    00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.640    have a massive    advantage when it comes        104    00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.160    to engaging in    political systems.        105    00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.600    Put simply-- health opens doors    that are closed to others.        106    00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.420    When my role model    Dr. Jack Geiger,        107    00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.920    was building one of America's    first community health clinics        108    00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.740    in Mississippi in    the late 1960s,        109    00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.790    he noted that they were able    to quote, ""to enter and to do        110    00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.430    things under the umbrella of    health that would have been        111    00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.770    much harder to do if    they'd said they were there        112    00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.620    for economic development    or for social change.""        113    00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.700    I think there is so much    power in this realization,        114    00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.330    because it positions anyone that    strives for a healthier society        115    00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.320    as an agent of social change.        116    00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.260    It helped me realize that    caring about public health        117    00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.200    was already a    political act, that I        118    00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.450    could do even more by    leaning into the notions        119    00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.170    that politics and public health    are increasingly synonymous,        120    00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:35.350    and that social change is    its own form of medicine.        121    00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.290    Because having the serenity    to accept what I can't change        122    00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.610    is a luxury, in a time when a    pandemic entrenches centuries        123    00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.610    of health inequity, when    the constitutional right        124    00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.630    for a woman to govern her    own body is in question,        125    00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.660    and when lawmakers' willful    inaction on gun violence        126    00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.470    means shooting after shooting    in schools supermarkets,        127    00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.030    and sanctuaries.        128    00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.360    So now instead of reciting    the serenity prayer,        129    00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.460    I think we should all    look to a revision        130    00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.290    by Angela Davis for guidance.        131    00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.630    I am no longer accepting    the things I cannot change.        132    00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.555    I am changing the    things I cannot accept.        133    00:07:16.555 --> 00:07:19.906    [AUDIENCE APPLAUDS]        134    00:07:28.850 -->

   00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:02.370    PRESIDENT LARRY BACOW >>  Congratulations,        2    00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.319    members of the Harvard Class of 2020.        3    00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:07.099    Within the hour, you will finally take        4    00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.350    your place at the head of what Ralph Waldo    Emerson,        5    00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.469    Harvard Class of 1821,        6    00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.540    called that long winding train reaching back    into eternity,        7    00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.170    a procession of alumni who have helped to    improve the lot of        8    00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.380    humanity now for close to 400 years.        9    00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.010    I'm sure you've imagined this moment for quite    some time,        10    00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.189    but let's face it, it's far different than        11    00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.870    any of us could have predicted when this semester    began.        12    00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.130    But there are actually some upsides to this    kind of celebration.        13    00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:45.610    For example, everyone you love and everyone    who loves you can actually attend,        14    00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.320    no tickets are required.        15    00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.460    No scrambling for good seats in Harvard Yard    early this morning,        16    00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.980    and none of you had to worry about where you    were going to        17    00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.830    park on this most momentous of days.        18    00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.740    Those loved ones who've once again become        19    00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.149    your housemates and your roommates get to    give you a big hug,        20    00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.070    literally, as your degrees are conferred.        21    00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.490    Just think, you're the first class in        22    00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.340    the 384 year history of Harvard that can actually    say that,        23    00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.920    and I also can guarantee that there will be    no rain today.        24    00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.750    Two months of pandemic cannot be allowed to    overshadow your years of hard work,        25    00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.700    your many late nights and early mornings,        26    00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.600    your countless, personal pep talks,        27    00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.290    and let's face it, we all do them,        28    00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.950    that turn self-doubt into self-determination.        29    00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.700    Faced with obstacles, each of you mustered    your courage,        30    00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.880    set your sights and overcame the insurmountable.        31    00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.270    You expanded your understanding of who you    are and what you can do,        32    00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.329    and you discovered the truth about yourself,        33    00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:02.170    a veritas worth pursuing if there ever was    one.        34    00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.409    But you did not get to this moment in time    on your own.        35    00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.229    The people who were sitting with you today    in many cases,        36    00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.110    literally sacrificed so that you could be here.        37    00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.360    So I want you to take a moment and turn to    them now and say thank you.        38    00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.200    Thank you for helping to make you the people    that you are.        39    00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.560    Thank you for helping you to see this day    actually come to pass.        40    00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.480    Go ahead, take your time,        41    00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:41.390    give them a big hug and a kiss, they deserve    it.        42    00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.570    To all the parents, siblings,        43    00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.420    friends, and loved ones who are there with you,        44    00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.200    on behalf of all of us at Harvard,        45    00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.340    thank you for all you've done to help make    this day possible.        46    00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.420    Thank you for entrusting these remarkable    graduates to us.        47    00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.510    It's been our privilege to teach them,        48    00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.100    to get to know them,        49    00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.350    and also to learn from them.        50    00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.130    Their future is very bright and we are very    proud of them too.        51    00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.190    To the Class of 2020,        52    00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.030    today is about you.        53    00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.630    Celebrate your achievements, savor your successes,        54    00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.750    rest even for a day upon your laurels,        55    00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.480    but only for a day because tomorrow is about    everyone else.        56    00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.680    How will you use your gifts and        57    00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.110    your Harvard education to make the world a    better place for others?        58    00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.210    How will you help to ensure that others        59    00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.480    have opportunities similar to those that you've enjoyed?        60    00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.030    How will you create a future in which all    people are equipped        61    00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.580    to do their best work and to be their best selves.        62    00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.960    Humanity needs people who are willing to devote    themselves to asking questions,        63    00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.980    hard questions, sometimes even uncomfortable    questions.        64    00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.820    People who are willing to work hard to perfect    this imperfect world that we inhabit.        65    00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.900    People who care more about others than about    themselves.        66    00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.680    You are those people,        67    00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.489    and when we gather in person sometime later    to celebrate your graduation,        68    00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.099    when we have a chance to relish all the pomp and        69    00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:23.810    circumstance in one another's company that    we cannot do today,        70    00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.660    I will want to know how you are helping to    improve the lot of        71    00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.840    humanity, where you've been and where you    think you're going.        72    00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.449    Harvard, as it turns out,        73    00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.810    does not pull the long and winding train behind it.        74    00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.970    No, that long and winding train which you've    now joined,        75    00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.759    pushes Harvard and the entire world into the future.        76    00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:52.969    I look forward to the day when Emerson's vision    comes to life for us all,        77    00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.410    when we can all once again be together.        78    00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.600    Until then, congratulations to members of    the Class of 2020.        79    00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.930    We are so proud of each and every one of you.        80    00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.479    You have accomplished great things,        81    00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.770    and you're going to accomplish even more.        82    00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:17.020    Good luck to each and every one of you and    Godspeed.

   00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.330    MICHAEL PHILLIPS >>  Freshman year, when I was launched into another universe,        2    00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.170    my only grounding point was the gravitational    pull of a question,        3    00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.850    ""Will Harvard change me?""        4    00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.320    That question mingled with the heartfelt gifts    and the parting words of my parents.        5    00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.480    My mom was placing a set of keys around my neck,        6    00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.540    each key engraved with a word,        7    00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.680    believe, fearless and inspire.        8    00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.060    My dad said, ""I've always imagined life for    you like a canvas,        9    00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.080    and I hope to have had one big enough for    you to imagine new possibilities.        10    00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.920    I'm proud to see Harvard become your canvas.""        11    00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.609    Minutes later I walked into my dorm room,        12    00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:40.010    and on my desk I found a list of alumni that    held the keys to that room before me.        13    00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.629    The first name I read was Henry David Thoreau,        14    00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.559    the prophetic essayist and abolitionist.        15    00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.090    It was a glimpse into the greatness of what    the surreal world was capable of.        16    00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.609    ""Maybe,"" I thought, ""it just might change    me for the better.""        17    00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:56.160    Perhaps you had a similar experience on move-in day,        18    00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.489    but the chronicle of what we could become    predates that moment.        19    00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.429    When the class of 2020 was still scattered    across the world,        20    00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.110    our first connection came from a story that    we heard.        21    00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.520    From TV punchlines to political institutions,        22    00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.659    the name Harvard reverberated across the canyons    of culture with an infinite echo.        23    00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.360    It permeated the boundaries of class,        24    00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.979    Cree, country and continent.        25    00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.640    Like kids reading a bedtime story,        26    00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.840    we inserted ourselves into this narrative    arc of a galaxy of greatness.        27    00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.840    In 2016, we converted those dreams into        28    00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.520    essays and traded them for tickets to the    new frontier.        29    00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.450    We landed on campus eager to perform our own    superhuman feats,        30    00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.810    from pulling all-nighters in Lamar basement,        31    00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.890    to breaking the laws of the universe with    great inflation.        32    00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.030    The more we progress the more we pursue.        33    00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.750    Freshman year, we spent our energy writing        34    00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.829    viscerally scribbled applications to social lords.        35    00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:47.810    Sophomore year, we exchanged our space suits for        36    00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.979    business suits so we could rush to networking events.        37    00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.570    Though with every superhuman attempt,        38    00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.090    some shortcomings were revealed.        39    00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.520    By junior year, many of us remained        40    00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.740    agitated by the persistent presence of imposter syndrome.        41    00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.009    It felt like the incessant pain of a paper    cut or worse than that.        42    00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.450    The place that we had imagined as kids,        43    00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.500    a place defined by the pursuit of passion,    became troubled by the fear of rejection.        44    00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.150    Our community of collaboration converted to    one of crippling comparisons.        45    00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.290    Suddenly our aspirations to pursue progress,        46    00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.070    were limited by our desperation to preserve status.        47    00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.140    We began believing that our purpose lay in    our importance,        48    00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.190    but we forfeited our power.        49    00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.540    We saw our galaxy of greatness stripped of    the light of possibility,        50    00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.410    subdued by the darkness of self-doubt.        51    00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.640    At that confusing junction,        52    00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.820    many were asking themselves,        53    00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.530    ""Is this all I really came to Harvard to become?""        54    00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.810    But what if we open the door to a different reality?        55    00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.090    What if we already have the keys?        56    00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.070    The first key from my mom said ""Believe.""        57    00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.900    Could she have been asking us to believe        58    00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.090    that we never really came to Harvard to acquire accolades,        59    00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.810    but that success is second rate to soul saved    and lives made better.        60    00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.130    The second key said ""Fearless.""        61    00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.350    Did she know that the path to purpose might    be unpopular,        62    00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.020    but if we clung to that fear of rejection,        63    00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.290    we might fail to offer the world what was    ours to give?        64    00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.850    The last key said ""Inspire.""        65    00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.570    Might she have understood that if we did not    become leaders of sacrifice,        66    00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.590    we would become leaders of selfishness but    we would be leaders either way.        67    00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.430    When my dad said Harvard is your canvas,        68    00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.480    was he not giving us the confidence to emerge    from the college,        69    00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.650    and the Kennedy School,        70    00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.690    and the business school,     and the divinity school,        71    00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.690    and the design school,        72    00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.480    and the law school, the medical school,        73    00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.870    the education school, the extension school,    the dental school,        74    00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.450    and every other school at Harvard,        75    00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.870    painting portraits with our presence as a    community of artists        76    00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.860    and not imitators of key makers and not gatekeepers.        77    00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.560    As I stand here today,        78    00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.170    my answer to all of these questions is a resounding Yes.        79    00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.150    And if yours is too,        80    00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.610    then we can leave our galaxy of greatness    and land back on Earth        81    00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.519    with such an unyielding collision that the    paradigms of broken systems and        82    00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.769    mediocre standards might splatter like gas    and dust in a        83    00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.620    supernova.        84    00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.560    In the midst of this historic global    pandemic.        85    00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.169    This message carries more weight than it ever    has before.        86    00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.219    Use our powers for good.        87    00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:40.930    That by those deeds we might demonstrate that        88    00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.479    our gifts are not a solemn path to importance,        89    00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.990    but a promise for another person.        90    00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.280    Harvard will change you,        91    00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.370    but let it continue to change you.        92    00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.110    Let it make you keenly sensitive to injustice.        93    00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.879    Let it make you more empathetic to struggle.        94    00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:06.620    Let it embolden you to make change.        95    00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.009    Let it make you all of these things because    to become anything        96    00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:16.580    else would be to forfeit any meaning in being    a Harvard graduate.        97    00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.639    We were fortunate to fly high enough that    we might        98    00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:24.770    grab the moral arc of the universe itself.        99    00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.099    May we bend it in the right direction.

O. Wilson was seven,        2    00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.440    he got a fish bone stuck in his eyeball.        3    00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.530    After that, he couldn't see things far away,        4    00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.820    so he decided to look at small things closely.        5    00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.850    Gazing into a microscope,        6    00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.610    Ed fell in love with ants.        7    00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.840    After decades studying them,        8    00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.190    he explained that every species,        9    00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.770    even an ant, represents an evolutionary journey    of 3.9 billion years.        10    00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.899    That fish bone forced Ed to see the world    from a new perspective.        11    00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.870    Professor Wilson's story mirrors the phenomenon    he spent his life studying, evolution.        12    00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.649    I studied evolution in lab during my PhD.        13    00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.010    Evolution is driven by challenges causing    adaptations.        14    00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.479    Challenged with tall trees,        15    00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:56.420    giraffes evolved long necks.        16    00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.769    Challenged with hard seeds,        17    00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.589    birds evolved tough peaks.        18    00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.160    Through a series of environmental challenges,        19    00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:11.340    evolution transformed life from a wriggling    RNA molecule to a diverse human society.        20    00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.260    Outside my lab, I saw that challenges are        21    00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.940    the building blocks of not only biological    adaptations,        22    00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.450    but also personal evolution.        23    00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.800    I learned this from my grandfather, Dr. Abdul Raoof.        24    00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.109    His story began as an orphan in India, struggling    for food and shelter.        25    00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.280    In hopes of a scholarship,        26    00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.039    he studied under streetlights swarming with bugs.        27    00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:41.799    He finally won a scholarship to Columbia University    where he earned a PhD.        28    00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.880    He became a teacher of children,        29    00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.619    then a principal, then a teacher of teachers.        30    00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.579    My grandfather's mission evolved from early    challenges.        31    00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.179    Education gave him freedom,        32    00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.270    so he became an educator.        33    00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.590    Hungry in childhood, he provided food for    his students.        34    00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.049    Homeless in his village,        35    00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.360    he housed people under his own roof and dependent    on scholarships,        36    00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.100    he funded scholarships for students in need.        37    00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.330    In these ways, from so simple a beginning,        38    00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.360    my grandfather's life evolved a mission.        39    00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.510    Over 40 years, he built schools,        40    00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.040    developed curricula and trained teachers in    Bhutan,        41    00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.190    Afghanistan, Kenya ,and India.        42    00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.680    He retired as a director of UNESCO, having    educated thousands.        43    00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.920    He dedicated the last chapter of his life    to educating just two,        44    00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.600    my brother and me.        45    00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.790    It was not his Ivy League degree,        46    00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.580    but his experience at the bottom of society    that propelled him.        47    00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.790    My grandfather and Professor Wilson,        48    00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.440    teach us that our challenges help us develop    our strengths.        49    00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.330    What Professor Wilson lost in sight, he gained    in vision.        50    00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.890    My grandfather, powerless in youth,        51    00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.800    spent his life empowering others.        52    00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.720    Fellow graduates, 2020 has gotten off to a    very rough start.        53    00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.260    Illness, isolation, and insecurities weigh    on all of us.        54    00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.230    Coronavirus has also unmasked deep troubles    in our societies.        55    00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.770    Facing patients who couldn't breathe,        56    00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.280    we medical students had to share ventilators    and ration oxygen among them.        57    00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.160    Public health students witnessed the difficulty of        58    00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.790    mobilizing medical resources due to politics,        59    00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.980    inadequate planning, and inconsistent public education.        60    00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.370    Business students saw how brittle our economy    is when confronting crisis,        61    00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.300    especially for the most vulnerable among us;        62    00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.390    the hourly workers, the homeless, the forgotten.        63    00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.270    In times like these,        64    00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.030    we can remember that the greater the adversity,        65    00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.250    the greater the need for evolution on all    scales,        66    00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:05.740    from the individual to the nation and historic    times have inspired historic innovations.        67    00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.590    During the Great Plague,        68    00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.220    isolated in quarantine, Isaac Newton discovered    gravity,        69    00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.740    optical physics, and calculus.        70    00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.840    After World War II,        71    00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.900    in a Harvard commencement speech,        72    00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.370    George Marshall announced the Marshall Plan,        73    00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.870    lifting millions out of poverty.        74    00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.790    We are, once again, at a challenging moment.        75    00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.760    But let us remember that challenges inspire    evolution,        76    00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.910    and evolution that Harvard graduates can direct.        77    00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.370    We study the law,        78    00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.500    engineering, history, medicine, divinity.        79    00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.870    This pandemic has uncovered the world's needs.        80    00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.490    How can we adapt to serve our communities    or future generations?        81    00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.490    This is our opportunity to evolve ourselves    from        82    00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:00.130    students of arts and sciences to drivers of    social progress and innovation.        83    00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.510    My grandfather told me,        84    00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.190    ""Make a plan to change the world and do not    rest until you achieve it.""        85    00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.710    It's now, when we're at our lowest points,        86    00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.850    that we look internally,        87    00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.090    develop our strengths, and gain the vision        88    00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.900    that may lead us to our highest points in    the future.        89    00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.630    So graduates, let us turn this disruption    into        90    00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.490    our vision and this challenge into our evolution.

   00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.489    Good morning from my home.        2    00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:07.850    Like you, I wish we were together on campus.        3    00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.879    There's so much now we can no longer take    for granted.        4    00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.619    The air we breathe is first among them.        5    00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.970    So those of us who are healthy have ample    reason to be grateful.        6    00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.070    I'm also grateful to Harvard and to President    Bacow for inviting me to be with you.        7    00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.140    To the Harvard Class of 2020, congratulations,        8    00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.590    and congratulations to the parents, professors,        9    00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.750    mentors, and friends who helped you along    the way.        10    00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.050    Joining you for graduation is a high honor.        11    00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.559    For me this is an opportunity,        12    00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.170    an opportunity to speak about subjects that    I believe are of real urgency,        13    00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.550    especially now during a worldwide health emergency.        14    00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.699    I would like to discuss with you the need    for a commitment to facts and the truth.        15    00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:01.699    Only a few months ago,        16    00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.000    I would have settled for emphasizing that    our democracy depends on facts and truth,        17    00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.979    and it truly does.        18    00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.450    But now as we can plainly see,        19    00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.750    it is more elemental than that.        20    00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.570    Facts and truth are matters of life and death.        21    00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.930    Misinformation, disinformation, delusions,    and deceit can kill.        22    00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.890    Here is what can move us forward: science    and medicine,        23    00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.720    study and knowledge, expertise, and reason.        24    00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.040    In other words, fact and truth.        25    00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.790    I want to tell you why free expression by    all of us and an independent press,        26    00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.600    imperfect though we may be,        27    00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.380    is essential to getting at the truth,        28    00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.409    and why we must hold the government to account,        29    00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.729    and hold other powerful interests to account    as well.        30    00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.790    When I began thinking about these remarks,        31    00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.200    I expected, of course,        32    00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.430    to be on Harvard's campus,        33    00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.560    and I thought not a bad place to talk about    a free press,        34    00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.410    not a bad place to talk about our often testy    relationship with official power.        35    00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.380    It was in Boston after all where        36    00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.120    the first newspaper of the American colonies    was founded.        37    00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.150    Its first edition was published September    25th, 1690.        38    00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.270    The very next day, the Governor and Council    of Massachusetts shut it down.        39    00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.970    So the press of this country has long known    what it        40    00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.170    means to face a government that aims to silence    it.        41    00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.890    Fortunately, there has been progress.        42    00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:38.890    With the First Amendment,        43    00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.100    James Madison championed the right of ""freely    examining public characters and measures"".        44    00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.670    But it took a very long time before we as    a nation        45    00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.840    fully absorbed what Madison was talking about.        46    00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.530    We took many ominous turns.        47    00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.420    We had the Alien and Sedition Acts under John    Adams,        48    00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.290    the Sedition and Espionage Acts under Woodrow    Wilson, the McCarthy era.        49    00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.110    It was not always clear where we, as a nation,    would end up.        50    00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.390    Finally, witnessing the authoritarianism of    Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan,        51    00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.190    we began to secure a free press in this country.        52    00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.270    The Supreme Court would forcefully emphasize        53    00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.140    the press's role in guaranteeing a democracy.        54    00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.870    Justice Hugo Black said it well decades later,        55    00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.700    ''The press was protected so that it could    bare        56    00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.750    the secrets of government and inform the people.''        57    00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.120    Not only the secrets of government, I would    add,        58    00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.950    our duty to inform the public does not stop    there,        59    00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.830    not by a long shot.        60    00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.750    That was evident during my years as a journalist    in Boston.        61    00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.870    Amid today's crisis, it seems like another    era, and I guess it is.        62    00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.370    But I want to tell you about it because I    think it remains        63    00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.230    instructive about what a strong independent    press must do.        64    00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.700    I started as editor of The Boston Globe in    the summer of 2001.        65    00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.500    One day, prior to my start date,        66    00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.200    a Globe columnist wrote about a shocking case.        67    00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.850    A priest had been accused of abusing as many    as 80 kids.        68    00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:24.370    A lawsuit alleged that the cardinal in Boston    at the time knew about the serial abuse,        69    00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.090    didn't do anything about it,        70    00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:33.740    and repeatedly reassign this priest from parish    to parish warning no one over decades.        71    00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.850    The archdiocese called the accusations baseless    and reckless.        72    00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.600    The Globe columnist wrote that the truth might    never be known.        73    00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.840    Internal documents that might reveal it had    been sealed by a judge.        74    00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.840    On my first day of work,        75    00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.250    we asked the question,        76    00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.870    ''How do we get at the truth because the public    deserve to know?""        77    00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.470    That question led us to challenge the judge's    secrecy order,        78    00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.980    and our journalists launched an investigation    of their own.        79    00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.420    In early 2002, we published what we had learned    through        80    00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.460    reporting and by prevailing in court. We published    the truth.        81    00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.620    The cardinal did know about the abuse by this    priest,        82    00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.760    yet he kept him in ministry,        83    00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.960    thus enabling further abuse.        84    00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.150    Dozens of clergy in the diocese had committed    similar offenses.        85    00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.670    The cardinal had covered it all up and a bigger    truth would emerge.        86    00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.160    Covering up such abuse had been practiced    in policy in the church for decades.        87    00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.820    Only now the powerful were being held to account.        88    00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.710    Late in 2002, after hundreds of stories on    this subject,        89    00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.030    I received a letter from a Father Thomas P.    Doyle.        90    00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.600    Father Doyle had struggled for years in vain        91    00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.610    to get the Church to confront the very issue    we were writing about.        92    00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.080    He expressed deep gratitude for our work.        93    00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.730    ""It is momentous,"" he wrote,        94    00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.460    ""and its good effects will reverberate for    decades.""        95    00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.139    Father Doyle did not see journalists as the    enemy,        96    00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:17.470    he saw us as an ally when one was sorely needed.        97    00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.000    So did abuse survivors.        98    00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.310    I kept Father Doyle's letter on my desk,        99    00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:31.170    a daily reminder of what journalists must    do when we see evidence of wrongdoing.        100    00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.280    Harvard's commencement speaker two years ago,        101    00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.360    civil rights pioneer John Lewis once said    this,        102    00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.650    ''When you see something that is not right,        103    00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.510    not fair, not just, you have to speak up.        104    00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.280    You have to say something,        105    00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.660    you have to do something.''        106    00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.800    We as journalists have the capacity along    with        107    00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.560    the constitutional right to say and do something.        108    00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.180    We also have the obligation,        109    00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.200    and we must have the will.        110    00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:06.300    So must you. Every one of you has a stake    in this idea of free expression.        111    00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.770    You want to be free to express your views.        112    00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.840    You should be free to hear the views of others,        113    00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.919    the same or different.        114    00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:15.150    You want to be free to watch any movie,        115    00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.560    to read any book, to listen to any lyrics.        116    00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:25.860    You should be free to say what you know is    true without threat of government reprisal,        117    00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:32.010    and you should acknowledge this if you value    these freedoms that come with democracy.        118    00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:38.110    Democracy cannot exist without a free and    independent press; it never has.        119    00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.740    Leaders who crave more power for themselves        120    00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.180    always move quickly to crush an independent    press.        121    00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.740    Next, they destroy free expression itself.        122    00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:53.680    Sadly, much of the world is on that worrisome    path,        123    00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.180    and efforts in this country to demonize,        124    00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.490    delegitimize, and dehumanize the press give        125    00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:05.530    license to other governments to do the same    and to do far worse.        126    00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:06.970    By the end of last year,        127    00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:11.370    a near-record 250 journalists worldwide were    sitting in prison.        128    00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.540    Thirty of them faced accusations of        129    00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:21.669    ''false news'', a charge virtually unheard    of only seven years earlier.        130    00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:24.240    Turkey has been trading places with China    as number        131    00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.280    1 on the list of countries that jail the most    journalists.        132    00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.520    The Turkish government has shut down more    than 100 media outlets,        133    00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.979    and charged many journalists as terrorists.        134    00:08:35.979 --> 00:08:37.779    Independent media have been largely extinguished.        135    00:08:37.779 --> 00:08:40.770    China, of course, imposes some of        136    00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:45.370    the world's tightest censorship on what its    citizens can see and hear.        137    00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:51.230    In Hungary, the Prime Minister has waged war    on independent media.        138    00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.170    Harvard Nieman fellow, Andras Petho,        139    00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:56.020    who runs an investigative reporting center    there,        140    00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.640    notes that the Prime Minister's business allies    are, ''Taking        141    00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:05.650    over hundreds of outlets and turning them    into propaganda machines.''        142    00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:06.690    Like other heads of state,        143    00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.480    Hungary's Prime Minister has exploited the    pandemic        144    00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.940    to grab more power,        145    00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.290    suppress inconvenient facts, and escalate    pressure on news outlets.        146    00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.580    A new law threatens up to five-year jail terms    against        147    00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.580    those accused of spreading supposedly false    information.        148    00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.180    Independent news outlets have questioned how    the crisis was managed.        149    00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.850    The fear now is that such accountability journalism    will lead to        150    00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:39.620    harassment and arrest as it has in other countries.        151    00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.680    In the Philippines, the courageous Maria Ressa,        152    00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.430    who founded the country's largest online-only    new site,        153    00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.580    has been battling government harassment for    years on other fronts.        154    00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:55.830    She now faces prosecution on bogus charges    of violating foreign ownership laws.        155    00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:56.990    By the end of last year,        156    00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.690    she had posted bail eight times.        157    00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:06.030    Her real violation, she brought scrutiny to    the president.        158    00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.300    In Myanmar, two Reuters journalists,        159    00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.370    Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo,        160    00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.080    were imprisoned for more than 500 days for    investigating        161    00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.589    the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and    boys.        162    00:10:16.589 --> 00:10:21.670    Finally, a year ago, they were released.        163    00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.250    In 2018, an opinion writer for The Washington    Post,        164    00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.180    Jamal Khashoggi, walked into        165    00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:33.140    Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul to get    documents he needed to marry.        166    00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:38.220    He was murdered there at the hands of a team    sent by a highest level Saudi officials.        167    00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:45.839    His offense, he had sharply criticized the    Saudi government.        168    00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:49.300    In Mexico, murders, vengeance against journalists    is common.        169    00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.080    Last year, at least five were killed,        170    00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.100    more than in any other country.        171    00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:02.280    I think also of the risks that American journalists    have taken to inform the public.        172    00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.779    Among them are colleagues I can never forget.        173    00:11:05.779 --> 00:11:07.130    One is Elizabeth Neuffer,        174    00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.190    17 years ago this month,        175    00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.620    I stood before her friends at the Boston Globe    to        176    00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:16.110    report that she had died covering a war in    Iraq.        177    00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.000    Elizabeth was 46, an experienced foreign correspondent,        178    00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.430    a mentor to others, vivacious and brave.        179    00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.960    Her Iraqi driver was traveling at high speed    because of        180    00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.430    the risk of abductions, he lost control.        181    00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:35.080    Elizabeth died instantly, her translator too.        182    00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.839    Elizabeth had a record of fearlessness in        183    00:11:36.839 --> 00:11:40.270    investigating war crimes and human rights    abuses.        184    00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:49.720    Her goal, reveal the world as it is because    someone might then make things better.        185    00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.510    Another colleague was Anthony Shadid.        186    00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.160    In 2002, I visited Anthony,        187    00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.180    then a reporter for The Globe,        188    00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.540    after he was shot and wounded in Ramallah.        189    00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.070    Lying in a hospital in Jerusalem,        190    00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:05.920    it was clear that he had narrowly escaped    being paralyzed.        191    00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.060    Anthony recovered and went on to report from    Iraq,        192    00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.149    where he won two Pulitzer Prizes for the Washington    Post.        193    00:12:11.149 --> 00:12:15.540    From Egypt, where he was harassed by police,    from Libya,        194    00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.110    where he and three New York Times colleagues    were detained by        195    00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:23.540    pro-government militias and physically abused.        196    00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.530    He died in 2012 at age 43,        197    00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.420    while reporting in Syria,        198    00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.730    apparently of an asthma attack.        199    00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.399    Anthony told the stories of ordinary people.        200    00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:40.270    Without him, their voices would have gone    unheard.        201    00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.930    Now I think constantly of reporters, photographers,    and videographers,        202    00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:49.120    who risk their own well-being to be with heroic    frontline health workers.        203    00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.080    Frontline workers of every sort,        204    00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.200    to share their stories.        205    00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.709    Anthony, Elizabeth, and my present-day colleagues    sought to be eyewitnesses,        206    00:12:58.709 --> 00:13:01.350    to see the facts for themselves,        207    00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:05.000    to discover the truth and tell it.        208    00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.500    As a professional, we maintain there is such    a thing as fact,        209    00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.410    there is such a thing as truth.        210    00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:15.980    At Harvard, where the schools motto is veritas.        211    00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.490    Presumably, you do too.        212    00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:25.370    Truth we know, is not a matter of who wields    power or who speaks loudest.        213    00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:31.110    It has nothing to do with who benefits or    what is most popular.        214    00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.279    Ever since the Enlightenment,        215    00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:34.660    modern society has rejected the idea,        216    00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:39.370    that truth derives from any single authority    on earth.        217    00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.680    To determine what is factual and true,        218    00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.180    we rely on certain building blocks.        219    00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:52.089    Start with education, then there is expertise    and experience.        220    00:13:52.089 --> 00:13:57.600    Above all, we rely on evidence.        221    00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.080    We see that acutely now,        222    00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.810    when people's health can be jeopardized by    false claims,        223    00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:09.560    wishful thinking, and invented realities.        224    00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.330    The public safety requires the honest truth.        225    00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:17.100    Yet education, expertise, experience,        226    00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:21.990    and evidence are being devalued, dismissed,    and denied.        227    00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:28.890    The goal is clear, to undermine the very idea    of objective fact,        228    00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.170    all in pursuit of political game.        229    00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:35.290    Along with that is a systematic effort to        230    00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:40.580    disqualify traditional independent arbiters    of fact,        231    00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.410    the press tops the list of targets,        232    00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:49.110    but others populate the list too: courts,    historians,        233    00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:52.769    even scientists and medical professionals,        234    00:14:52.769 --> 00:14:56.860    subject matter experts of every type.        235    00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:01.870    So today, the governments leading scientists    find their motives questioned,        236    00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:07.540    their qualifications mocked, despite a lifetime    of dedication and achievement,        237    00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:11.640    that has made us all safer.        238    00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:17.130    In any democracy, we want vigorous debate    about our challenges and the correct policies.        239    00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:22.610    But what becomes of democracy if we cannot    agree on a common set of facts,        240    00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:27.250    if we can't agree on what even constitutes    a fact?        241    00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.950    Are we headed for extreme tribalism,        242    00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:33.490    believing only what our ideological soulmates    say?        243    00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:38.630    Or do we become so cynical that we think everyone    always lies for selfish reasons?        244    00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:44.620    Or so nihilistic that we conclude no one can    ever really know what is true or false?        245    00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.079    So no use trying to find out.        246    00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:52.959    Regardless, we risk entering dangerous territory.        247    00:15:52.959 --> 00:15:56.660    Hannah Arendt, in 1951,        248    00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.120    wrote of this in her first major work.        249    00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.850    The Origins of Totalitarianism.        250    00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:07.130    There she observed, ""The possibility that    gigantic        251    00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:12.829    lies and monstrous falsehoods can eventually    be established as unquestioned facts.""        252    00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:16.190    That the difference between truth and falsehood    may cease to be        253    00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:21.269    objective and may become a mere matter of    power and cleverness,        254    00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:26.180    of pressure and infinite repetition.        255    00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.660    One hundred years ago in 1920,        256    00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.590    a renowned journalist and leading thinker,        257    00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:35.410    Walter Lippmann, harbored similar worries.        258    00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:38.610    Lippmann, once a writer for the Harvard Crimson,        259    00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:41.589    warned of a society where people cease to        260    00:16:41.589 --> 00:16:45.670    respond to truth and respond simply to opinions;        261    00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:51.080    what somebody asserts, not what actually is.        262    00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:55.089    Lippmann wrote those words because of concerns    about the press itself.        263    00:16:55.089 --> 00:16:58.690    He saw our defects and hope we might fix them,        264    00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:03.660    thus improving how information got to the    public.        265    00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.639    Ours is a profession that still has many flaws.        266    00:17:06.639 --> 00:17:10.510    We make mistakes of fact and we make mistakes    of judgment.        267    00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:17.339    We are at times overly impressed with what    we know when much remains for us to learn.        268    00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:22.850    In making mistakes, we are like people in    every other profession,        269    00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:26.569    and we too must be held accountable.        270    00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:28.029    What frequently gets lost though,        271    00:17:28.029 --> 00:17:31.730    is the contribution of a free and independent    press to        272    00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:36.649    our communities and our country, and to the    truth.        273    00:17:36.649 --> 00:17:41.649    I think back to the aftermath of Hurricane    Andrew in 1992,        274    00:17:41.649 --> 00:17:44.690    when the Miami Herald showed how LAX zoning,    inspection,        275    00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:49.220    and building codes had contributed to the    massive destruction.        276    00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:54.360    Homes and lives are safer today, as a result.        277    00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.940    In 2016, the Charleston Gazette-Mail in        278    00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:01.139    West Virginia exposed how opioids have flooded    the state's depressed communities,        279    00:18:01.139 --> 00:18:04.929    contributing to the highest death rates in    the country.        280    00:18:04.929 --> 00:18:08.100    In 2005 after Hurricane Katrina,        281    00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:13.460    Louisiana's newspapers were indispensable    sources of reliable information for residents.        282    00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:17.450    The Washington Post in 2007,        283    00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:23.679    reveal the shameful neglect and mistreatment    of wounded veterans at Walter Reed Hospital.        284    00:18:23.679 --> 00:18:25.220    Corrective action was immediate.        285    00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:33.230    The Associated Press in 2015 documented a    slave trade behind our seafood supply.        286    00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:37.630    Two thousand slaves were freed as a result.        287    00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:40.990    The New York Times and The New Yorker in 2017,        288    00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:44.409    exposed sexual predators in elite boardrooms.        289    00:18:44.409 --> 00:18:49.990    A movement of accountability for abuses against    women took root.        290    00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.830    In New York Times in 1971,        291    00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.740    was the first to publish the Pentagon Papers,        292    00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.809    revealing a pattern of official deceit in    a war that killed more than        293    00:18:58.809 --> 00:19:03.109    58,000 Americans and countless others.        294    00:19:03.109 --> 00:19:09.030    The Washington Post broke open the Watergate    scandal in 1972.        295    00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:15.289    That led ultimately to the President's resignation.        296    00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:21.429    Those news organizations searched for the    truth and told it,        297    00:19:21.429 --> 00:19:28.240    undeterred by pushback, or pressure, or vilification.        298    00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:32.869    Facing the truth can cause extreme discomfort.        299    00:19:32.869 --> 00:19:38.220    But history shows that we as a nation become    better for that reckoning.        300    00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:46.460    It is in the spirit of the preamble to our    Constitution to form a more perfect union.        301    00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:52.139    Toward that end, it is an act of patriotism.    W. E. B.        302    00:19:52.139 --> 00:19:56.710    Du Bois, the great scholar and African American    activist,        303    00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:01.779    and the first African American to graduate    with a PhD from Harvard,        304    00:20:01.779 --> 00:20:07.369    cautioned against the falsification of events    in relating our nation's history.        305    00:20:07.369 --> 00:20:13.929    In 1935, distressed at how deceitfully America's    reconstruction period was being taught,        306    00:20:13.929 --> 00:20:17.639    Du Bois assail the propaganda of the era.        307    00:20:17.639 --> 00:20:21.399    ""Nations real and stagger on their way,"" he    wrote.        308    00:20:21.399 --> 00:20:24.149    ""They make hideous mistakes,        309    00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:26.679    they commit frightful wrongs,        310    00:20:26.679 --> 00:20:30.179    they do great and beautiful things,        311    00:20:30.179 --> 00:20:34.049    and shall we not best guide humanity by telling        312    00:20:34.049 --> 00:20:40.359    the truth about all this so far as the truth    be ascertainable?""        313    00:20:40.359 --> 00:20:48.519    At this university, you answer that question    with your motto, veritas.        314    00:20:48.519 --> 00:20:51.629    You seek the truth, with scholarship,        315    00:20:51.629 --> 00:20:57.929    teaching, and dialogue, knowing that it really    matters.        316    00:20:57.929 --> 00:21:01.239    My profession shares with you that mission,        317    00:21:01.239 --> 00:21:04.859    be always arduous, often tortuous,        318    00:21:04.859 --> 00:21:08.080    and yet essential pursuit of truth.        319    00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:12.989    It is the demand that democracy makes upon    us.        320    00:21:12.989 --> 00:21:18.230    It is the work we must do.        321    00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:22.129    We will keep at it. You should too.        322    00:21:22.129 --> 00:21:27.440    None of us should ever stop.        323    00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.350    Thank you for listening.        324    00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.710    Thank you for honoring me.        325    00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:35.609    Good luck to you all and please stay well.

begin.        18    00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.190    Greetings graduates,    faculty, parents, relatives,        19    00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.580    Zoom bombers, and the true heroes today,        20    00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.320    the Harvard IT Department.        21    00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.690    Really nice compression, guys.        22    00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.410    Beautiful, very little buffering.        23    00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.310    Nice job nerds.        24    00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.980    Welcome to Harvard's    first online graduation,        25    00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.754    and congratulations to    the Harvard Class of 2020.        26    00:01:52.754 --> 00:01:54.163    (claps) Yes.        27    00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.620    I wanna begin by telling    you that the administration        28    00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.150    has given me only 10    minutes to speak today,        29    00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.793    instead of the traditional 20.        30    00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.620    I promised to do my best, since everyone's        31    00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.620    in such a big hurry to get back    to doing absolutely nothing!        32    00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.670    I'd like to take just a moment    to thank Harvard College        33    00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.400    for bestowing upon me an honorary degree,        34    00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.160    Doctorate of Humane    Letters and Philosophy.        35    00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.420    I am truly, truly honored.        36    00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.020    I'd also like to thank Harvard        37    00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.360    for a doctorate honoring    my groundbreaking work        38    00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.036    in both sonic string theory    and condensed matter physics.        39    00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:43.780    Thank you, thank you, I    worked with a great team,        40    00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.170    thank you all.        41    00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.410    Seniors, I know you belong        42    00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.890    in the Tercentenary Theatre right now,        43    00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.120    believe me all of us miss Harvard Yard.        44    00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.740    I mean, where else can you find        45    00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.740    two competing pro-communist newsletters        46    00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.470    written in Dothraki all    while signing a petition        47    00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.090    to ban hotdogs and donuts        48    00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.010    for promoting cisgender identities.        49    00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.130    What a rare and unusual place.        50    00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.140    But trust me, we are taking steps        51    00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.000    to make today's commencement    feel as authentic as possible.        52    00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.700    In fact, right now, Harvard    is charging each of you $50        53    00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.580    for parking in Cambridge.        54    00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.260    Yeah, plus, Harvard will see to it        55    00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.620    that within the next hour,    one of your grandparents        56    00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.223    will be hit in the head    with a stray Frisbee.        57    00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.430    And be assured, one day in the future,        58    00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.040    you will return to your    alma mater, but for now,        59    00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.670    you get to enjoy me speaking    to you from my backyard.        60    00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.940    Harvard has been graduating    students for nearly 400 years.        61    00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.370    This is the first one        62    00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.870    where the commencement    speaker is standing on a spot        63    00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.600    where his dog urinated seven minutes ago.        64    00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.630    Right over here.        65    00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.520    This area, yes.        66    00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.550    Yes, this commencement    will be very different.        67    00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.550    As you sit here today, or    stand, or microwave a burrito,        68    00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.120    or ride a Peloton, or    recline uncomfortably        69    00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.070    in your childhood bed, or mine Bitcoin,        70    00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.000    or Google who is Conan O'Brien,        71    00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000    you are witnessing many, many    firsts in today's ceremony.        72    00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.870    For example, normally, graduates    would greet and shake hands        73    00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.860    with their faculty deans,        74    00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.380    but now that shaking    hands is a Class D Felony,        75    00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.850    those faculty members decided instead        76    00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.893    to give you a virtual butt bump on TikTok.        77    00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.050    Yeah, and by the way, congratulations        78    00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.470    to the department heads,        79    00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.863    you really captured what    Cotton Mather was all about.        80    00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.030    In another first,        81    00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.490    this year Harvard has    discarded traditional grading        82    00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.030    and switched to a pass/fail system.        83    00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.810    That's right, as a result,        84    00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.193    several members of the    lacrosse team will graduate.        85    00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.540    And finally, for the first time,        86    00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.250    all of you will receive    your diplomas by mail.        87    00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.470    Now to make sure those diplomas        88    00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.360    are not stolen from your    porch by package thieves,        89    00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.950    they will be mailed to you    in a plain brown wrapper        90    00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.823    labeled Cornell University Diploma.        91    00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.330    It's foolproof (laughs).        92    00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.357    No one's touching that thing (laughs).        93    00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.920    Now I know for all of you,        94    00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.010    this is not the graduation    ceremony you were expecting.        95    00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.660    Right now, your parents are realizing        96    00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.900    they spent hundreds of    thousands of dollars        97    00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.060    just to watch you basically graduate        98    00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.140    from an online university.        99    00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.650    In fact, this speech is    being simulcast right now        100    00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.830    to the University of Phoenix.        101    00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.345    Yeah! (laughs)        102    00:05:33.345 --> 00:05:36.720    (orchestral music)    Phoenix, Phoenix!        103    00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.460    Phoenix gets it done, yeah!        104    00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.272    They get it done in two    years, not four, uh!        105    00:05:41.272 --> 00:05:44.189    (orchestral music)        106    00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.490    Anyway, I know what some of    you are wondering right now.        107    00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.260    How could Conan, as his    age, possibly relate to me?        108    00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.010    Well to you I say, do not think of me        109    00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.290    as someone who graduated    Harvard 35 years ago.        110    00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.460    Think of me as a fellow classmate,        111    00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.550    a fellow classmate who looks like shit.        112    00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.040    Somehow kind of wrinkled and    bloated at the same time.        113    00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.610    Very hard to do.        114    00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.120    You see, I have some experience    as a graduation speaker.        115    00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.840    20 years ago, I told the    graduating Harvard Students        116    00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.970    to break out of their    cocoon and take chances.        117    00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.530    Well, 20 years later, I'd    like to amend that slightly        118    00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.950    and say, stay in your cocoon!        119    00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.950    Stay, the cocoon, stay in it.        120    00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.570    I had no idea about the virus.        121    00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.420    And to you students who've    moved back home to a blue state,        122    00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.320    please continue to be patient,    wear a face mask outside,        123    00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.170    and trust in science.        124    00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.490    To those of you who moved    back home to a red state,        125    00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.573    I'll see you guys tonight at Applebee's!        126    00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.750    Get those onion rings!        127    00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.940    So do not despair this online    ceremony, but celebrate it.        128    00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.090    You have been handed two choices.        129    00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.120    Use the trial of this global pandemic        130    00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.330    as the inspirational launching    pad to a greater destiny,        131    00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.140    or two, go the Trump route,    and blame all your problems        132    00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.410    on the previous graduating class.        133    00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.670    Come on, who's with me,    damn you class of 2019,        134    00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:11.963    damn you to hell.        135    00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.200    If nothing else, just make that a t-shirt.        136    00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.580    Damn you to hell, 2019, that's a seller,        137    00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.653    that moves, that's merch that moves.        138    00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.890    I realize I've said many    foolish things to you today.        139    00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.080    It's kind of what I do.        140    00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.420    But I would like to be sincere.        141    00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:35.450    Before I spoke today,    I really did give you,        142    00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.280    the Class of 2020, serious thought.        143    00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.000    And I'm honestly stunned        144    00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.020    by what you've endured    in your short lives.        145    00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.570    For my Harvard class,    9/11 came in midlife.        146    00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.600    But I was thinking about it,    you came into consciousness        147    00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.040    while our nation was still    smoldering from that attack,        148    00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.430    and you've only known a world    beset by terrorist hate.        149    00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.560    You've grown up with mass    shootings and school lockdowns,        150    00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.973    horrors completely    absent from my childhood.        151    00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.360    You have now witnessed    two economic meltdowns        152    00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.840    of stunning proportions.        153    00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.720    You are actually living in a hotter        154    00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.580    and more treacherous biosphere    than the one I was born into.        155    00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.090    Two months into your freshman year,        156    00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.870    many of you voted for the first    time in the 2016 election,        157    00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.710    and ever since, you've been living        158    00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.133    in the most polarized United    States since the Civil War.        159    00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.770    Now this you know all too well.        160    00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.340    You've been handed more than your share.        161    00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.610    Tom Brokaw famously hailed the people        162    00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.200    who survived the Great    Depression and World War Two,        163    00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.200    not because of who they were,    as much as what they endured.        164    00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.880    He called them the greatest generation.        165    00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.330    Now we don't know what you will be called        166    00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.650    because the generation    that cleaned up the mess        167    00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.850    left by those a-hole boomers        168    00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.603    doesn't just roll off the tongue.        169    00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.550    You've been challenged your entire lives,        170    00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.760    and you've demonstrated        171    00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.150    one of the most precious    qualities one can have.        172    00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.670    Resilience.        173    00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.440    Now cynics like to mock    the supposedly spoiled        174    00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.150    or callow youth of the new millennia.        175    00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.630    But you have seen and survived so much.        176    00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:15.740    And you've responded with wit,    creativity, righteous anger,        177    00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.940    activism, and a gritty determination        178    00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.010    to take the reality you've    been handed and make it better.        179    00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.730    Look at you, 10 weeks ago,        180    00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.560    you were told to leave    your dorms immediately,        181    00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.500    get your stuff, get out,        182    00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.610    something no one has said to    me since my first marriage.        183    00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.150    And since that day, you    have found ways to stay safe        184    00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.270    under absurd and confusing circumstances.        185    00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.370    And one way or the other,    your hard won resilience        186    00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.980    has gotten you here, today,    to your TV, or phone,        187    00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.950    or tablet, or smartwatch,        188    00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.883    to graduate from Harvard    come hell or high water.        189    00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.960    As the father of two teenage children,        190    00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.280    I look at all you've achieved    in a frightful world,        191    00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.290    and it gives me great hope.        192    00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.630    You are remarkable examples to my children        193    00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.850    of how to be smart, brave,        194    00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:08.083    and yes, resilient in a scary world.        195    00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.810    My generation was always embarrassed        196    00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:14.160    to admit we went to Harvard,    for fear of bragging.        197    00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.220    But you, class of 2020,    have earned the right        198    00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.400    to be proud of your great accomplishment.        199    00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.340    The next time someone asks    you where you went to college,        200    00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.140    hold your head high, look    'em square in the eye        201    00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.153    and say two miles south of Tufts.        202    00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.990    So today is unusual in two respects.        203    00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.870    First, as I've said,        204    00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.540    this iconic 384-year-old    ceremony is online.        205    00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.960    And we are strangely separate on a day        206    00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.183    that's supposed to embody community.        207    00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.350    Second, and more    important, today's unusual        208    00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.523    because at this commencement,    you commence nothing.        209    00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.480    You and your uniquely tested peers,        210    00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.020    your generation commenced long ago        211    00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.770    while the rest of us were busy complaining        212    00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:04.293    about the Sopranos finale.        213    00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:08.970    I have nothing to give you    that you don't already have.        214    00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.640    And have had for a very long time.        215    00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.250    What I can offer is my    boundless admiration,        216    00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:19.100    my deepest respect, my    gratitude for working so hard,        217    00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.730    and bringing such honor to your families,        218    00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.913    your faculty, and your alumni.        219    00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.870    Our current troubles will pass,        220    00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:31.020    and you will laugh and thrive    and experience great joy.        221    00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.790    I cannot wait to see what you    fine people will accomplish,        222    00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.860    and I know that one day, years from now,        223    00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:42.860    one of you will stand where    I stand, here in my backyard.        224    00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.433    And I will have you    arrested for trespassing.        225    00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:49.643    Thank you.        226    00:11:49.643 --> 00:11:54.641    (orchestral music)    (audience cheers and applauds)        227    00:11:56.105 --> 00:11:57.163    Thank you.        228    00:11:57.163 --> 00:12:02.163    (orchestral music)    (audience cheers and applauds)        "

That list        28    00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.769    might promise her daughters a        29    00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.460    better future.        30    00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.800    But there was one problem:        31    00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.540    My mother was illiterate.        32    00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.560    She did not        33    00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.640    know how to write her name - Favilla Takjerad.        34    00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.640    Dejected, she walked away.        35    00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.880    A man noticed her and ran after her.        36    00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.620    He got my mother's name and wrote it        37    00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.920    down on the list.        38    00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.080    [APPLAUSE]        39    00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.520    A few months later        40    00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.960    my family was fortunate to emigrate to        41    00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.740    France.        42    00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.620    I was sad to leave my beloved    homeland,        43    00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.540    caring neighbors,        44    00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.720    childhood friends and extended family.        45    00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.820    But I knew that        46    00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.760    bright opportunities awaited me.        47    00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.920    Had I stayed in my village,        48    00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.820    assuming I was spared from bullets or bombs,        49    00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.900    My life would have been very different.        50    00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.060    I would not have become the first woman in my        51    00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.060    family to graduate from college,        52    00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.330    to work and live abroad.        53    00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.599    I would not have had the        54    00:03:52.600 --> 00:04:00.300    chance to call Harvard my home this past year.        55    00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.200    As we are graduating today I still        56    00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.920    find myself asking        57    00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.980    why did this    wonderful man run after my mother?        58    00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:21.720    A simple gesture of writing a stranger's    name on a page offered an entire family        59    00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.060    hope for a better life.        60    00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.320    He will probably never know the        61    00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.960    difference he made        62    00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.700    but from the small    seeds of his goodness        63    00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.630    have grown fruits        64    00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.380    of prosperity        65    00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.020    for my family        66    00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.380    myself        67    00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.300    and everyone who we touch.        68    00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.020    I now have the        69    00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.800    ability to shape my world.        70    00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.200    But this ability was sparked by one        71    00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.840    little encounter which lit up the course    of my life.        72    00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.580    So that is the real power,        73    00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.520    the power of little things.        74    00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.160    The least you can do        75    00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.380    can bring true change.        76    00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.880    Perhaps        77    00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.640    you have been blessed in your lives        78    00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.060    with small gifts that made big changes.        79    00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.020    Maybe it was a teacher who instilled in you    her love of a certain subject        80    00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.000    Or a kind stranger who helped you with directions    when you are lost.        81    00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.180    At Harvard I see it        82    00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:47.270    every day in the smiles of the cafeteria    staff who keep me so well        83    00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.740    caffeinated.        84    00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.860    And in ad-hoc babysitting    circles, small things,        85    00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.660    such small things.        86    00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.820    But from these small things grow    inspired people,        87    00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.780    lasting friendships and        88    00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.220    stronger communities.        89    00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.500    When one person    thanks another the second person often        90    00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.980    replies, oh, it's the least they can do        91    00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:29.150    because often the least you can do can        92    00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.080    can be more than enough.        93    00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.680    You don't need to    move mountains        94    00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.340    maybe it's a matter of        95    00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.510    translating documents for a family at    immigration office who        96    00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.360    or offering a car ride        97    00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.820    to a pregnant lady.        98    00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.600    You never know    how these small gestures can affect        99    00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.860    people's lives.        100    00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:58.080    But I can tell you, they    do.        101    00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.260    Fellow graduates, of course do the        102    00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.880    most you can do.        103    00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.500    Your education and    legacy demand it.        104    00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.040    But also        105    00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.640    do the least you can do.        106    00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.940    Because the least we can do    might turn out to be the most        107    00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.100    significant.        108    00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.800    And to that gentleman in Algeria,        109    00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.220    I now say        110    00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:30.180    (speaking Algerian)        111    00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.856    Thank you and    God bless you.        112    00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.270    And to each of you today        113    00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.120    I ask of you:        114    00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.260    what is the least you can do        115    00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.720    now to make the world around you a        116    00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.160    little better.        117    00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:56.540    [APPLAUSE]        "

00:11:02.030    OUR ABILITY TO MEET THEM AND MAY    HARVARD CONTINUE TO BE A        172    00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:05.750    WELLSPRING OF HOPE FOR THE    WORLD.        173    00:11:05.750 -->

  00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.319    MULTIPLE COMAE AND SURGERIES,    THIS COMMUNITY FED US, CLOTHED        41    00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.430    US, AND WATCHED US.        42    00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.069    IT WAS ON THE PLAYGROUNDS OF    THIS CONCRETE JUNGLE THAT I        43    00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.969    LEARNED WHAT A HOME LOOKED LIKE.        44    00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:30.829    EVERY VECINA IN OUR BUILDING, AT    4 METCALF COURT, LIT A CANDLE        45    00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.920    FOR MY FAMILY.        46    00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.709    IT WAS THE FLICKER OF THOSE RED    CANDLES THAT BROUGHT MY FAMILY        47    00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:48.390    AND ME ALL OF THE WAY HERE TO    HARVARD YARD.        48    00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:58.100    [CHEERS & APPLAUSE]    I REMEMBER SITTING IN THE        49    00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.001    STAIRWELLS OF WELD HALL ON    MOVE-IN DAY, LOOKING UP AT MY        50    00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:04.609    FATHER.        51    00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.959    THAT DAY WAS THE FIRST TIME IN    30 YEARS OF LIVING IN THE UNITED        52    00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.969    STATES, OF LIVING IN THE STATE    OF MASSACHUSETTS, IN BOSTON,        53    00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:16.670    THAT HE HAD    STEPPED FOOT INTO HARVARD YARD.        54    00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:22.620    AS I SAT THERE, I RECALLED THE    DAY THAT I, A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL,        55    00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:30.889    WAS MOVING OUT OF HER HOME AT    METCALF COURT.        56    00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.080    WHEN WE LEFT THOSE PROJECT    BUILDINGS, MY PARENTS DID NOT        57    00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.460    LOOK BACK.        58    00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.360    BUT TODAY, I DO.        59    00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.610    IN THAT MOMENT, SITTING ON THOSE    STAIRS IN WELD, I REMEMBERED HOW        60    00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.000    I, AS A CHILD, WOULD SIT AND    WAIT FOR MY SCHOOL BUS ON THE        61    00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.389    STAIRWELLS IN MY APARTMENT    BUILDING.        62    00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:07.070    I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AND REALIZED    JUST HOW FAR I HAD TRAVELED.        63    00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:13.610    THOUGH FAIRLY CLOSE, CAMBRIDGE--    LET ME BE MORE SPECIFIC--        64    00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.199    HARVARD STILL FEELS WORLDS APART    FROM THE COURTYARDS AT SOUTH        65    00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.500    STREET THAT GAVE ME MY FIRST    SCARS WHEN I FELL OFF OF        66    00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:30.160    YAMILEX'S MAGENTA    BARBIE-STICKERED BIKE.        67    00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.880    THESE BRICK BUILDINGS, THOUGH    THEIR FACADE MAY BE SIMILAR,        68    00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:42.389    STILL SWELL WITH THE PRIVILEGE    THAT LIES BEHIND THEIR WALLS,        69    00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:49.199    THE PRIVILEGE OF OPPORTUNITY.        70    00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:54.289    HERE AT HARVARD, I HAVE FOUND    WOMEN SIMILAR TO ANA-- A LOT        71    00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:01.060    YOUNGER, BUT ALSO WILLING TO    STAY UP WITH ME AS I FILLED        72    00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.050    ELIOT'S D ENTRYWAY WITH SHRILL    CRIES WHEN MY MOTHER WAS        73    00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.620    DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER.        74    00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:17.280    IF THE WALLS IN ELIOT HOUSE, IF    THE WALLS AT 4 METCALF COURT,        75    00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.190    COULD SPEAK, THEY WOULD HAVE    ENOUGH STORIES TO FILL SEVERAL        76    00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:30.720    NOVELS, TESTIFYING TO THE PAIN    AND TRAUMA, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY        77    00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.020    THE    LOVE AND SUPPORT I'VE RECEIVED        78    00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.690    IN MY VARIOUS HOMES.        79    00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:45.669    HARVARD IS A HOME, AND WE ALL    HAVE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIPS        80    00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:49.970    WITH HOME.        81    00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:55.470    BUT IT IS A PLACE THAT HAS    TOUCHED US ALL.        82    00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.360    AND AS WE LEAVE THIS HOME THAT    WE HAVE CREATED HERE AS A        83    00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:05.940    COMMUNITY, I URGE US TO THINK    ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE        84    00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.370    HAVE BEEN GIVEN.        85    00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:14.319    LET US THINK ABOUT THE    PRIVILEGES GRANTED TO US AS WE        86    00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:21.220    GO THROUGH THE WORLD CARRYING A    HARVARD DIPLOMA.        87    00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:28.819    LET US REFLECT, BUT MORE    IMPORTANTLY, BE        88    00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:30.280    CONSCIOUS.        89    00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:39.190    CONSCIOUS OF THE WEIGHT THAT OUR    EDUCATION HOLDS.        90    00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:44.111    CONSCIOUS OF ALL OF THOSE WHO    SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE        91    00:07:44.111 --> 00:07:47.669    OPPORTUNITY.        92    00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:54.389    IT COULD RIGHTFULLY HAVE BEEN    SOMEONE ELSE IN OUR PLACE, BUT        93    00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:56.889    IT WAS US.        94    00:07:56.889 --> 00:08:05.320    NOW, WHAT WILL WE DO WITH WHAT    WE HAVE GAINED HERE?        95    00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:12.169    I HOPE THAT AS WE ANSWER THIS    FOR OURSELVES, WE LEAD NOT WITH        96    00:08:12.169 --> 00:08:19.159    OUR PRIVILEGE BUT INSTEAD WORK    WITH A DESIRE TO CREATE        97    00:08:19.159 --> 00:08:33.930    OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHERS.        98    00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:40.640    [APPLAUSE]        "

   00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.659    as a little girl growing up in a farm        2    00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.200    just outside of Nairobi Kenya I spent a        3    00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.300    lot of time wondering about the world        4    00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.170    outside        5    00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.380    I spent my weekends watching TV and        6    00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.759    listening to music        7    00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.940    I watched old sixties movies on school        8    00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.740    nights when I was supposed to be asleep        9    00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.300    and I read a lot of books I mean a lot        10    00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.900    of books I devoured media because I was        11    00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.420    thirsty to understand the world outside        12    00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.079    the confines of my otherwise simple        13    00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.910    comfortable and incredibly joyful        14    00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.140    upbringing so it was no surprise that        15    00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.840    everything I knew about America I knew        16    00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.539    from media and this was before social        17    00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.789    media so the variety of images I had of        18    00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.160    the United States was limited to what        19    00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.730    movies wanted me an outsider to know        20    00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.100    about this land of the free and home of        21    00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.829    the brave the watched movies about        22    00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.020    American high schools in particular and        23    00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.570    I found them absolutely fascinating and        24    00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.020    I learnt a lot for example I learned        25    00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.549    that in America you could walk out of        26    00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.740    classes before teachers dismissed you        27    00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.320    just as long as the Bell had rang and I        28    00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.750    thought to myself indeed this is the        29    00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.700    land of the free and the home of the        30    00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.850    brave because that kind of behavior        31    00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.600    wouldn't fly where I'm from in America        32    00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.820    becoming homecoming king and homecoming        33    00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.610    queen was a big deal but I never        34    00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.229    understood where home was        35    00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.450    or where people had gone enough to be        36    00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.530    coming I also learned that in America        37    00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.689    everyone was always looking for a prom        38    00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.110    date and that if you dropped your books        39    00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.360    and someone picks them up for you and        40    00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.770    gazed into your eyes then at the end of        41    00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.329    the year they would become your prom        42    00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.630    date        43    00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.140    to date I find it utterly impressive        44    00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.630    that the content was that consistent        45    00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.710    across the board        46    00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.049    you watched Mean Girls and it it was        47    00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.689    like you had watched everything yet        48    00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.450    these thoroughly analyzed case studies        49    00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.940    of my peers could never have prepared me        50    00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.500    for the past four years as an        51    00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.350    international student at Harvard in fact        52    00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.050    in a way I held a lot of misconceptions        53    00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.000    about the United States because of them        54    00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.230    now I know more often than not this        55    00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.209    phenomenon happens the other way around        56    00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.670    for instance if I walk into a room and I        57    00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.340    say hi my name is ma Bay and I'm from        58    00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.980    Nairobi Kenya a lot of things might go        59    00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.910    through your mind like wow she speaks        60    00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.810    such good English or perhaps you might        61    00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.819    ask yourself the age-old question and        62    00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.560    what I'm sure we are all wondering today        63    00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.230    I wonder whether she's listened to        64    00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.220    ariana grande's music yet in the same        65    00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.560    way I too had my own stereotypes about        66    00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.079    the United States there were stories I        67    00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.150    had heard throughout my life that had        68    00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.340    embedded plenty of assumptions in my        69    00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.010    mind racial stereotypes stereotypes        70    00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.900    about people from different        71    00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.510    socioeconomic backgrounds stereotypes        72    00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.570    about American preferences at times I        73    00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.340    wouldn't realize I had these perceptions        74    00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.590    in my mind but I always found myself        75    00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.739    holding on to them ever so tightly        76    00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.359    whenever I encountered something new or        77    00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.310    different that I wasn't willing to try        78    00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.160    the thing with stereotypes that makes        79    00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.530    them so powerful is that they menacingly        80    00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.260    appear to be true and that it can be so        81    00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.989    comfortable to hold on to them because        82    00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.109    predictability is easy to work with new        83    00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.959    ones makes things complicated new ones        84    00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.319    doesn't fit into policy or captivating        85    00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.900    film narratives and once you're        86    00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.519    comfortable enough in what you know        87    00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.139    there's no reason to step out of it I        88    00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.920    have always been fascinated by people        89    00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.440    cultures history why we think the way we        90    00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.380    think based on where we grew up or our        91    00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.409    experiences and it was this fascination        92    00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.150    that led me to the anthropology        93    00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.660    department        94    00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.330    I was excited at the prospect of a        95    00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.580    concentration where for the most part I        96    00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.130    got to observe people and theorize about        97    00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.390    why they do what they do at first this        98    00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.790    started as a self centered process in        99    00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.560    the midst of my debilitating        100    00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.530    homesickness and reluctance to adjust I        101    00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.260    needed an excuse to get to get out of        102    00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.970    having to engage with this new country        103    00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.000    and its people by delving deeper to        104    00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.550    understand myself my roots and my        105    00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.130    culture on any lovely Wednesday        106    00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.020    afternoon you'd find me at a section in        107    00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.540    tazza either finding a way to connect        108    00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.120    every possible theory to the African        109    00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.000    continent or vehemently reporting to        110    00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.920    something appear had said and it always        111    00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.200    sounded like well I just want to push        112    00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.350    back on that for a little bit and say        113    00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.850    that that is based on a very Western        114    00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.880    framework of thinking around my friends        115    00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.760    I started every statement in with in my        116    00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.910    culture especially when I didn't want to        117    00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.820    try something new like in my culture we        118    00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.370    don't eat quinoa or in my culture we        119    00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.810    don't ask professors about their        120    00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.930    weekends or agree to call them by their        121    00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.180    first names I'm sorry Dean Cora I mean        122    00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.130    okay and while this transformative        123    00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.880    liberal arts education has given me        124    00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:34.709    has given me the tools to explain where        125    00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:37.379    I'm from or why you wouldn't find me        126    00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:38.939    running by the Charles in the winter        127    00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:41.479    when no one is chasing me        128    00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.129    self-centered intellectual pursuit can        129    00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:46.729    get incredibly dissatisfying and        130    00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.149    ultimately lonely and so I began        131    00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:54.269    observing Americans instead away from        132    00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:56.159    the images that had for so long filled        133    00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.299    my head I promptly began my fieldwork        134    00:05:59.299 --> 00:06:02.639    outlining the rituals among American 20        135    00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.909    year olds their sociality their tribal        136    00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:08.939    customs and norms what they found taboo        137    00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:11.099    to talk about in public they're        138    00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:13.379    different kinship systems and values for        139    00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:16.739    concepts like personal space and how        140    00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:19.619    how's it going isn't actually a question        141    00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:22.159    about how it's going        142    00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:25.229    eventually I too began to participate in        143    00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.659    the natives rituals annual festivals        144    00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:30.059    like the Super Bowl and this        145    00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:32.339    collaborative activity that was creating        146    00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:35.489    a March Madness bracket I started        147    00:06:35.489 --> 00:06:37.739    watching American news as an empathy        148    00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:46.709    exercise really and slowly but surely my        149    00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:49.079    eyes began to open to certain realities        150    00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:51.329    about the American experience through        151    00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:54.869    the lens of Harvard class of 2019 that        152    00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:59.159    bring it on 1 2 & 3 could never have        153    00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:01.639    taught me not even in a million years        154    00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:04.019    there were experiences that brought us        155    00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:06.539    together as a community and reminded me        156    00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:09.769    of the universality of our experiences        157    00:07:09.769 --> 00:07:12.989    it was in the looks of all an amazement        158    00:07:12.989 --> 00:07:16.349    and chagrin for some when we witnessed        159    00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:18.779    Adams house rise like a phoenix from the        160    00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:21.119    ashes blessing us with what had to be        161    00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:25.159    the greatest housing video of all time        162    00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:28.619    it was in your faces        163    00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:31.739    every time you worried about the        164    00:07:31.739 --> 00:07:35.969    inequalities of your education system it        165    00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:39.029    was in your pain when another unarmed        166    00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:41.019    black man was shot        167    00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:44.509    it was in the face of an understaffed        168    00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:47.449    homeless shelter and an increasingly        169    00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:53.299    gentrifying town now I know Harvard is        170    00:07:53.299 --> 00:07:55.819    not representative of the entire United        171    00:07:55.819 --> 00:07:58.849    States in fact if anything this heavily        172    00:07:58.849 --> 00:08:01.429    endowed bubble is far from the reality        173    00:08:01.429 --> 00:08:04.699    faced by millions in this country but if        174    00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:06.709    there is anything I am thankful for it        175    00:08:06.709 --> 00:08:08.389    has been the opportunity to have been        176    00:08:08.389 --> 00:08:11.860    part of class of 2019 a class of strong        177    00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.169    talented beautiful smart ambitious young        178    00:08:15.169 --> 00:08:17.329    people who have shared with me little        179    00:08:17.329 --> 00:08:18.919    snippets of where they are from and        180    00:08:18.919 --> 00:08:22.069    where they hope to go and so at the end        181    00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:24.139    of this anthropological study I would        182    00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:26.179    like to share with you all my findings        183    00:08:26.179 --> 00:08:28.849    based on the statistical sample that has        184    00:08:28.849 --> 00:08:30.469    been my interactions with the class of        185    00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:34.219    2019 the most important of them being        186    00:08:34.219 --> 00:08:38.959    that people are people and joy is joy        187    00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:43.519    and pain is pain everywhere and we        188    00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:45.910    cannot limit ourselves to what we know        189    00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.290    based on where we come from        190    00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.850    in the same vein let it not be that this        191    00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.189    Harvard experience becomes our culture        192    00:08:55.189 --> 00:08:58.309    if you will that we get so attached to        193    00:08:58.309 --> 00:09:00.379    bleeding this crimson blood that we are        194    00:09:00.379 --> 00:09:02.300    so unwilling to step out and be        195    00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.490    challenged to learn something new or        196    00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.920    presently engaged when we encounter        197    00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.699    something or someone different        198    00:09:09.699 --> 00:09:11.930    statistically speaking those who have        199    00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.209    left these grounds have had a palpable        200    00:09:14.209 --> 00:09:16.639    impact in the world those who have gone        201    00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:19.149    ahead of us have disrupted culture        202    00:09:19.149 --> 00:09:21.759    transformed global politics        203    00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:25.040    revolutionized economies and we will        204    00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.529    most probably go ahead and do equally        205    00:09:27.529 --> 00:09:31.009    significant things if not more but these        206    00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:34.100    accolades these achievements do not make        207    00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.529    us any better our lives any more        208    00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:41.120    valuable or joy any more valid our anger        209    00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.850    any more justified than the man across        210    00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.370    the street for whom every dollar counts        211    00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:50.689    and this is in no way meant to devalue        212    00:09:50.689 --> 00:09:53.809    or worse if anything it takes away this        213    00:09:53.809 --> 00:09:54.240    press        214    00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.189    that we need to prove a point to the        215    00:09:56.189 --> 00:09:58.559    world that we need to prove that we went        216    00:09:58.559 --> 00:10:00.509    to Harvard and did enough with this        217    00:10:00.509 --> 00:10:04.860    opportunity class of 2019 you graduate        218    00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.470    from Harvard but you're worth so much        219    00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.399    more in and of yourself and so I employ        220    00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:13.379    you in the words of the great        221    00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:16.139    philosopher of our day Pulitzer Prize        222    00:10:16.139 --> 00:10:16.829    winner        223    00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:20.879    Kendrick Lamar sit down        224    00:10:20.879 --> 00:10:25.740    be humble humility not being defined by        225    00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.629    how much we downplay the power that        226    00:10:27.629 --> 00:10:30.720    comes with the name humility not being        227    00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.970    saying to those who ask that we went to        228    00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.660    a school in Boston but humility being        229    00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.240    the willingness to see all humanity as        230    00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.259    equal Harvard degree notwithstanding        231    00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:44.579    humility being the willingness to learn        232    00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:46.589    as much as we can about those different        233    00:10:46.589 --> 00:10:49.670    from us outside what we know and then        234    00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.439    using this Harvard degree too as we say        235    00:10:52.439 --> 00:10:55.529    in khumba do what we can with what we        236    00:10:55.529 --> 00:10:58.829    have to leave a space better than we        237    00:10:58.829 --> 00:11:02.490    found it the world is in need of more        238    00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.769    people who walk through life with this        239    00:11:04.769 --> 00:11:08.100    sense of wonder people courageous enough        240    00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.350    to engage that which is different or        241    00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.670    strange or even unacceptable        242    00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.929    willing enough to step out of what they        243    00:11:15.929 --> 00:11:18.089    think they know and humble enough to        244    00:11:18.089 --> 00:11:20.819    learn from each experience more than        245    00:11:20.819 --> 00:11:23.249    ever our generation needs leadership        246    00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:26.970    that is willing to love and serve within        247    00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:30.559    this rare blend of courage and humility        248    00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:33.559    courageous enough to secure the bag        249    00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:35.939    humble enough to do it without letting        250    00:11:35.939 --> 00:11:37.079    it define you        251    00:11:37.079 --> 00:11:40.709    it is my hope class of 2019 that he        252    00:11:40.709 --> 00:11:42.779    shall be said of us that we embodied        253    00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:45.769    this in the years to come thank you and        254    00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:48.769    congratulations        255

  give a shout-out to my fellow members of        14    00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.930    the class of 1969 so many of whom are        15    00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.370    here for our fiftieth anniversary we've        16    00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.129    had a lot of fun and of course I can't        17    00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.480    help but think back to the time fifty        18    00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.930    years ago when we sat in these very same        19    00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.689    seats when our country was going through        20    00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.220    it tumultuously and socially and there        21    00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.799    was public anger and outrage fueling        22    00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.790    activism and protests Harvard was        23    00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.280    steeped in the Vietnam War protests the        24    00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.210    administration building was occupied        25    00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.740    you've probably heard a great deal about        26    00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.869    some of those events with all of the        27    00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.659    remembrances on the anniversary but we        28    00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.200    had a president who floated the law was        29    00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.009    hostile to norms exploited division and        30    00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.670    hate our society and political dialogue        31    00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.290    were mired in tribalism and polarization        32    00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.810    and it's felt sometimes like the        33    00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.600    challenges would be really difficult to        34    00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.369    overcome but we did overcome them and        35    00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.130    it's useful to think back about that        36    00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.040    time because of the time we're in right        37    00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.259    now and I'm going to say a little bit        38    00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.629    about that in this talk but I do want to        39    00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:12.940    be        40    00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.650    by saying to your parents to your        41    00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.630    families to the faculty and staff but        42    00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.280    most of all to all of the members of        43    00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.560    this class congratulations this is a        44    00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.200    wonderful wonderful occasion and        45    00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.600    tomorrow will be as well and you know I        46    00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.720    was paying attention when Nicholas said        47    00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.750    there's always a popular vote in the        48    00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.430    electoral college and I I actually I        49    00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.470    actually think of the difference between        50    00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.540    class day and commencement in those        51    00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.690    terms there was a popular vote to select        52    00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.390    your speaker here today thank you very        53    00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:08.860    much but I can't give you your diplomas        54    00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.680    you've got to come back for the true        55    00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.100    authority on commencement tomorrow but        56    00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.690    congratulations to all of you the last        57    00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.580    time I spoke during commencement meat        58    00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.000    week at Harvard was 25 years ago I was        59    00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.670    vice president and someone asked me what        60    00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.730    is the best thing about being vice        61    00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.440    president I said well there's the great        62    00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.320    seal of the vice president of the United        63    00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.280    States and if you close one eye and turn        64    00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.510    your head just right it says president        65    00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.320    of the United States        66    00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:55.189    I want to say a few serious words today        67    00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.459    because you've given me an opportunity        68    00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.670    and an occasion to do so and again my        69    00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.980    deep deep gratitude veritas truth is not        70    00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.890    only Harvard's motto emblazoned on so        71    00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.720    many of these banners here today but it        72    00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.280    is also democracy's shield and the right        73    00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.859    to pursue truth is the most fundamental        74    00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.639    right of them all that right is now at        75    00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:32.270    risk and as a result freedom itself he        76    00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.220    is at risk more so now than it was 50        77    00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.800    years ago earlier this week one of my        78    00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.900    distinguished classmates robert post        79    00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.759    professor and longtime former dean at        80    00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.080    yale law school warned us that in        81    00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.630    America today we are witnessing what he        82    00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.660    called and I quote an attack on the        83    00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.370    authority of knowledge of course what we        84    00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.449    think of as knowledge is always based on        85    00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.370    our best efforts in the past to        86    00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.310    establish what is more likely than not        87    00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.150    to be true but it's inevitably combined        88    00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.510    with a legacy of accumulated error        89    00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.900    sanctified by repetition and we have        90    00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.180    learned that our constant asymptotic        91    00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.349    progress toward Veritas requires that        92    00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:33.680    reason be used to subject the authority        93    00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.190    of knowledge to continuous challenge it        94    00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.310    is our shared respect for the authority        95    00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.490    of what we accept mutually as knowledge        96    00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.250    that undergirds the principle that we        97    00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.669    are a nation of laws not men or women my        98    00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.979    faith tradition teaches you shall know        99    00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.139    the truth and the truth shall set you        100    00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.470    free and other traditions teach the same        101    00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.830    truth in other words faith in the power        102    00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.000    of reason the belief that free citizens        103    00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.480    can govern themselves wisely and fairly        104    00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.660    by resorting to logical debate on the        105    00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.920    basis of the best evidence available        106    00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.170    instead of on the basis of the exercise        107    00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.160    of raw power was M remains the central        108    00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.190    premise of American democracy and it is        109    00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.550    precisely that premise that is under        110    00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.990    assault in our country today the        111    00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.360    principle alternative to democracy        112    00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.030    throughout history has been the        113    00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.240    consolidation of virtually all state        114    00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.690    power in the hands of a single strong        115    00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.170    man who enlists a small group of hitmen        116    00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.950    to exercise power without the the        117    00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.780    informed consent of the governed it was        118    00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.000    in revolt against just such a regime        119    00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.330    after all that America was founded and        120    00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.940    when Abraham Lincoln declared at the        121    00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.980    time of America's greatest challenge        122    00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.040    that the ultimate question being decided        123    00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.140    in the Civil War was quote whether that        124    00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.290    nation or any nation so conceived and so        125    00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.760    dedicated can long endure he was not        126    00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.020    only saving our Union but he was also        127    00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.150    recognizing the fact that democracies        128    00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.050    are rare in history and they often do        129    00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.460    not last and when they fail as they did        130    00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.370    in Athens and the Roman Republic upon        131    00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.520    both of whose designs our founders drew        132    00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.610    heavily what emerges in their place is        133    00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.940    another strong man a dictator as the        134    00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.690    Romans called him with an aspiration to        135    00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.110    dominance which necessitates a constant        136    00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.200    focus on power        137    00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.860    what makes totalitarians and would-be        138    00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.710    totalitarians so profoundly dangerous is        139    00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.220    that their hunger for power        140    00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.400    leads them always to try to establish        141    00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.670    themselves as the final authority as to        142    00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.680    what is and is not accepted as knowledge        143    00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.800    they want to displace reason as the        144    00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.900    means to test ideas for their validity        145    00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.580    that is why throughout history they have        146    00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.800    so frequently labeled to the free press        147    00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.219    as the enemy of the people that is the        148    00:08:36.219 --> 00:08:39.450    meaning of the phrase alternative facts        149    00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.290    we often say no man is above the law        150    00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.940    although the US Justice Department's        151    00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.740    current policy carves out an exception        152    00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.310    to that principle for one and only one        153    00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:55.150    person we should also affirm that no        154    00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.670    person is the sole arbiter of the truth        155    00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.810    and two that there must be no exception        156    00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.000    however totalitarians seek to make        157    00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.510    themselves both above the law and the        158    00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:11.440    sole arbiter of truth that is why we        159    00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.440    hear threats today to prosecute as        160    00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.360    criminals those in our law enforcement        161    00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.210    agencies who have sought to protect our        162    00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:22.920    democracy supporters of authoritarianism        163    00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.930    define loyalty to America's core        164    00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.380    principles as treason against its new        165    00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.980    would be sovereign this explains the        166    00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.370    appeal to would-be autocrats of multiple        167    00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:40.360    bromances with extreme authoritarians at        168    00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.330    least one of whom in our current time        169    00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.490    has been allowed to sink his teeth into        170    00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:48.610    America's Democratic electoral process        171    00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.260    and play with it like a chew toy        172    00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.910    zealous would-be autocrats are also        173    00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.120    dangerous for our country because of        174    00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.580    their willingness to do serious damage        175    00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.460    to the structure and norms of our        176    00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.500    American democracy in order to satisfy        177    00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.010    their lust for domination of all three        178    00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.100    branches of government in order to enact        179    00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:16.120    their dogma as policy supporters of        180    00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.480    authoritarianism in America have long        181    00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.720    sought an all-powerful executive        182    00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.379    using a weakened and obsequious        183    00:10:25.379 --> 00:10:28.389    legislative branch to fashion a        184    00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:31.529    compliant judiciary in its own image        185    00:10:31.529 --> 00:10:33.879    they endeavor to break down the        186    00:10:33.879 --> 00:10:36.970    separation of powers and in place of the        187    00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:40.089    current system they seek to establish a        188    00:10:40.089 --> 00:10:44.170    system in which power is unified in the        189    00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.990    service of a narrower ideology serving a        190    00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.600    narrow set of interests it is truly        191    00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.199    power that is key to understanding the        192    00:10:53.199 --> 00:10:56.649    cynical manipulation of facts and the        193    00:10:56.649 --> 00:11:00.939    assault on reason Aristotle once wrote        194    00:11:00.939 --> 00:11:03.459    that virtue is one thing        195    00:11:03.459 --> 00:11:06.790    similarly respect for the rule of law is        196    00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.990    one thing it is indivisible and as long        197    00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.750    as it remains indivisible so will our        198    00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.949    country but if those making decisions in        199    00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:21.009    our democracy are ever so beguiled by a        200    00:11:21.009 --> 00:11:23.920    lust for power that they abandon this        201    00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.170    unifying principle then the fabric of        202    00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:30.399    our democracy will tear when the        203    00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:32.500    decision-making process is no longer        204    00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.959    dominated by reason it quickly becomes        205    00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:37.779    far more vulnerable to outcomes        206    00:11:37.779 --> 00:11:40.420    determined by the use of raw power and        207    00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.660    the temptation to corruption grows        208    00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.649    accordingly when reason and logic are        209    00:11:47.649 --> 00:11:50.189    removed from the process of democracy        210    00:11:50.189 --> 00:11:53.620    when there is no longer any seeming        211    00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.019    purpose in debating or discussing the        212    00:11:56.019 --> 00:11:58.930    choices we have to make then all the        213    00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.660    questions before us are reduced to a        214    00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.209    simple question who can exercise the        215    00:12:04.209 --> 00:12:08.439    most power in its rawest form the system        216    00:12:08.439 --> 00:12:10.870    of checks and balances that has        217    00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.059    protected the integrity of our American        218    00:12:13.059 --> 00:12:16.240    system for more than two centuries has        219    00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:21.129    already been dangerously eroded if dogma        220    00:12:21.129 --> 00:12:25.410    and cultish devotion to a strong man        221    00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:29.050    rush in to fill the vacuum left by        222    00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.350    reasons departure they allow for the        223    00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.019    exercise of new forms of power more        224    00:12:35.019 --> 00:12:36.730    arbitrary and less        225    00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.790    arrived from the consent of the governed        226    00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:43.839    in simple terms when fear and anxiety        227    00:12:43.839 --> 00:12:47.260    play a larger role in our society logic        228    00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.519    and reason play a diminished role in        229    00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:53.760    collective decision-making and        230    00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.769    unfortunately the new expressions of        231    00:12:56.769 --> 00:12:59.709    power that surface in such circumstances        232    00:12:59.709 --> 00:13:02.709    often spring from the deep poisoned        233    00:13:02.709 --> 00:13:07.139    wells of racism ultra-nationalism        234    00:13:07.139 --> 00:13:10.990    religious strife tribalism anti-semitism        235    00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:14.560    and Islamophobia sexism and misogyny        236    00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.300    homophobia and transphobia        237    00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.839    discrimination and abuse of the disabled        238    00:13:21.839 --> 00:13:25.839    would be autocrats ignore the warnings        239    00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:28.889    of their own experts forbid dissent and        240    00:13:28.889 --> 00:13:32.740    refuse to test assumptions against the        241    00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.720    best available evidence they demonstrate        242    00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.860    contempt for the basic tenets of        243    00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.170    rational decision-making defined as one        244    00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:44.350    in which an honest emphasis is placed on        245    00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.660    obtaining the best evidence and then        246    00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.420    letting good facts drive the good        247    00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.930    decisions instead the hallmarks of those        248    00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:56.410    who are drawn to authoritarianism is a        249    00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:00.310    systematic effort to manipulate facts in        250    00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:04.240    service to the strong man who advocates        251    00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.750    a totalizing ideology that's felt to be        252    00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.380    more important than the mandates of        253    00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:14.889    basic honesty it may be that the legacy        254    00:14:14.889 --> 00:14:18.190    of the 20th century's ideologically        255    00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.880    driven bloodbath has also included a new        256    00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.589    cynicism about reason itself because        257    00:14:26.589 --> 00:14:29.500    reason was so easily used by        258    00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.529    propagandists to disguise their impulse        259    00:14:32.529 --> 00:14:35.370    to power by cloaking it in clever and        260    00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.889    seductive intellectual formulations in        261    00:14:38.889 --> 00:14:42.459    an age of propaganda education itself        262    00:14:42.459 --> 00:14:45.640    can become suspect and that can lead        263    00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.699    would-be authoritarians to profess their        264    00:14:48.699 --> 00:14:49.860    love for those they        265    00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.120    all the poorly educated when ideology is        266    00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.930    woven into alleged facts and delivered        267    00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.970    and fully formed and self-contained        268    00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:03.120    packages people naturally begin to        269    00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.820    develop some cynicism about what they        270    00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:09.390    are being told when people are subjected        271    00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.660    to ubiquitous an unrelenting mass        272    00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.200    advertising reason and logic often begin        273    00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.600    to seem like they are no more than        274    00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.600    handmaidens in the constant selling        275    00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.810    process and when these same techniques        276    00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:27.269    dominate the political communication        277    00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:29.610    sent by candidates to voters the        278    00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.550    integrity of our democracy is placed        279    00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.269    under the same cloud of suspicion and        280    00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:39.360    now social media with its filter bubbles        281    00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.140    driven by surveillance capitalism        282    00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.810    enhances cynicism and magnifies        283    00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:48.630    divisions moreover when middle-income        284    00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:51.120    families have seen virtually no increase        285    00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.390    in take-home pay for more than 40 years        286    00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.699    while the wealthiest have become        287    00:15:56.699 --> 00:15:59.670    wealthier still an inequality has risen        288    00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.850    to levels profoundly dangerous to        289    00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.519    egalitarianism and American democracy it        290    00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:09.000    is no wonder that self professed experts        291    00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.640    are regarded with more cynicism than        292    00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.810    ever so this is also the meaning of the        293    00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:20.010    present assault on science science which        294    00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:22.440    is now being cynically slandered as a        295    00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.709    conspiracy based on a hoax the        296    00:16:25.709 --> 00:16:27.750    subordination of the best scientific        297    00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.870    evidence to the cynical greed of those        298    00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:33.240    buttressing the power of a would-be        299    00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.620    autocrat is yet another strategy for        300    00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.070    controlling policy by distorting and        301    00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.480    suppressing the best available        302    00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:47.180    information so the ideology of        303    00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.790    authoritarianism is now not only a        304    00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:55.079    threat to democracy in America now        305    00:16:55.079 --> 00:16:57.329    because of the attacks on climate        306    00:16:57.329 --> 00:17:01.000    science it has become a threat        307    00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.209    to the survival of human civilization as        308    00:17:04.209 --> 00:17:07.030    we know it and even potentially to the        309    00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.000    capacity of the human species to endure        310    00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.079    I learned about climate science as a        311    00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:17.980    student here in this university from a        312    00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.110    great scientist and teacher named Roger        313    00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:21.880    Revelle who designed the first        314    00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.610    experiments to measure the accumulation        315    00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:29.049    of co2 in the Earth's atmosphere I went        316    00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:32.350    by the way to the 100th birthday the        317    00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.179    commemoration of the 100th anniversary        318    00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:37.150    of his birth and learned in my research        319    00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:40.690    it's me to wonder how many chains of        320    00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:44.080    inspiration stretched back in time and        321    00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.799    as you in the class of 2019 think about        322    00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:50.400    the professors who have inspired you        323    00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.380    carry with you an obligation to conduct        324    00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.260    yourselves as citizen leaders of our        325    00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:00.510    society in ways that will inspire others        326    00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:04.450    we have to restore the role of reason        327    00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:09.460    and logic and rational debate Thomas        328    00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.530    Jefferson would have recognized the        329    00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.809    linkage between the absence of reason        330    00:18:13.809 --> 00:18:16.390    and the emergence of absurd and        331    00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:20.169    dangerous tragedy as he wrote to James        332    00:18:20.169 --> 00:18:24.460    Smith in 1822 and I quote man once        333    00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.950    surrendering his reason has no remaining        334    00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:29.799    guard against absurdities the most        335    00:18:29.799 --> 00:18:32.919    monstrous and like a ship without rudder        336    00:18:32.919 --> 00:18:38.890    is the sport of every wind speaking of        337    00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:39.490    wind        338    00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:42.880    the winds are increasingly destructive        339    00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.520    in our world        340    00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.380    yesterday was the 13th day in a row when        341    00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.260    multiple tornadoes touched down in the        342    00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:54.280    United States 500 this month hurricanes        343    00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.820    have become much stronger today the        344    00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.070    Arkansas River is four feet higher than        345    00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.860    the all-time record flood states the        346    00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.440    Mississippi River is setting records as        347    00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.630    the longest flood ever thirty-nine        348    00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:11.140    million Americans today are at risk from        349    00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.059    flooding every night on the television        350    00:19:13.059 --> 00:19:14.860    news is like a nature        351    00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:18.130    through the Book of Revelations and the        352    00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:21.190    cause is very clear the scientists have        353    00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:25.360    told us we are putting 110 million tons        354    00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.630    of man-made heat trapping global warming        355    00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.779    pollution into the sky every day as if        356    00:19:31.779 --> 00:19:34.720    it is an open sewer and the accumulated        357    00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.539    quantity now traps as much extra heat        358    00:19:37.539 --> 00:19:41.460    energy every day as would be released by        359    00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.490    500 Hiroshima sized atomic bombs        360    00:19:44.490 -->

00:20:29.409    living species with which we share this        375    00:20:29.409 --> 00:20:35.380    planet in this century on our watch so        376    00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.460    I'm here in response to your invitation        377    00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.139    grateful for the opportunity to speak        378    00:20:41.139 --> 00:20:43.539    with you but I am also here to recruit        379    00:20:43.539 --> 00:20:49.929    you we have work to do all of us we must        380    00:20:49.929 --> 00:20:53.019    see the seriousness and historic nature        381    00:20:53.019 --> 00:20:55.950    of this challenge        382    00:20:56.110 --> 00:21:01.210    and I tell you that there is an        383    00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:03.760    abundance not only of danger but an        384    00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.809    abundance of hope we are seeing        385    00:21:06.809 --> 00:21:10.320    surprising even startling and historic        386    00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.789    advances in the technologies of        387    00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:15.130    renewable energy the cost of electricity        388    00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.830    from solar and wind has been plummeting        389    00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:21.250    so fast that it is now cheaper in most        390    00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.769    geographies around this world than        391    00:21:23.769 --> 00:21:26.429    electricity from burning fossil fuels        392    00:21:26.429 --> 00:21:29.590    electric vehicles are increasing in        393    00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.200    number and popularity batteries are        394    00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.590    becoming much more affordable        395    00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.260    regenerative agriculture is replacing        396    00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.409    the industrial and factory models of the        397    00:21:41.409 --> 00:21:43.779    past not quickly enough but it is        398    00:21:43.779 --> 00:21:46.000    happening sustainable forestry and        399    00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.950    circular manufacturing must be adopted        400    00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.630    the fastest growing job in the United        401    00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.870    States of America is solar installer for        402    00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.630    the last 5 years it has grown six times        403    00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.419    faster than all other jobs the second        404    00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:03.820    fastest growing job is wind turbine        405    00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.330    technician fossil fuels can no longer        406    00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.490    compete the largest sovereign wealth        407    00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:11.919    fund in the world in Norway financed        408    00:22:11.919 --> 00:22:14.470    completely by olan gas revenues has        409    00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:16.840    started divesting from fossil fuels and        410    00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.630    so should Harvard University        411    00:22:25.829 --> 00:22:31.229    that is one of the remaining challenges        412    00:22:31.229 --> 00:22:35.429    for this University        413    00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.380    I want to make it clear this is a moral        414    00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:48.370    issue it was immoral to continue        415    00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:51.850    investing in apartheid in the 1980s when        416    00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.950    I was in the United States Senate the        417    00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.200    student activists of that day at Harvard        418    00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.070    recruited me to run as one of their        419    00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.800    candidates as a candidate for the Board        420    00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.910    of Overseers        421    00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:06.490    in order to help push the university        422    00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.550    past its resistance to divest of        423    00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:13.030    apartheid stocks and stop supporting        424    00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:16.330    that racist system in South Africa now        425    00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.670    fortunately the student activists        426    00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.920    recruited someone else to run with me on        427    00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.310    that ticket Archbishop Desmond Tutu so I        428    00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:27.130    did not have to do much heavy lifting        429    00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:30.990    but the university did respond as they        430    00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:34.000    responded when they realized it was        431    00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.990    immoral to invest in tobacco stocks well        432    00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:40.750    let me tell you that the the oil        433    00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:43.570    companies and the gas and coal companies        434    00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:46.600    today have been following the same        435    00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.480    strategy innovated by the tobacco        436    00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.660    companies years ago when they decided to        437    00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.330    undermine the authority of knowledge        438    00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:58.510    they wrote in a famous phrase and I        439    00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:01.030    quote from the tobacco industry        440    00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:04.390    documents doubt is our product since it        441    00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:07.000    is the best means of competing with the        442    00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.850    body of fact that exists in the mind of        443    00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:12.730    the general public the fossil fuel        444    00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.670    companies adopted the same playbook the        445    00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:19.650    same strategy hired many of the same PR        446    00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:24.250    strategists and and technicians last        447    00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:26.710    week another new study found that our        448    00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.960    country has a much higher percentage of        449    00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.360    people who denied the climate crisis is        450    00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.300    real than any other nation and it's no        451    00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.900    wonder why because they have been the        452    00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.970    American people have been the targets of        453    00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:43.720    a massive well organised and lavishly        454    00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.770    funded campaign of disinformation        455    00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:50.800    designed to spread doubt and confusion        456    00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.500    and prevent the formation of a        457    00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.560    political consensus necessary to adopt        458    00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.220    new policies to save the future of human        459    00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.400    civilization        460    00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.060    why would Harvard University continue to        461    00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.300    support with its finances an industry        462    00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.850    like this that is in the process of        463    00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:14.740    threatening the future of humanity        464    00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:28.620    ladies and gentlemen we have to change        465    00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.540    we cannot continue on our present course        466    00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:35.050    and in order to solve the climate crisis        467    00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:39.460    we must solve the democracy crisis so I        468    00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:43.210    said earlier I'm here to recruit you but        469    00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:46.630    I want to close by underscoring the        470    00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:50.860    existence of an abundance of hope we        471    00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:54.310    have to change but we can change we have        472    00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:57.250    the ability to change and the obstacles        473    00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:01.630    to change can be overcome but it will        474    00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:05.950    require a decision on the part of you in        475    00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:09.610    this graduating class and all of those        476    00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.580    who are part of your networks of family        477    00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.610    and friends to decide that it is        478    00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:19.150    important enough to do but do not give        479    00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:23.710    up hope just as apartheid was ended just        480    00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:26.470    as the civil rights movement profoundly        481    00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:28.780    changed this country even though much        482    00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.960    more change is needed just as women's        483    00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.360    suffrage was finally achieved even        484    00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.570    though much more must be done just as        485    00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:40.690    gay and lesbian rights have now finally        486    00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:43.030    reached the point that gay marriage is        487    00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.400    legal and accepted and celebrated and        488    00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.610    supported in all 50 states of the United        489    00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:50.520    States many thought that would never        490    00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:56.470    occur it would not be possible but all        491    00:26:56.470 --> 00:27:00.280    of these reforms were achieved when the        492    00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.470    underbrush was cleared away to reveal        493    00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:05.440    the central choice between what is right        494    00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.740    and what is wrong and when that central        495    00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.500    choice is thus revealed the outcome is        496    00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.740    for ordained because of who we are as        497    00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:18.700    human beings I refuse to believe that we        498    00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.250    as human beings do not have a sufficient        499    00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:24.040    capacity to make changes of the        500    00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.830    magnitude that are now necessary to save        501    00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:29.230    our future and if you doubt for one        502    00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:30.539    moment        503    00:27:30.539 --> 00:27:33.659    that we do have the ability to change or        504    00:27:33.659 --> 00:27:35.879    the will to change please always        505    00:27:35.879 --> 00:27:39.029    remember that the will to change is        506    00:27:39.029

00:01:27.540    just one story that there are a few of        30    00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.000    my closest friends have ever heard and        31    00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.820    while I look like Tanya I hope that by        32    00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.860    the time I'm done you'll understand what        33    00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.710    motivated me to apply to the school what        34    00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.329    motivated me to ensure the rigors of the        35    00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.250    program and what motivates me to stand        36    00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.280    here and give this speech today in the        37    00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.770    process        38    00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.859    to forty years ago I survived the Indian        39    00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.950    Ocean tsunami the same suit not really        40    00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.819    killed a quarter of a million people a        41    00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.000    December 26 2004 I was scuba diving        42    00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.740    wouldn't make father that dynastar -        43    00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.630    named Johan through sunken ferry wreck        44    00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.860    on the bottom the Indian Ocean as we        45    00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.660    swam down the wrecks cargo bay we        46    00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.830    noticed the temperament water had        47    00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.590    dropped now that was the water cooling        48    00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.750    but it also started shutting the curtain        49    00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.950    appeared out of nowhere        50    00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.390    picked up Senate from the ocean floor        51    00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.049    and mixed it in with the tropical water        52    00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.790    just moments before we have been able to        53    00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.650    see the bottom of our dike boat floating        54    00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.500    80 feet above us but its silhouette was        55    00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.610    obscured by cold brown haze as we        56    00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.560    continued swimming conditions        57    00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.750    deteriorated the temperature plummeted        58    00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.420    close to freezing and we realized we        59    00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.470    wouldn't be able to fight the current        60    00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.410    for much longer        61    00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.569    luckily justice began to overwhelm us we        62    00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.730    found safety in an alcove on the outside        63    00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.430    of the record but almost as soon as we        64    00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.380    arrived the full brunt of the studentís        65    00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.739    truck to this day another exactly how I        66    00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:01.160    felt        67    00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.889    It was as if a hand reached down with        68    00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.920    the depths of the ocean cracking and as        69    00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.410    it ripped me away from the alcove I saw        70    00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.530    the dim outlines my father yo        71    00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.230    disappeared to darkness and for millions        72    00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.640    I wonder they would be the last thing I        73    00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.870    ever saw but justice ripped me away        74    00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.940    another any hit in the curtain reverse        75    00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.510    itself        76    00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.270    I saw the shadows of my father don't        77    00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.520    grow larger as I slammed headfirst into        78    00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.230    the side of the wreck and then        79    00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.730    everything went black as I was knocked        80    00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.700    unconscious bones later I came to to        81    00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.500    find Yohan clinging to the back of my        82    00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.750    dive tank is the two of us rocking along        83    00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.130    the ocean floor away from the rack just        84    00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.410    feet below me I can see seaweed passing        85    00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.110    by and in my day State of Mind I        86    00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.459    remember thinking about like watching        87    00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.170    the bushes pass along the side of the        88    00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.610    highway a few minutes past the curtain        89    00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.560    subsided to the point where Johanna and        90    00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.020    I felt comforting up he then released        91    00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.640    his emergency beacon the two of us        92    00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.020    ascended to the service alone on the few        93    00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.970    occasions I've told this story the        94    00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.610    Alaskans are scared and the truth is I        95    00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.310    wasn't but yes        96    00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.290    is anyone who has seen me screaming in        97    00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.630    the sign of B can tell you my lack of        98    00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.180    fear was not driven by bravery the        99    00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.890    sequence of events just happened too        100    00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.490    quickly for my mind to process 20        101    00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.290    minutes after Johann and I reach the        102    00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.090    sink in the dike boat we found my father        103    00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.490    swimming a half-mile away        104    00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.229    he had some minor injuries but was also        105    00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.800    somehow ok and unable to come in what        106    00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.330    happens we assume that we had witnessed        107    00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.300    three isolated incidents in fact by        108    00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.190    dialog I jokingly broke down the        109    00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.080    conditions as being more text of death        110    00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.270    which at the time seemed like a funny        111    00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.229    joke but the seriousness of what could        112    00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.000    happen quickly became apparent we        113    00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.990    returned to plant the other they're        114    00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.789    staying on was featured on the front        115    00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.860    cover of the New York Times because of        116    00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.400    the severity of the destruction that day        117    00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.770    over seventy percent of its three        118    00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.879    thousand inhabitants were killed over        119    00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:15.979    the course of the following week I saw        120    00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:17.690    bodies piling up on beaches        121    00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.000    I saw families searching for loved ones        122    00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.379    and I saw victims swarming overflowing        123    00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:26.750    transport ships as they tried to escape        124    00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.830    the end        125    00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.050    [Applause]        126    00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.490    I'm not comfortable going to detail        127    00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.580    about any of it suffice it to say that        128    00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.030    what I saw that we've changed me forever        129    00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.870    that week I learned that life is        130    00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.139    fleeting and that a moon can be our last        131    00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.469    so myself or just a good life for me a        132    00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:47.360    good life is working as an engineer        133    00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.270    outside of Buffalo but great something        134    00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.190    like a diving product is a different        135    00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.380    life altogether and to be clear I        136    00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.120    haven't achieved it yet but every single        137    00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.880    day I take one step closer and that is        138    00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.080    what what are they do need to apply to        139    00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.560    Harvard        140    00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.900    it's what motivated me to work ten hours        141    00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.060    a day then go home        142    00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.160    it compelled me to make sacrifices to        143    00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.290    pay for tuition we may give up all hope        144    00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.090    of having a normal social life is the        145    00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.580    last two years and I know that this        146    00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.169    journey isn't something that I alone        147    00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.720    experienced each of you is sitting        148    00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.580    yesterday because something happened in        149    00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.720    your life that motivated you to apply it        150    00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.860    would have maybe you to talk about        151    00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.840    personal obligations work and school        152    00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.680    simultaneously maybe your experience        153    00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.039    isn't as dramatic and I certainly hope        154    00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:37.039    it's less tragic but each of us has        155    00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:38.570    reasons for wanting to achieve        156    00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.080    everything that we are capable I        157    00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.130    encourage you to think of that reason        158    00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.710    they keep in the back of your mind        159    00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.050    because if you always remember it it        160    00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.400    will be when you continue to achieve        161    00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.740    great things but for today let's take a        162    00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.830    brief pause if thanks to those that        163    00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.169    helped us get here and celebrate our        164    00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:02.080    Harbor congratulations        165    00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.550    [Applause]        166    00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.280    [Music]

   6    00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.189    congratulations to you and to all your        7    00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.989    loved ones who are here        8    00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.829    I spent a wonderful year at the        9    00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.600    Radcliffe Institute here at Harvard        10    00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.219    doing a fellowship in 2011 and I fell in        11    00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.149    love with Cambridge        12    00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.950    and so it's very good to be back my name        13    00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.030    is Chimamanda in Ybor it means my        14    00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.750    personal spirit will never be broken I'm        15    00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.359    not sure why but some people find it        16    00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.519    difficult to pronounce a few years ago I        17    00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.220    spoke at an event in London the English        18    00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.400    woman who was to introduce me had        19    00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.650    written my name phonetically on a piece        20    00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.130    of paper and backstage she held on        21    00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.979    tightly to this paper while repeating        22    00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.670    the pronunciation over and over I could        23    00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.159    tell she was very eager to get it right        24    00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.670    and then she went out to the stage and        25    00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.579    gave a lovely introduction and ended        26    00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.400    with the words ladies and gentlemen        27    00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.890    please welcome chimichenga        28    00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.970    I told I told the story at a dinner        29    00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.760    party shortly afterwards and one of the        30    00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.550    guests seemed very annoyed that I was        31    00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.140    laughing about it that was so insulting        32    00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.840    he said that English woman could have        33    00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.640    tried harder but the truth is she did        34    00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.780    try very hard        35    00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.810    in fact she ended up calling me a fried        36    00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.960    burrito because she had tried very hard        37    00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.870    and then ended up with an utterly human        38    00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.460    mistake that was the result of anxiety        39    00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.800    so the point of this story is not to say        40    00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.880    that you can call me chimichanga the        41    00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.390    point is that intent matters that        42    00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.370    context matters        43    00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.410    somebody might very well call me        44    00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.530    chimichanga out of a malicious desire to        45    00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.020    mock my name and that I would certainly        46    00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.450    not laugh about but there is a        47    00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.550    difference between malice and a mistake        48    00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.950    we now live in a culture of calling out        49    00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.550    a culture of outrage and you should call        50    00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.489    people out you should be outraged        51    00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.630    but always remember context and never        52    00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.390    disregard intent if I were asked the        53    00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.180    title of my address to you today I would        54    00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:19.290    say above all else do not lie or don't        55    00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.370    like too often which is really to say        56    00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.769    tell the truth but lying the word the        57    00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.930    idea the act has such political potency        58    00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.050    in America today but it somehow feels        59    00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.709    more apt above all else do not lie I        60    00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.959    grew up in Nigeria through military        61    00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.370    dictatorships and through incipient        62    00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.480    democracies and America always felt        63    00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.970    aspirational        64    00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.480    when yet another absurd thing happened        65    00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.290    politically we would say this can never        66    00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.160    happen in America        67    00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.310    but today the political discourse in        68    00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.040    America includes questions that are        69    00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.720    straight from the land of the absurd        70    00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.959    questions such as should we call a lie a        71    00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.620    lie when is a lie a lie        72    00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:30.070    and so class of 2018 at no time has it        73    00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.520    felt as agent as now that we must        74    00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.770    protect and value the truth before I        75    00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.980    tell you about not lying I must first        76    00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.460    admit        77    00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.630    so before I tell you about not lying I        78    00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.560    must first admit to lying I routinely        79    00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.410    lie about my height even at the doctor's        80    00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.580    office in Lagos when I'm meeting friends        81    00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.680    for lunch I lie about being stuck in        82    00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.630    traffic when I'm really still at home        83    00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.290    only just getting dressed now there are        84    00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.190    other lies sadly however I cannot tell        85    00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.710    you about them without having to kill        86    00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.450    you afterwards but what I know is that I        87    00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.570    have always felt my best and done my        88    00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.600    best when I fear toward truth when I        89    00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.600    don't lie and the biggest regrets of my        90    00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.540    life of those times when I did not have        91    00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.770    the courage to embrace the truth now        92    00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.540    tell you the truth does not mean that        93    00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.490    everything will work out        94    00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.180    actually it sometimes doesn't I'm not        95    00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.520    asking you to tell the truth because it        96    00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.730    will always work out but because you        97    00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.480    will sleep well at night and there is        98    00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.300    nothing more beautiful than to wake up        99    00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.730    every day holding in your hand        100    00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:08.030    the full measure of your integrity many        101    00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.100    years ago before my first novel was        102    00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.410    published I attended a Writers        103    00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.500    Conference here in the US it was a        104    00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.800    gathering of many aspiring writers and a        105    00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.730    few established writers now the former        106    00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.360    there sparrin writers sucking up to the        107    00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.330    latter the established writers was a        108    00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.320    revered ritual of the conference and so        109    00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.410    during one of the breaks I walked up to        110    00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.560    a man and established writer whose name        111    00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.680    I knew well but whose work I had not        112    00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.040    read I shook his hand and told him what        113    00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:52.580    a fan I was I love your work I said his        114    00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.750    wife was sitting next to him so which of        115    00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.890    his books have you read she asked and I        116    00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.180    froze which had        117    00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.350    you read she asked again everyone at the        118    00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.150    table was quiet watching waiting I        119    00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.710    smiled a mad smile and I mumbled the one        120    00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.740    about the one about the man discovering        121    00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.419    himself which of course was complete        122    00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:27.720     but I thought it might be        123    00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.479    convincing since that kind of describes        124    00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:35.150    half of all the novels written by men        125    00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:41.270    and then I fled but before I fled I        126    00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.610    heard the writer say to his wife honey        127    00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.690    you shouldn't have done that        128    00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.449    but the truth is that I shouldn't have        129    00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:52.430    done that        130    00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.650    to read a novel is to give honor to art        131    00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.560    why lie about giving honor to something        132    00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.949    to which you have not I was of course        133    00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:05.009    absolutely mortified that day but I have        134    00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:07.530    come to respect what that writers wife        135    00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:14.000    had a fantastic detector and        136    00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.979    now that I have the good fortune of        137    00:08:16.979 --> 00:08:20.070    being an established writer one who does        138    00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.169    not like to miss an opportunity to        139    00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:25.979    wallow in praise by the way I can sense        140    00:08:25.979 --> 00:08:28.650    when a person is saying empty words and        141    00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.320    it feels much worse than if they had        142    00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.190    said nothing at all so have a good        143    00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.740     detector if you don't have it        144    00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.459    now walk on it but having that detector        145    00:08:41.459 --> 00:08:43.260    means that you must also use it on        146    00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.620    yourself and sometimes the hardest        147    00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.740    truths are those we have to tell        148    00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:54.300    ourselves when I first started sending        149    00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.339    out my early writing to agents and        150    00:08:56.339 --> 00:08:57.980    publishers and started getting        151    00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.230    rejections I convinced myself that my        152    00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:05.240    walk had simply not found the right home        153    00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.190    which might have been true but there was        154    00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.770    another truth that took me much longer        155    00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:14.430    to consider that the manuscript was not        156    00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:15.529    very good        157    00:09:15.529 --> 00:09:18.620    and in fact the first novel I wrote or        158    00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.100    what I thought was a novel eventually        159    00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.019    needed to be put away in a drawer and        160    00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:26.300    I'm so grateful that it was never        161    00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.749    published it is hard to tell ourselves        162    00:09:29.749 --> 00:09:32.410    the truth about our failures our        163    00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:36.170    fragilities our uncertainties it is hard        164    00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.839    to tell ourselves that maybe we haven't        165    00:09:38.839 --> 00:09:42.740    done the best that we can it is hard to        166    00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.680    tell ourselves the truth of our emotions        167    00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.220    that may be what we feel is hurt        168    00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.639    rather than anger that maybe it is time        169    00:09:52.639 --> 00:09:54.709    to close the chapter of a relationship        170    00:09:54.709 --> 00:09:59.569    and walk away and yet when we do we are        171    00:09:59.569 --> 00:10:04.790    the better off for it I understand that        172    00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.550    the Harvard College mission calls on you        173    00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.480    to be citizen leaders I don't even know        174    00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.559    what citizen leader means it sort of        175    00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:19.309    sounds like a Harvard Graduate saying I        176    00:10:19.309 --> 00:10:24.829    went to college in Boston which by the        177    00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:28.160    way has to be the most immodest form of        178    00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:35.059    modesty please class of 2018 when you        179    00:10:35.059 --> 00:10:38.029    asked where you went to college just say        180    00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:40.790    Harvard        181    00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:46.630    [Applause]        182    00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:50.389    by the way by the way I went to Yale for        183    00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:53.870    graduate school not New Haven which has        184    00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.649    other universities but we also know that        185    00:10:57.649 --> 00:11:01.250    in the grand snobbery sweepstakes of        186    00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.769    prestigious American colleges grad        187    00:11:03.769 --> 00:11:06.920    school doesn't really count its        188    00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.529    undergrad that counts so it's entirely        189    00:11:09.529 --> 00:11:11.449    possible that I don't even know how all        190    00:11:11.449 --> 00:11:15.470    of this works so you're charged to be        191    00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.810    citizen leaders which I suppose means        192    00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.230    that you're charged to be leaders I        193    00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.209    often wonder who will be led if everyone        194    00:11:23.209 --> 00:11:27.790    is supposed to be a leader but whether        195    00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.800    but whether you are a leader or whether        196    00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.430    you are the lead I urge you always to        197    00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:38.589    bend toward truth to err on the side of        198    00:11:38.589 --> 00:11:43.160    truth and to help you do this make        199    00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.540    literature your religion which is to say        200    00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.230    read widely read fiction and poetry and        201    00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.230    narrative nonfiction make the human        202    00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.449    story the center of your understanding        203    00:11:56.449 --> 00:12:01.060    of the world think of people as people        204    00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.070    not as abstractions who have to conform        205    00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:08.890    to bloodless logic but as people fragile        206    00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:12.140    imperfect with prides that can be        207    00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.640    wounded and hearts that can be touched        208    00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.370    literature is my religion I have learned        209    00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.829    from literature that we humans are        210    00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:25.010    flawed all of us are flawed but even        211    00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.949    while flawed we are capable of enduring        212    00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:30.860    goodness we do not need first to be        213    00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.410    perfect before we can do what is right        214    00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:38.240    and just and you have a class of 2018        215    00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.990    are not unfamiliar with speaking the        216    00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.300    truth when you stood alongside        217    00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.959    dining-hall walkers during the strike        218    00:12:46.959 --> 00:12:51.380    when you protest at the end of daca when        219    00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.060    you supported the black lives matter        220    00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.420    movement you were speaking the truth        221    00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.030    about the dignity        222    00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:02.410    that every single human being deserves I        223    00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:07.520    applaud you I urge you to continue        224    00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:14.960    [Applause]        225    00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:19.520    but remember that now outside the cocoon        226    00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.190    of Harvard the consequences will be        227    00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:26.450    greater the stakes will be higher please        228    00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.340    don't let that stop you from telling the        229    00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.890    truth sometimes especially in        230    00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.830    politicized spaces telling the truth        231    00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:38.470    will be an act of courage be courageous        232    00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.330    never set out to provoke for the sake of        233    00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:45.110    provoking but never silence yourself out        234    00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.290    of fear that a truth you speak might        235    00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:52.520    provoke be courageous people can be        236    00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.340    remarkably resistant to the facts that        237    00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.620    they do not like but don't let that        238    00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.770    silence you from speaking the truth be        239    00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.080    courageous be courageous enough to        240    00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.450    acknowledge that even if there is no        241    00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.110    value in the position of the other side        242    00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.090    there is value in knowing what that        243    00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:15.410    position is listen to the other side at        244    00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:19.940    least the reasonable other side be        245    00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.830    courageous enough to acknowledge that        246    00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:25.520    democracy is always fragile and that        247    00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.430    justice has nothing to do with the        248    00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:32.510    political left or the political right be        249    00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.460    courageous enough to recognize those        250    00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.560    things that get in the way of telling        251    00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.880    the truth the empty cleverness the        252    00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.210    morally bankrupt irony the desire to        253    00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:48.440    please the deliberate of fuchsine the        254    00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.500    tendency to confuse cynicism for        255    00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:55.270    sophistication be courageous enough to        256    00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:59.150    accept that life is messy your life will        257    00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.810    not always perfectly match your ideology        258    00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:05.450    sometimes even your choices will not        259    00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.750    align with your ideology don't justify        260    00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.290    and rationalize it acknowledge it        261    00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:14.420    because it is in trying to justify that        262    00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.260    we get into that twisting dark unending        263    00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.720    tunnel of lies from which it is        264    00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.060    sometimes impossible to re-emerge halt        265    00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.649    be courageous enough to say        266    00:15:27.649 --> 00:15:31.910    I don't know this might be harder to do        267    00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:36.170    with everyone calling you Harvard but        268    00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.860    ignorant acknowledged is an opportunity        269    00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.889    ignorant denied is a closed door and it        270    00:15:42.889 --> 00:15:45.740    takes courage to admit to the truth of        271    00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:50.600    what you do not know some people think        272    00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.059    that Harvard is the best school in the        273    00:15:53.059 --> 00:15:58.550    world personally I'm not so sure I need        274    00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:00.350    to know what my people like Yale think        275    00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:04.759    about that but I do know that for many        276    00:16:04.759 --> 00:16:07.160    people all over the world Harvard has        277    00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.399    become much more than just a school        278    00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:13.160    Harvard is a metaphor for untouchable        279    00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.970    intellectual achievement and now that        280    00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.670    you are Harvard graduates        281    00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.100    well actually almost Harvard graduates        282    00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.800    you don't actually have your degrees you        283    00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.420    wouldn't get them until tomorrow and I        284    00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.220    suppose there is still time for the        285    00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.230    Harvard administration folks to change        286    00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.290    their minds about giving it to you but        287    00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.389    assuming they don't change their minds        288    00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:37.459    and you do get your degrees tomorrow and        289    00:16:37.459 --> 00:16:40.579    become Harvard graduates the world will        290    00:16:40.579 --> 00:16:43.639    make assumptions about you many of them        291    00:16:43.639 --> 00:16:47.209    will be to your benefit such as the        292    00:16:47.209 --> 00:16:48.740    assumption of competence and        293    00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.589    intelligence employers will pay        294    00:16:51.589 --> 00:16:54.079    attention to your resume when they see        295    00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:57.199    Harvard on it but there will be other        296    00:16:57.199 --> 00:17:00.050    assumptions people who don't know        297    00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.089    anything about you except that you went        298    00:17:02.089 --> 00:17:04.339    to Harvard will assume that you feel        299    00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:08.500    superior that you think you're all that        300    00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.240    they will roll their eyes when you make        301    00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.350    a normal human mistake you might here at        302    00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:17.360    some point in your life in a tool that        303    00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.390    cannot be described as nice        304    00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:24.500    there goes Harvard now full disclosure a        305    00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.750    friend once told me that the only thing        306    00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.149    he learned at Harvard was to behave like        307    00:17:29.149 --> 00:17:32.600    a person who went to Harvard and I have        308    00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.340    often repeated that story quite        309    00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:39.830    gleefully so you will inspire resentment        310    00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.450    and hopefully        311    00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:43.220    that will help you keep in mind the        312    00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.980    humanity of everyone including the        313    00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.669    privileged but these are some shuns that        314    00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:52.419    people will make about you and minuscule        315    00:17:52.419 --> 00:17:55.490    compared to the enormous privilege that        316    00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:58.669    comes with a Harvard degree you now have        317    00:17:58.669 --> 00:18:02.480    a certain kind of access a certain kind        318    00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.529    of power and I know it is terribly        319    00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:08.539    cliched to say that you must now use        320    00:18:08.539 --> 00:18:11.870    this power to change the world but        321    00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:14.510    really you must now use this power to        322    00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.260    change the world        323    00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:24.870    [Applause]        324    00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.940    change a slice of the world no matter        325    00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.909    how small if you feel a sense of        326    00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:32.970    dissatisfaction with the status quo        327    00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:36.100    nurture that dissatisfaction be        328    00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.150    propelled by your dissatisfaction act        329    00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.950    get into the system and change the        330    00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:45.940    system challenge the steel assumptions        331    00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.520    that undergird so many of America's        332    00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.679    cultural institutions tell new stories        333    00:18:52.679 --> 00:18:55.720    champion new storytellers because the        334    00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.230    truth is that the universal does not        335    00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.860    belong to any one group of people        336    00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.450    everybody's story is potentially        337    00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:08.429    universal it just needs to be told well        338    00:19:08.429 --> 00:19:12.370    change the media in America make it        339    00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:16.570    about truth not about entertainment not        340    00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:21.240    about profit-making but about        341    00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.830    and and while you're doing it be astute        342    00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.450    about when you need balance and when you        343    00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:38.950    don't because sometimes seeking balance        344    00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.830    gets in the way of telling the truth if        345    00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.860    you're reporting about the Sun rising in        346    00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.260    the east you do not need to hear the        347    00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.690    other side because there is no real        348    00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:59.770    other side a Harvard degree will give        349    00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:03.400    you access and opportunities but sadly I        350    00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.230    have to inform you that it will not make        351    00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:09.130    you invincible you still have that        352    00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:12.340    fragile human core at the center of all        353    00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.880    of us there will be times when you are        354    00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.700    petrified of failing when fear of        355    00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.960    failure holds you back in those moments        356    00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.380    here is the truth that is easy to forget        357    00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.090    you don't actually know that you will        358    00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:33.190    fail I was lucky to be given a great        359    00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.830    gift by the universe knowing from        360    00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:39.400    childhood what I loved most I was lucky        361    00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.490    to have wonderful supportive parents who        362    00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:44.980    encouraged me and my parents are here        363    00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.310    today        364    00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:59.630    writing is what I love had I not had the        365    00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.360    good fortune of being published I would        366    00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.640    be somewhere right now completely        367    00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:08.149    unknown possibly broke but I would be        368    00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:11.870    writing some of you here today like me        369    00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.950    know what you love and some of you don't        370    00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:19.610    if you don't know you will if not        371    00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.610    something that you love then something        372    00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.799    that you like or something that you        373    00:21:24.799 --> 00:21:31.960    don't hate or something you will find it        374    00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:36.169    but to find it you must try the        375    00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:39.409    wonderful Shonda Rhimes said very wisely        376    00:21:39.409 --> 00:21:42.950    that you have to do something until you        377    00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:47.330    can do something else try if it doesn't        378    00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:49.250    work out try something else        379    00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:52.610    I knew from spending a year in medical        380    00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:55.610    school that it was not for me actually        381    00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:57.890    that's not really true I knew even        382    00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:00.470    before medical school but going to        383    00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:03.549    medical school clarified it for me and        384    00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:07.159    it's not wasted time it's experience and        385    00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:09.950    experience will serve you in ways you do        386    00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:14.600    not expect I cannot tell you how many        387    00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.600    times in the course of writing my second        388    00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.390    novel half of a Yellow Sun which was a        389    00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:22.990    deeply        390    00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:30.419    which was a deeply emotional book for me        391    00:22:30.419 --> 00:22:35.250    I felt choked with uncertainty I would        392    00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:40.320    climb into bed and eat chocolate but I        393    00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.690    knew that after all the chocolate eating        394    00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:46.429    after all the sinking into a dark place        395    00:22:46.429 --> 00:22:50.450    that I would get up and keep writing I        396    00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:53.009    cannot tell you how often I would sit        397    00:22:53.009 --> 00:22:55.860    down to write and instead I would find        398    00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:59.600    myself going online to look at shoes and        399    00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.879    to put different shoes in various online        400    00:23:02.879 --> 00:23:05.879    carts and then remove some and put some        401    00:23:05.879 --> 00:23:07.889    back on order some and then not all out        402    00:23:07.889 --> 00:23:11.909    some I'm actually thinking of starting a        403    00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:15.769    society of esteemed procrastinators and        404    00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:18.029    I suspect that many of you would        405    00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:21.960    probably sign up procrastinating is a        406    00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.200    form of fear and it is difficult at        407    00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.070    knowledge fear but the truth is that you        408    00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.889    cannot create anything of value without        409    00:23:31.889 --> 00:23:36.059    both self-doubt and self belief without        410    00:23:36.059 --> 00:23:39.899    self-doubt you become complacent without        411    00:23:39.899 --> 00:23:43.169    self belief you cannot succeed you need        412    00:23:43.169 --> 00:23:47.429    both and there is also the fear of        413    00:23:47.429 --> 00:23:51.509    measuring up of keeping up which for you        414    00:23:51.509 --> 00:23:55.080    might be heightened by the heavy weight        415    00:23:55.080 --> 00:24:00.360    of all those Harvard expectations I want        416    00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.090    to share a line from a lovely poem by        417    00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:07.769    Mary Oliver whoever you are no matter        418    00:24:07.769 --> 00:24:12.450    how lonely the world offers itself to        419    00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:17.490    your imagination when you fall into the        420    00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:20.250    funk of competition when you compare        421    00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.289    yourself with other Harvard graduates        422    00:24:22.289 --> 00:24:24.509    when you worry that you didn't get that        423    00:24:24.509 --> 00:24:27.840    job at Goldman or McKinsey or in Silicon        424    00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.629    Valley right after graduation or didn't        425    00:24:30.629 --> 00:24:33.480    win a Pulitzer at 30 or didn't become a        426    00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.549    managing director partner of something        427    00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:39.179    at 35 think of literature        428    00:24:39.179 --> 00:24:41.759    think of the early bloomers and the late        429    00:24:41.759 --> 00:24:45.059    bloomers think of the many experimental        430    00:24:45.059 --> 00:24:47.249    novels that do not follow the        431    00:24:47.249 --> 00:24:51.119    traditional form your story does not        432    00:24:51.119 --> 00:24:55.559    have to have a traditional arc there is        433    00:24:55.559 --> 00:24:59.779    an ebow scene Vanya G Cooney bhutesu Xia        434    00:24:59.779 --> 00:25:04.499    it translates literally to whenever you        435    00:25:04.499 --> 00:25:09.869    wake up that is your morning what        436    00:25:09.869 --> 00:25:13.769    matters is that you wake up the world is        437    00:25:13.769 --> 00:25:14.869    calling you        438    00:25:14.869 --> 00:25:18.419    America is calling you there is work to        439    00:25:18.419 --> 00:25:22.469    be done there are tarnished things that        440    00:25:22.469 --> 00:25:26.070    need to shine again there are broken        441    00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:30.379    things that need to be made whole again        442    00:25:30.379 --> 00:25:35.129    you are in a position to do this you can        443    00:25:35.129 --> 00:25:35.879    do it        444    00:25:35.879 --> 00:25:40.499    be courageous tell the truth I wish you        445    00:25:40.499 --> 00:25:43.590    courage and I wish you well        446    00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:49.830    [Applause]

   00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.970    Okay so I know most of you guys are    probably nursing a hangover from last        2    00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.970    night but I really need you to pay    attention for the next 10 minutes it's        3    00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:19.289    pretty important okay there is a    question that every single person        4    00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.199    graduating tomorrow knows the answer to    some of us more certain of this question        5    00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.289    than others and many of us actually come    to Harvard to figure this out but even        6    00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.910    if we don't know the answer it's a    question that we ask ourselves often and        7    00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.390    it's something we spend four years    trying to figure out what am I gonna do        8    00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.219    with my talents some of us are gonna    change lives and classrooms around the        9    00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.860    world reimagining how education is    practiced and theorized some will use        10    00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.449    their talents to take your patience and    cure disease many are going to become        11    00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.650    lawyers and legislators still others    writers actors comics and heads of state        12    00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:10.860    and I'd be lying if I didn't think about    this question myself but I felt more        13    00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.409    lost about this question this is because    I like so many other students at this        14    00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.500    university was lost about my place at    Harvard whether I belonged and what I        15    00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.330    could possibly hope to contribute to    such a vast and hallowed institution I        16    00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.900    am one of the nation's eleven point    three million undocumented immigrants my        17    00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.490    father finds work as a line cook in    restaurants across New York City and my        18    00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.380    mother finds work in beauty salons so if    you've ever eaten at a Korean restaurant        19    00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.890    or receive the mani-pedi in New York    City congratulations        20    00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.090    like it or not you may have partially    subsidized the education of what Fox        21    00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.250    News would call an illegal alien my    parents are actually here today        22    00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:18.470    mo- thank you, papa - don't cry I knew        23    00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.810    early on that my talents were merely a    testament to their sacrifice a product        24    00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.730    of their original dream to secure a    better life for me and so I knew most of        25    00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.070    all that my talents were not my own    they were molded by my parents labor        26    00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.830    shaped by their bowed legs and their    blistered hands my talents are        27    00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.260    indistinguishable from their labor they    are one in the same        28    00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.470    thus this perspective I brought with me    to Harvard gave new meaning to the        29    00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.440    question of what am I going to do with    my talents        30    00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.450    I felt bound to my community I felt    beholding to my undocumented people        31    00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.390    particularly those in my home in Queens    my immigration status is always affected        32    00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.200    the way that I see the world affected    the way that I envision my place in        33    00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.470    society and by extension what I wanted    to do with my so-called talents and so I        34    00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.920    wondered what am I gonna do with my    talents in the face of this impossible        35    00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.580    question I searched for my answer at the    center of all human knowledge Widener        36    00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.709    Library to be specific under Widener    there's a small yet indispensable part        37    00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.070    of Harvard called the Pussey archives    which is home to many of the private        38    00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.600    documents of distinguished Harvard    faculty I found the answer to this        39    00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.030    question buried in the personal library    of John Rawls a famous political        40    00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.010    philosopher at Harvard who according to    President Clinton helped the whole        41    00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.860    generation of Americans revive their    faith and democracy itself and this is        42    00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.690    definitely true for me at a time when    the President of the United States        43    00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.180    believes that I don't belong here John    Rawls helped me envision in America        44    00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:13.519    shaped by principles of justice fair    inclusion and human equality so Rawls        45    00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.230    tells us that there's a sense in which    this question we all ask ourselves what        46    00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.660    am I going to    do with my talents has hidden within it        47    00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.870    a false assumption this assumption is    the commonly held belief that our        48    00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.590    talents are gifts of intelligence health    wealth charm wit and abilities is        49    00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.470    something we can claim as our own Rawls    challenges us to question whether our        50    00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.599    talents are something we can truly claim    ownership over like D Hall plates or        51    00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:49.979    that last piece of chicken breasts blow    the grill closes indeed Rawls says that        52    00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.470    one's talents are merely the product of    luck an arbitrary force dispensed to        53    00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.080    humans based on no moral standard    thus he argued we must think about our        54    00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.050    talents as a collective asset a common    asset that must be leveraged as part of        55    00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.270    a well-regulated political union ok so    now to be sure some of you were thinking        56    00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.389    but these are my talents I was the one    who worked to cultivate them I was the        57    00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:23.190    one who spent all those hours at Lamont    and I was the one who shed sweat tears        58    00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.259    and peppermint Rubinoff to perfect my    abilities I deserve what flows from my        59    00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:33.810    talents why should I think about it as a    common asset like a public restroom or        60    00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.770    John Harvard's foot now hear me out hear    me out what I'm saying        61    00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.750    is that thinking about our talents as a    collective asset helps us escape the        62    00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.599    language that often surrounds the    conversations that we have with each        63    00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:52.199    other at Harvard we often swim in a    culture that says talented people get        64    00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:58.199    what they deserve right that those with    higher GPAs are smarter that those who        65    00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.550    get punched by final clubs are cooler    than those who do not that those who        66    00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.479    work at Goldman are more brilliant than    those who do not alright maybe that's my        67    00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.310    last what isn't true but we swim in this    culture that says what you get is tied        68    00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:20.219    to your talents in reality our talents    are products of social collaboration our        69    00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:26.550    intelligence charm and abilities only    blossom when others believe and invest        70    00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.830    in us I think this is clearest at    Harvard        71    00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:36.050    the only thing I would venture to say is    true for every single person in our        72    00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:42.560    class is that not one of us could have    gotten to this point on our own dining        73    00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.490    hall workers nourish our bodies    librarians and archivists preserve the        74    00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.810    knowledge and heritage we rely on to    write our papers and landscapers and        75    00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.530    custodial staff make our campus a    beautiful place for us to completely        76    00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:00.110    ignore as we swipe away on tinder our TFs and professors sit down with us time        77    00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.120    and time again to explain for the    hundredth time things like how a        78    00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.039    protease inhibitor works or why the hell    Nietzsche was so angry indeed our        79    00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:14.990    talents are developed through    interaction with others in a web what        80    00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.789    Rawls called a close knitted an    interconnected political community        81    00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:26.419    composed both of people you know but    more by people you do not and once we        82    00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:31.360    accept this there's no reason why the    duties we have to those we know        83    00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:37.460    shouldn't also extend to those we do not    indeed there's no reason why the close        84    00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:43.880    bonds of fellowship we often feel to our    family and friends shouldn't also extend        85    00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:50.870    to those we don't know in our political    union and that's why Rawls is vision of        86    00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:57.680    society as a political community is more    than a catchphrase when we share a        87    00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:04.340    society your life affects mine whether    we know each other or not and we have to        88    00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:10.509    evaluate this joint project by the hole    because if you think about it our        89    00:08:10.509 --> 00:08:16.310    particular positions within the web of    society come to us most of all through        90    00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:24.289    fortune not desert therefore how we    treat everyone in our union not just        91    00:08:24.289 --> 00:08:30.080    those who are talented is really a    reflection of our personal values who we        92    00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:37.519    want to care about who we want to    include and who we want to protect at        93    00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:41.539    Harvard we can often be blind to the    fact that we have duties to one another        94    00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:43.900    that demand    more from us than simple        95    00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:50.210    non-interference, non-interference that    says i'll do with my talents what I will        96    00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:56.600    and you do with your talents what you    will non-interference that says we        97    00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.680    should draw the line of membership in    our society only around those who        98    00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:08.230    possess talents on the contrary we have    a positive responsibility to others a        99    00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:15.230    duty to liberate those who are unable to    wonder what am I going to do with my        100    00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:20.690    talents and I know this isn't easy it's    not easy because it demands that we        101    00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:26.840    reject this notion that we can truly own    our talents it demands that we step up        102    00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:34.610    and own our good fortune enough to give    its fruits away but if it's any        103    00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.930    consolation there's a reason that the    inscription facing you as you leave the        104    00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:47.180    yard says depart to serve better thy    country and mankind not depart to serve        105    00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:55.880    better thyself and I can thus I believe    truly taking this adage seriously and        106    00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:01.490    taking it to heart requires us to ask    ourselves a slightly different form of        107    00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.950    the question we all know the answer to        108    00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:15.730    what am I going to do for others with my    talents thank you        109    00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.730    you        "

   00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.429    I'm sure many of you have had this    experience it's late at night and you        2    00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.690    start browsing Netflix looking for    something to watch you scroll through        3    00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.240    different titles you even read a few    reviews but you just can't commit to        4    00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.400    watching any given movie suddenly it's    been 30 minutes and you're still stuck        5    00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.429    in infinite browsing mode so you just    give up you're too tired to watch        6    00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.960    anything now so you cut your losses and    fall asleep I've come to believe that        7    00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.850    this is the defining characteristic of    our generation let's call it keeping our        8    00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.559    options open there's this philosopher    Zygmunt Bauman he calls it liquid        9    00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.829    modernity we never want to commit to any    one identity or place or community so we        10    00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.060    remain like liquid in a state that can    adapt to fit any future shape liquid        11    00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.720    modernity is infinite browsing mode but    for everything in our lives I've been        12    00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.369    thinking about this recently because    leaving home and coming here is a lot        13    00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.130    like entering a long hallway you walk    out of the room in which you grew up and        14    00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.470    into this place with thousands of    different doors to infinitely browse and        15    00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.250    throughout my time here I've I've seen    all the good that can come from having        16    00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.740    so many new options I've seen the joy a    person feels when they find a room more        17    00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.509    fitting for their authentic self I've    seen big decisions become less painful        18    00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.070    because you can always quit you can    always move you can always break up in        19    00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.590    the hallway will always be there and    mostly I've seen all the fun folks have        20    00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.119    had experiencing more novelty than any    generation in history ever experienced        21    00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:07.170    but as I've grown older here I've also    started seeing the downsides of having        22    00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.900    so many open doors nobody wants to be    stuck behind a locked door but nobody        23    00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.470    wants to live    in a hallway either it's great to have        24    00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.850    options when you lose interest in    something but I've learned here that the        25    00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.730    more times I do this the less satisfied    I am with any given option and lately        26    00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.960    the experiences I crave are less the    rushes of novelty and more those perfect        27    00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.850    Tuesday nights when you eat dinner with    the friends who you have known for a        28    00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.730    long time who you've made a commitment    to and who won't quit you because they        29    00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:52.200    found someone better I've discovered in    my time here that the people who inspire        30    00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.880    me the most are those who have left the    hallway shut the door behind them and        31    00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.440    settled in I think of Fred Rogers    recording episode 895 of Mister Rogers        32    00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.420    neighborhood because he was committed to    advancing a humane model of moral        33    00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.390    education I think of Dorothy Day sitting    with the same outcast folks night after        34    00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.770    night after night because it was    important that someone is committed to        35    00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.080    them I think of Martin Luther King but    not just the Martin Luther King who        36    00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.530    confronted the fire hoses in 1963 but    the Martin Luther King who hosted his        37    00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:40.170    thousandth tedious planning meeting in    1967 when Hollywood tells tales of        38    00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.420    courage they usually take the form of    slaying the dragon it's all about the        39    00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.320    big brave moments but I've been learning    from these heroes that the most menacing        40    00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.630    dragons that stand in the way of    reforming the system or repairing the        41    00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.840    breach or the everyday boredom and    distraction and uncertainty that can        42    00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.110    erode our ability to commit to anything    for the long haul it's why I love that        43    00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:17.820    the word dedicate has two meanings first    it means to make something holy second        44    00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.590    it means to stick at something for a    long time I don't think this is a        45    00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.930    coincidence we do something holy when we    choose to commit        46    00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.750    to something and in the most dedicated    people I have met I have witnessed how        47    00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:42.199    that pursuit of holiness comes with a    side effect of immense joy we may have        48    00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:47.960    come here to help keep our options open    but I leave believing that the most        49    00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.500    radical act we can take is to make a    commitment to a particular thing to a        50    00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:04.910    place to a profession to a cause to a    community to a person to show our love        51    00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.810    for something by working at it for a    long time and to close doors and forgo        52    00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:21.320    options for its sake we often assume    that some acute and looming threat be it        53    00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.979    a foreign invader or a domestic    demagogue will be our downfall but if we        54    00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:33.740    were to end that end is just as likely    to come from something far less dramatic        55    00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:41.900    our failure to sustain the work it is    not only the bomb or the bully that        56    00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:48.710    should keep us up at night it is also    the garden untilled and the newcomer        57    00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:57.220    unwelcomed the neighbor unhoused and the    prisoner unheard the voice of the public        58    00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:05.110    unheeded and the long simmering calamity    unhaulted and the dream of equal justice        59    00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.110    unrealized        60    00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:22.010    but we need not be afraid for we have in    our possession        61    00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:31.370    the antidote to our dread our time free    to be dedicated to the slow but        62    00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:38.830    necessary work of turning visions into    projects values into practices and        63    00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:49.460    strangers into neighbors that is why in    this age of liquid modernity we should        64    00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:57.400    rebel and join up with a counterculture    of commitment consisting of solid people        65    00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:04.340    that is why in this age of infinite    browsing mode we should pick a damn        66    00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.590    movie and see it all the way through        67    00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:23.920    before we fall asleep let's get to work

   00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:09.780    in 1951 in a poem titled Harlem Langston    Hughes asked a question I continue to        2    00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:18.720    ask myself today what happens to a dream    deferred does it dry up like A Raisin in        3    00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.099    the Sun when my mother was a little girl    growing up in the Nigerian village of Ososo        4    00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.910    her and her four siblings would get    super excited whenever one of them would        5    00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.750    accomplish something noteworthy why well    it meant that her dad would do the tree        6    00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.680    thing that's when the smile was    stretched across his face as he climbed        7    00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.360    a tall tree branch by branch all the way    to the very top his children down below        8    00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.750    would look up at him eyes wide    sparkling and full of joy as he yelled        9    00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:04.920    out higher higher and higher though    proud he was also never satisfied he had        10    00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.280    a dream that his children and his    children's children would strive for        11    00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.939    even greater things a big part of that    dream was a pursuit of an education you        12    00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.680    see while in some families bedtime    stories are of dragons princesses and        13    00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.810    castles in Nigerian families our stories    consists of law school med school and        14    00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:38.640    Harvard and I'm only kinda joking after    all educational opportunity is what        15    00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.299    drove my parents to trek across the    Atlantic from Nigeria to Toronto Canada        16    00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.429    before I was born    and so throughout my high school        17    00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.049    education I like many of you strove for    excellence with hours of study meetings        18    00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.390    and practice all to fulfill the goal of    one day attending Harvard and on        19    00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.859    December 13th 2013 that dream came true    I along with 2,000 other high school        20    00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:08.369    seniors was fortunate enough to receive    an acceptance letter from Harvard        21    00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.950    University and my first thought after    reading that letter was that my        22    00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.739    grandfather in that tree and I knew it    was time to aim higher but I wasn't        23    00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.290    quite sure yet we're doing eight months    later I was preparing for my freshman        24    00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.310    year at Harvard little did I know events    happening over 700 miles southwest of my        25    00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.239    home in Toronto Canada which transformed    my dream and my life forever        26    00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.239    these events would shatter the sheltered    comfort of the life my parents had        27    00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:49.590    created for me because on August 9th    2014 just over a week before I would        28    00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.299    arrive at Harvard for the first time    Michael Brown was shot and killed by the        29    00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.190    police in his hometown of Ferguson    Missouri through his death        30    00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:06.329    I saw what happens to those whose dreams    are deferred and ultimately denied they        31    00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:13.950    are left to dry up abandoned like his    dead murdered body which lay on the        32    00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:22.500    streets of Ferguson under the hot    Missouri Sun for eight hours eight hours        33    00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.650    just like me    Michael was black just like me Michael        34    00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.760    was 18 just like me Michael was about to    go to college unlike me however he would        35    00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.669    never get the chance to see that dream    realized and it was at that moment it        36    00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:48.120    hit me after years of believing that my    grandfather's dream meant educational        37    00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.419    attainment the accumulation of the    accolades or even acceptance to Harvard        38    00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:59.370    Michael Brown's death woke me up    it made me realize the dream was about        39    00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.409    much more than how high we can climb in    that tree as individuals it was about        40    00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:09.599    how we can encourage and enable those    like Michael Brown whose dreams are        41    00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.329    deferred and denied the climb with us        42    00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.289    and        43    00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.740    and while education is the essential    part of achieving that dream we often        44    00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.590    forget it is an incomplete answer we    forget that textbooks don't do much to        45    00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.910    teach us about compassion and that    problem sets don't necessarily teach us        46    00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.949    about the unconditional and unfaltering    love of others we forget that whether        47    00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.120    you are a banker a teacher or an    activist the dream should be about        48    00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.440    creating the conditions for life liberty    and the pursuit of happiness for        49    00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.389    everyone who walks his planet and so    while we strive to achieve our dreams        50    00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.120    with the privileges that this Harvard    education affords us we can't forget        51    00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:07.300    just how many dreams have been deferred    denied and left to drive like A Raisin        52    00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.840    in the Sun you see I never met my    grandfather except through history of        53    00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.949    dreams but today I stand before you as a    proud grandson of a Nigerian carpenter        54    00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.940    the child of 2fNigerian immigrants and a    graduate of one of the greatest        55    00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.470    institutions in the world        56    00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:39.460    proof proof that while we all have    dreams some of us have to travel farther        57    00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:46.260    to achieve them both figuratively and    literally my wish is that with our help        58    00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:52.120    more dreams can be converted into    realities that is a calling that the        59    00:05:52.120 --> 00:06:00.090    class of 2018 must answer a dual mandate    to do well and to do good to wake up        60    00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:06.210    look around and help those whose crime    is stifled by the burdens of oppression        61    00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:12.810    your future in my future in the future    of our society depends on us creating        62    00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.710    supporting and investing in the dreams    that the next generation can live up to        63    00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.680    and build upon it depends on us looking    one another in the eye and telling one        64    00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.680    another to continue to strive for more    to keep growing and to never ever stop        65    00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:37.500    climbing because the next generation is    watching looking up at us eyes wide        66    00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:48.210    sparkling and full of joy as we yell out    higher higher and higher        "

   00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.390    Thank you, Susan, for those generous words,    and thank you graduates, alumni and friends        2    00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.900    for that generous welcome.        3    00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.240    Heartfelt congratulations to you, our graduates,    and to your families for the hard work and        4    00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.030    many accomplishments that have brought you    to this day.        5    00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.220    I am especially grateful to John Lewis for    sharing his inspiring words and presence with        6    00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.610    us.        7    00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:37.819    There can be no finer example of how to live    a life than that of John Lewis, whose courage,        8    00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:46.800    dedication, selflessness, and moral clarity    have for more than a half century challenged        9    00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.230    this country to realize its promise of liberty    and justice for all.        10    00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:01.920    It is an inexpressible honor and privilege    to stand on this stage beside him.        11    00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.200    Almost eleven years ago I stood on this platform    to deliver my inaugural address as Harvard’s        12    00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.170    28th president.        13    00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.890    Today’s remarks represent something of a    bookend—a kind of valedictory—vale-dictory,        14    00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.540    literally, farewell words.        15    00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:32.030    When I spoke in 2007, I observed that inaugural    speeches are “by definition pronouncements        16    00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.460    by individuals who don’t yet know what they    are talking about.”        17    00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.700    By now I can no longer invoke that excuse.        18    00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.810    I am close to knowing all I ever will about    being Harvard’s president.        19    00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:58.980    I then went on to say something else about    the peculiar genre of inaugural addresses:        20    00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:06.870    that we might dub them, as I put it then,    “expressions of hope unchastened by the        21    00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.390    rod of experience.”        22    00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.250    By now I should know that rod.        23    00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:22.620    In my mind I hear the Jimi Hendrix of my youth    asking: “Are you experienced?”        24    00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.010    I would have to answer affirmatively.        25    00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.810    Perhaps not as experienced as Charles William    Eliot who made it through 40 years as Harvard        26    00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.310    president.        27    00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.190    But 11 years is a long time.        28    00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:48.940    Think about it: the iPhone and I were launched    within 48 hours of each other in the summer        29    00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.480    of 2007.        30    00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:58.211    We are now so attached to our devices that    it seems almost unimaginable that they were        31    00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:00.660    not always there.        32    00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.650    The smartphone initiated a revolution in how    we communicate, how we interact, how we organize        33    00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.740    our lives.        34    00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.930    We are only beginning to understand the impact    of this digital transformation on our disrupted        35    00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.420    society, economy, politics—and even our    brains.        36    00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.660    2008 brought the financial crisis and the    loss of close to a third of our endowment—prompting        37    00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.640    us in the ensuing years to overturn a system    of governance that had been in place since        38    00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.950    1650, and to transform our financial—and    ultimately our investment—processes and        39    00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.599    policies.        40    00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:50.209    Five years ago, we lived through the marathon    bombings and the arrival of terror in our        41    00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.280    very midst—and came together as Boston Strong.        42    00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.760    We have experienced wild weather from hurricanes    to snowmageddon to bombogenesis, and doubled        43    00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.620    down on our commitment to combat climate change.        44    00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.629    We have confronted a cheating crisis, an email    crisis, a primate crisis, and sexual assault        45    00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:25.460    and sexual harassment crises—and made significant    and lasting changes in response to each.        46    00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:34.560    We have faced down H1N1, Ebola, Zika, and    even the mumps.        47    00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:42.660    We have been challenged—as well as often    inspired and enlightened—by renewed and        48    00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:53.600    passionate student activism: Occupy; Black    Lives Matter; Divest Harvard; I, Too, Am Harvard;        49    00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.650    Undocumented at Harvard and hashtag Me Too.        50    00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:06.620    We have faced a political and policy environment    increasingly hostile to expertise and skeptical        51    00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:14.380    about higher education: the unprecedented    endowment tax passed last December will, we        52    00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:23.020    estimate, impose on us a levy next year equivalent    to $2,000 per student.        53    00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.479    There has indeed been a good measure of chastening.        54    00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:36.080    But today I want to focus not on that “rod    of experience,” but on what I then defined        55    00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:43.199    as the essence of an inaugural message: the    expression of hope.        56    00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:53.240    Now, as then, that is what fills both my mind    and my heart as I think about Harvard, its        57    00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.520    present and its future.        58    00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:05.270    These past eleven years have only strengthened    my faith in higher education and its possibilities.        59    00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:14.759    Hope, I have learned, derives not just from    the innocence of inexperience, but from the        60    00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:24.570    everyday realities, the day-to-day work of    leading and loving this university.        61    00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:34.270    At a time of growing distrust of institutions    and constant attacks on colleges and universities,        62    00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:43.370    I want to affirm my belief that they are beacons    of hope—I think our best hope—for the        63    00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.930    future to which we aspire.        64    00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:54.259    In their very essence universities are about    hope and about the future, and that is at        65    00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:59.169    the heart of what we celebrate today.        66    00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:03.240    Hope is the foundation of learning.        67    00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:13.199    The 6,989 graduates we honor today arrived    here with aspirations about what education        68    00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:20.291    could make possible, with dreams about how    their lives would be changed because of the        69    00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:23.120    time they would spend here.        70    00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:33.210    Dean Rakesh Khurana regularly speaks to students    in the College about the transformations—intellectual,        71    00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:40.229    social, personal—they should seek from their    undergraduate experience, urging them to articulate        72    00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:45.569    their hopes and define a path toward realizing    them.        73    00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:52.889    And we do have such very high aspirations    for them: that they find lives of meaning        74    00:07:52.889 --> 00:08:00.800    and purpose, that they discover a passion    that animates them, that they strive toward        75    00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:08.630    veritas, that they use their education to    do good in the world.        76    00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:16.650    Never has the world needed these graduates    more, and I think they understand that.        77    00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:23.380    I had lunch with a dozen or so seniors a month    ago, and I asked them to characterize their        78    00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.820    four years here.        79    00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:32.270    They spoke of the ways they had changed and    grown, but, more pointedly, they spoke of        80    00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:37.539    how the world seemed to have changed around    them.        81    00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:44.120    They worried about the health and sustainability    of the earth; they worried about the health        82    00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.310    of our democracy and of civil society.        83    00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:56.410    And they described how their attitudes and    plans had altered because of these changed        84    00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.440    circumstances.        85    00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:05.151    They no longer took their world for granted;    the future of our society, our country, our        86    00:09:05.151 --> 00:09:11.870    planet could not be guaranteed; it was up    to them.        87    00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:20.140    Their careers and life goals had shifted to    embrace a much broader sense of responsibility        88    00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:27.360    extending beyond themselves to encompass an    obligation to a common good they had come        89    00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.510    to recognize might not survive without them.        90    00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:40.520    I thought of these students as something akin    to alchemists—confronting dark realities        91    00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:49.570    and forging a golden path that offered hope—to    themselves about their own lives, but to all        92    00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:59.000    of us as we imagine what these extraordinary    graduates will do with and for the damaged        93    00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.100    world we offer them as their inheritance.        94    00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:09.250    It would be impossible to be surrounded by    these students as they move through their        95    00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:17.680    time at Harvard without being filled with    hope about the future they will create.        96    00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:26.700    To paraphrase the Ed School’s Campaign slogan,    they are here learning to change the world.        97    00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:33.630    Building a more enlightened world is of course    the fundamental work of the faculty as well,        98    00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:39.130    and at the core of Harvard’s identity as    a research university.        99    00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:46.180    The fundamental question we ask as we consider    appointing a professor is “What has this        100    00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:53.940    person done to alter and enhance our understanding    of the world?”        101    00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:59.649    Perhaps they have revealed how the microbiome    works, or how international trade agreements        102    00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:09.110    affect economic prosperity, or how undocumented    students confront educational challenges.        103    00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:16.290    Perhaps they’ve unlocked ways to identify    the actual location of genes that cause schizophrenia,        104    00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:24.100    or have discovered how to engineer an exo-suit    to enable a person to walk.        105    00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:31.240    Harvard scholars explore history and literature    to help us understand tyranny; art to illuminate        106    00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:38.610    the foundations of justice; law and technology    to address assaults on fundamental assumptions        107    00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.440    about privacy.        108    00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:49.970    With its eye cast on creating a different    future, all of this work is founded in hope—of        109    00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:57.000    seeing something more clearly, of influencing    others to change their understanding and perhaps        110    00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.860    even their actions.        111    00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:07.529    We are by definition a community of idealists,    thinking beyond the present and the status        112    00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:16.460    quo to imagine how and when things could be    different, could be otherwise.        113    00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:23.209    The privilege of interacting with Harvard’s    remarkable students and faculty, and the dedicated        114    00:12:23.209 --> 00:12:30.730    staff who support their work has uplifted    me every day for the past eleven years.        115    00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:36.779    It would be next to impossible not to believe    in the future they are so intent to build.        116    00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:44.660    But there is another way that Harvard fills    me with hope, and that is the way we as a        117    00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:51.050    community—living and working together within    these walls—are endeavoring ourselves to        118    00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:57.610    grapple with the challenging forces dividing    and threatening the world—forces like climate        119    00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:05.149    change, or the divisiveness that poisons our    society and polity, the undermining of facts        120    00:13:05.149 --> 00:13:10.730    and rational discourse, the chilling of free    speech.        121    00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:17.200    We might in some ways see the work we have    undertaken together on sustainability as emblematic        122    00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.810    of these wider efforts.        123    00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:23.860    We have come to consider ourselves a living    laboratory.        124    00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:29.100    Our research and engagement on environmental    issues of course stretches well beyond our        125    00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:35.680    walls: our faculty, for example, have played    critical roles in forging international climate        126    00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:42.950    agreements, have engineered innovative ways    to create and store renewable energy, have        127    00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:49.649    influenced regulatory frameworks from Washington    to Beijing, have explored the searing impact        128    00:13:49.649 --> 00:13:52.860    of climate change on health.        129    00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:59.660    But at the same time we have endeavored to    make our own community a model for what might        130    00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:06.640    be possible—what we might hope for as we    imagine the future.        131    00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:15.110    We have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions    by 30%, our trash by 44%; we produce 1.5 megawatts        132    00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:19.649    of solar energy—enough to fuel 300 homes.        133    00:14:19.649 --> 00:14:24.860    We have programs experimenting with healthy    building materials, green cleaning, and food        134    00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:32.130    waste, and we have constructed HouseZero,    an energy neutral structure that is essentially        135    00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:39.500    an enormous computer generating data about    every aspect of its operation and design,        136    00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:45.100    making information available to others as    they build for the future.        137    00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:50.779    We seek to be a living experiment in other    ways as well.        138    00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:58.490    We gather here in Cambridge, face to face    in a residential educational setting because        139    00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:04.860    we regard this very community as an educational    machine.        140    00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:10.490    I have often observed that Harvard is likely    the most diverse environment in which most        141    00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:13.830    of our students have ever lived.        142    00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:20.080    We endeavor to attract talented individuals    from the widest possible range of backgrounds,        143    00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:28.630    experiences and interests, the broadest diversity    of geographic origins, socio-economic circumstances,        144    00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:36.730    ethnicities, races, religions, gender identities,    sexual orientations, political perspectives.        145    00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:44.380    And we ask students to learn from these differences,    to teach one another—and to teach us as        146    00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:49.640    well—with the variety of who they are and    what they bring.        147    00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.550    This isn’t easy.        148    00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:58.600    It requires individuals to question long-held    assumptions, to open their minds and their        149    00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:06.010    hearts to ideas and arguments that may seem    not just unfamiliar, but even disturbing and        150    00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.240    disorienting.        151    00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:14.240    And it is an experiment that becomes ever    more difficult in an increasingly polarized        152    00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:22.209    social and political environment in which    expressions of hatred, bigotry, and divisiveness        153    00:16:22.209 --> 00:16:26.920    seem not just permitted but encouraged.        154    00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:34.829    But in spite of these challenges all around    us, we at Harvard strive to be enriched, not        155    00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:39.100    divided by our differences.        156    00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:46.269    To sustain this vision of an educational community,    we must be a living laboratory in another        157    00:16:46.269 --> 00:16:49.020    sense as well.        158    00:16:49.020 --> 00:17:07.709    We must be a place where facts matter, where    reasoned         159    00:17:07.709 --> 00:17:13.979    and respectful discourse and debate serve    as arbiters of truth.        160    00:17:13.979 --> 00:17:20.100    There has been much recent criticism of universities    for not being sufficiently open to differing        161    00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.829    viewpoints.        162    00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:27.899    Protecting and nourishing free speech is for    us a fundamental commitment, and one that        163    00:17:27.899 --> 00:17:34.830    demands constant attention and vigilance,    especially in a time of sharp political and        164    00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.770    social polarization.        165    00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:49.100    The uncontrolled—and uncontrollable—cacophony    that defines a university means we will inevitably        166    00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:55.950    sometimes fall short; we cannot always guarantee    that every member of this community listens        167    00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:59.360    generously to every other.        168    00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.200    But that must simply motivate us to redouble    our efforts.        169    00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:10.769    Silencing ideas or basking in comfortable    intellectual orthodoxy independent of facts        170    00:18:10.769 --> 00:18:24.090    and evidence blocks our access to new and    better ideas.        171    00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:30.509    We must be dedicated to the belief that truth    cannot simply be asserted or claimed but must        172    00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:39.149    be established with evidence and tested with    argument.        173    00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:46.919    Truth serves as inspiration and aspiration    in all we do; it pulls us toward the future        174    00:18:46.919 --> 00:18:53.479    and its possibilities for seeing more clearly,    understanding more fully, and improving ourselves        175    00:18:53.479 --> 00:18:55.370    and the world.        176    00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:59.799    Its pursuit is fueled by hope.        177    00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:06.110    Hope joins with truth as the as the very essence    of a university.        178    00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:15.590    And so I come back to hope—the hope implicit    in our efforts to model a different way for        179    00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:23.289    humans to live and work together, the hope    in the ideas and discoveries that are the        180    00:19:23.289 --> 00:19:32.970    currency we trade in, the hope in the bright    futures of those who graduate today.        181    00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:39.450    Yet as I step down from my responsibilities    as Harvard president, I am keenly aware of        182    00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:44.299    another of hope’s fundamental attributes.        183    00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:53.789    It implies work still unfinished, aspirations    not yet matched by achievement, possibilities        184    00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:57.389    yet to be seized and realized.        185    00:19:57.389 --> 00:20:00.789    Hope is a challenge.        186    00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:07.350    I think of the words the beloved late crew    coach Harry Parker once spoke to a rower—words        187    00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:16.109    I quoted often during the campaign: “This    is what you can be.        188    00:20:16.109 --> 00:20:20.109    Do you want to be that?”        189    00:20:20.109 --> 00:20:26.330    These are the words and the message I would    like to leave with Harvard.        190    00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:27.879    The work is unfinished.        191    00:20:27.879 --> 00:20:37.779    The job remains still to be done in times    that make it perhaps more difficult than ever.        192    00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:46.270    May we continue to challenge ourselves with    the hope of all we can be and with the unwavering        193    00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:50.529    determination to be that.        194    00:20:50.529 --> 00:20:59.849    May Harvard be as wise as it is smart    As restless as it is proud        195    00:20:59.849 --> 00:21:07.139    As bold as it is thoughtful    As new as it is old        196    00:21:07.139 --> 00:21:21.189    As good as it is great.

   00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:11.190    Congratulations Class of 2018 we should    be so proud of ourselves for all our        2    00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.080    accomplishments and hard work and bla    bla bla bla bla bla bla        3    00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.020    this week we have been hearing that    non-stop friends and family take        4    00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.779    pictures of us as if we were the John    Harvard statue itself hug us to make up        5    00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.850    for our lack of physical contact over    the past four years and continually        6    00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.640    commend us on the most wonderful    achievement of our lives thus far        7    00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.800    Harvard but let's be honest with    ourselves it's been far from a smooth        8    00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.140    journey let's not forget that you    contracted mono within the first week of        9    00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.910    arriving to campus you sold your soul to    David Malin for an I took CS50 t-shirt        10    00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.620    you never dated anyone seriously or at    all and your grandma is panicking how        11    00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.280    could you do this to her you    concentrated in English or in economics        12    00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.310    but you still can't explain inflation    you got a 32% on your or go mid term and        13    00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.259    worse a b-plus in the Hebrew Bible you    slacker you drank more wine than water        14    00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.820    and wished more than once that someone    had stopped you from finishing those        15    00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.880    scallion pancakes at the Kong over four    years you made a total of three phone        16    00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.110    calls home and you stopped practicing    the piano you were so good and now        17    00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.170    you're still in the job search process    these things take time mom and dad so to        18    00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.909    all that I say congratulations        19    00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.229    we did make it through a significant    amount though we trekked through a        20    00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.179    hundred and ten inches of snow freshman    year broke thousands of plastic forks        21    00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.129    eating red spice chicken during the HUD    strike and came to realize those wisdom        22    00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:16.640    tooth surgeries were actually the mumps    we learned a whole new language in which        23    00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.769    blocking meant make making your first    harvard enemies long distance meant an        24    00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.819    eight minute shuttle ride and advising    meant receiving an email once a semester        25    00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.019    we learned to question our surroundings    I've heard some interesting ones over        26    00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:44.930    the past few years such as is anyone in    the Lampoon funny how does Crimson key        27    00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.540    measure facial symmetry does Harvard    model Congress actually attend any        28    00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.780    conferences during their fully funded    vacations why would women want to join        29    00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.010    the Hasty Pudding or anyone for that    matter        30    00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.459    why do Harvard acapella groups purposely    arrange their music to sound off-key and        31    00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.329    what does she mean when she says she    took on her position as punch master of        32    00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:17.310    the bee to truly make a difference    these are all valid questions and for        33    00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.969    answers please email Dean Khurana at FAS.    harvard.edu with USGSO sanctions in        34    00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:29.909    the subject line for a guaranteed quick    response but how much of this really        35    00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:35.609    matters from the moments we walked for    the yard as wide-eyed freshmen as former        36    00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.450    valedictorians debate champions and    team captains        37    00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.099    we have questioned our choices and    performances we enrolled in a course        38    00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.709    without realizing called rejection 10a    which although tough was still more        39    00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:56.609    tolerable than expose 20 in my first two    years of college I went through eight        40    00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.349    comp processes and got into only two of    those organizations I was rejected from        41    00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.329    classes anyone wanting to write a    25-page paper on carbon taxes should be        42    00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:13.139    allowed to do so and worse I was quaded    and with each apparent failure or        43    00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:21.389    letdown I questioned myself was I not    smart enough not talented enough not        44    00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:27.690    Upper East Side enough but the number of    times we applied to expose 40 or the        45    00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.070    number of times we comp the advocate and    still didn't get in or the number of        46    00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.389    times we sat on a bench during a    basketball game is not what defines us        47    00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:42.180    what matters is what we did next    we found the strength to try again to        48    00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.979    discover another creative outlook and to    wake up the next morning and train even        49    00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:53.909    harder what matters is that we learn    from our mistakes to never again speak        50    00:04:53.909 --> 00:05:00.830    to a crimson reporter and to only go to    UHS if you wanted an IV after yardfest        51    00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:08.639    so tomorrow when we exit these gates we    will take with us not only our GPAs or        52    00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:14.820    hoops prizes or capacity to write a    20-page paper in one night but also our        53    00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:21.389    grit and determination our ability to    face the inevitable challenges ahead we        54    00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:27.150    will of course also take with us our    understanding of very useful theoretical        55    00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.080    models and hype    medical thought experiments a perception        56    00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.590    that 7 minutes late is still on time and    a dependence on Lesley Kerwin to tell us        57    00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:44.700    when to wear our snow boots we have much    to be grateful for Thank You Harvard for        58    00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.590    giving us friends to wake us up for our    9 a.m. finals for giving us grad        59    00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.260    students to lead us through four hours    of silence in section and for somehow        60    00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:02.940    making our SLS's count as SPU's so    family and friends to couch our cameras        61    00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:09.800    open your arms for that hug and join me    in celebrating the class of 2018        62    00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.660    let's celebrate all the battles we have    lost and all the messes we have made        63    00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:25.260    class of 2018 keep venturing keep    falling down and keep getting right back        64

Pennsylvania.        35    00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.820    His parents were both    children of immigrants        36    00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.933    to this country from Eastern Europe.        37    00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.858    He attended Ohio State University,        38    00:02:14.858 --> 00:02:18.025    (audience applauding)        39    00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.550    where as a freshman he wrote a letter        40    00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.260    to then President Richard Nixon        41    00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.493    expressing his concerns about the country.        42    00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.200    And as remarkable as    it is for the freshman        43    00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.670    to write that letter, even    more remarkably President Nixon        44    00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.860    invited John Kasich to    come and meet with him        45    00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.070    and that meeting came close to the end        46    00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.570    of President Nixon's political career        47    00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.940    but marked just the beginning    of then undergraduate        48    00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.600    John Kasich's political career.        49    00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.480    Governor Kasich stayed in Ohio        50    00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.860    and ran for elected    office at the age of 26.        51    00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.570    He won and joined the Ohio State Senate.        52    00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.440    When he turned 30, he    ran for the United States        53    00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.400    House of Representatives    and won that race as well.        54    00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.600    For nearly 20 years after    that, from 1983 to 2001,        55    00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.300    he represented the 12th    Congressional District of Ohio.        56    00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.970    He eventually became Chairman    of the House Budget Committee        57    00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.420    and was one of the    architects of the agreement        58    00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.190    that brought down US budget    deficits in the late 1990s.        59    00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.490    Some years later I was proud    to work with that committee        60    00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.750    when I was Director of the    Congressional Budget Office.        61    00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.060    After leaving the Congress,    Governor Kasich spent        62    00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.810    some years in the private sector.        63    00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.300    In 2010, he returned to public life        64    00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.890    by winning an election    as the Governor of Ohio.        65    00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.533    He was reelected in 2014 and    is in his second term now.        66    00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.770    As governor he has been    involved in a very wide range        67    00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.770    of policy issues, including    taxes, the role of labor unions,        68    00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.410    policing and criminal justice    reform, abortion rules,        69    00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.930    climate and other environmental policies,        70    00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.700    immigration and refugee    issues, and health care policy.        71    00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.210    Not surprisingly the    positions that Governor Kasich        72    00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.540    has taken on those various    issues have won approval        73    00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.370    from some people in Ohio and    disagreement from others,        74    00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.790    and the same is certainly    true by the people        75    00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.470    represented in this tent today.        76    00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.100    But one of the wonderful    and important principles        77    00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.840    of the Kennedy School    is that this is a place        78    00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.910    where people stand for their views        79    00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.320    and listen to others with different views        80    00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.223    with civility and respect.        81    00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.240    Governor Kasich joined        82    00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.240    the 2016 presidential race.    (audience applauding)        83    00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.780    Governor Kasich joined the    2016 presidential race.        84    00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.180    He won the Ohio Primary and    then suspended his campaign.        85    00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.770    After leaving the race,    he declined to support        86    00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.124    Donald Trump's candidacy and said instead,        87    00:05:02.124 --> 00:05:06.374    (audience cheering and applauding)        88    00:05:11.807 --> 00:05:15.340    and said instead that he had    voted for Senator John McCain.        89    00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.369    Governor Kasich has also been the author        90    00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:21.320    (audience cheering and applauding)        91    00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.570    of four bestselling books.        92    00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.420    The most recent is titled        93    00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.200    Two Paths: America United or Divided        94    00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.510    and reflects on his presidential campaign        95    00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.253    and his hopes for the future.        96    00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.200    In his State of the State address,        97    00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.370    delivered before the Ohio    Legislature this March,        98    00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.820    Governor Kasich appealed to all people        99    00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.560    to live according to the    values of compassion,        100    00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.430    humility, forgiveness,        101    00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.910    responsibility, justice, and respect        102    00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.280    and he applied those values to citizens        103    00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.777    and to public leaders,    emphasizing that quote,        104    00:05:59.777 --> 00:06:03.787    ""The worst thing in life    is not to lose an election,        105    00:06:03.787 --> 00:06:07.107    ""the worst thing in life    is to serve yourself        106    00:06:07.107 --> 00:06:09.963    ""instead of others,"" unquote.        107    00:06:10.893 --> 00:06:14.060    (audience applauding)        108    00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.600    I am delighted that our    graduation speaker this year        109    00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.490    is such a committed servant of others.        110    00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.710    It is my great honor and pleasure        111    00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.410    to introduce Governor John Kasich.        112    00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.330    (audience cheering and applauding)        113    00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.163    - Thank you.        114    00:06:39.512 --> 00:06:43.130    You know that was a lot of biography there        115    00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.790    but let me kind of tell you    the way that things worked.        116    00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.450    I did go to that small    university in the Midwest        117    00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.610    Ohio State.

(audience laughing)        150    00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.070    And I said well, if I go    back and write a letter        151    00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.390    would you give it to the President?        152    00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.300    He'd never seen me before but he said,        153    00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.390    I guess I could do that.        154    00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.790    So I went back to my dorm    and I did an analysis        155    00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:39.397    of the Nixon presidency,    and I signed it sincerely,        156    00:08:40.257 --> 00:08:43.100    John Kasich, P.S. if you    want to discuss this further,        157    00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.980    let me know, I've got time, I can come        158    00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.170    and see you, so    (audience laughing)        159    00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.050    a couple weeks later I    go down to my mailbox        160    00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.170    and open it up and sure    enough there's a letter        161    00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.590    from the White House, the    Office of the President.        162    00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.820    I read the letter, I go    upstairs to my dorm room,        163    00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.440    and I call home.        164    00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.810    And I said, Mom, listen, I'm    gonna need an airline ticket.        165    00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.140    The President of the    United States would like        166    00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.301    to have a meeting with    me in the Oval Office.        167    00:09:05.301 --> 00:09:06.500    (audience laughing)    Now my father        168    00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.830    carried mail when my mother    was in and out of work,        169    00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.600    depending on that how we were as kids.        170    00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.690    So they were not people    that were power players.        171    00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.160    Just simple folks playing by the rules        172    00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.490    and when I said that to my mother,        173    00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.540    she started screaming    honey, pick up the phone,        174    00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.290    there's something really    wrong with Johnny.        175    00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.620    So    (audience laughing)        176    00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.910    it started a debate about    whether this was real or not        177    00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.680    and my parents finally    decided they should just        178    00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.030    give me the airline ticket.        179    00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.843    So I flew down to Washington and I went        180    00:09:32.843 --> 00:09:35.200    to the White House gate    and they let me through        181    00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.600    and the next thing I know I'm sitting        182    00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.170    in the White House right    outside the Oval Office.        183    00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.353    And a guy walks up to me and he says,        184    00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:44.830    you're gonna get five minutes alone        185    00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.520    with the President of the United States.        186    00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.980    What do you think, young lady?        187    00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.320    Pretty impressive, huh?        188    00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.050    Yeah, I'll tell you what I'm thinking.        189    00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.450    I have a new jacket, new    shirt, new tie, new pants.        190    00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.300    I'm not coming out in five lousy minutes,        191    00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.100    they're outta luck.    (audience laughing)        192    00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.040    So they opened up the    door, and I walked in        193    00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.050    and there's the President.        194    00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.647    I greet the President    and he says sit down,        195    00:10:02.647 --> 00:10:06.880    and the good news is as a    18-year-old first quarter freshman        196    00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.620    I spent 20 minutes    alone with the President        197    00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.200    of the United States in the Oval Office.        198    00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.000    The bad news is,    (audience applauding)        199    00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.580    the bad news is I spent    18 years in Congress        200    00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.990    and if you add up all the time    I spent in the Oval Office,        201    00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:19.950    I peaked out at the age    of 18 and should have        202    00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.813    gone to Harvard.    (audience applauding)        203    00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.960    So I didn't really know what to expect        204    00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.230    when I came here today,    and I really didn't know        205    00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.903    what to expect with this kind of a crowd.        206    00:10:40.402 --> 00:10:42.053    I kinda know what I want to say.        207    00:10:43.813 --> 00:10:46.583    But this is not like a    public policy speech.        208    00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.610    This is a speech that was really frankly,        209    00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.990    or remarks that are frankly directed        210    00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.410    at a lot of the young    people that are here,        211    00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.010    but when I see the mix of the crowd        212    00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:00.320    I would hope that that    you would think about        213    00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.500    what I have to say today,        214    00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.603    the remarks that I'll make here today.        215    00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.990    And maybe take them home    in one way or another.        216    00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.860    You know, as you begin    to graduate from college        217    00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.480    and you have a lot of people    that are kind of getting sad,        218    00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.040    a little melancholy, right?        219    00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.680    I'm leaving this place, my roommates,        220    00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.710    and probably in the last few days        221    00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.750    you probably sat with    some of your best friends        222    00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.453    and talked about your lives.        223    00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:32.423    You talked about what    is the meaning of life?        224    00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:35.243    You go to a place like Harvard,        225    00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.410    which is the best of the best,        226    00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.370    and you are trying to decide        227    00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.600    how you're gonna navigate the real world.        228    00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.890    And we live in very uncertain times        229    00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.890    and the world at times can be confusing.        230    00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:54.520    So it's totally proper, it's    always proper to reflect back.        231    00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.820    And we do it at weddings,    and we do it at funerals,        232    00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.940    and we do it at solemn occasions.        233    00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.680    We do it when there's    special moments when we        234    00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.710    meet with those who we love and care about        235    00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:06.000    and talk about the meaning of life.        236    00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.523    And this frankly has gone on    since the beginning of time.        237    00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:14.450    And I've looked at the philosophers' view.        238    00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.210    The ones that thought    about things like this.        239    00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:21.380    Plato and Aristotle who talked    about the eternal nature        240    00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.220    of the soul and what is life all about.        241    00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.740    Is life pointed up?        242    00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.010    Is it here on the earth?        243    00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.980    They had great philosophical discussions        244    00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.680    back in ancient Greece in a glorious time.        245    00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.440    And then there was Jean-Jacques Rousseau        246    00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.730    who thought about life    and was the inspiration        247    00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.593    of the bloody French Revolution.        248    00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:47.610    There was Frederick Nietzsche    who examined the dark side        249    00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:51.870    of human nature and many    said was an inspiration        250    00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.853    for some of the darkest times    in the history of humanity.        251    00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:01.310    And then there was Camus,    the existentialist.        252    00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:04.030    Somebody said never in    the history of America        253    00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.700    did a governor ever get up at    a State of the State of speech        254    00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.980    and mention Camus, but    I'll do it again today.        255    00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.700    And if you can explain to me what it means        256    00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.200    to be an existentialist, send me a note.        257    00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.620    'Cause I still haven't figured it out.        258    00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.800    And then there was,    (audience laughing)        259    00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.670    then there was John Locke,        260    00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.223    natural law and the way    in which we should live.        261    00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.030    All very impressive people,        262    00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.800    worth spending some time thinking about.        263    00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.790    But I also spent time thinking    about the great theologians        264    00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.400    throughout the history of the world.        265    00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.230    There was Augustine, St. Augustine.        266    00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.510    He was my favorite because Augustine said,        267    00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:44.040    I know I need to turn my life over to God        268    00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.410    but I've got a couple good    parties I need to go to        269    00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.490    before I do that.    (audience laughing)        270    00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:52.020    And then there was    Aquinas, Thomas Aquinas,        271    00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.940    who laid out such an important principle        272    00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.850    for those that try to    study life and our Creator.        273    00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:01.200    And he combined both faith and reason.        274    00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.230    He said they were like    two wings of a bird.        275    00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.590    Blind faith doesn't work, faith    without reason doesn't work,        276    00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.380    but reason without faith doesn't work.        277    00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.340    And then there was Martin Luther.        278    00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.930    Martin Luther dared to    challenge the church,        279    00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:19.420    and in fact it was such a powerful message        280    00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.480    that the Pope and political leaders        281    00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.853    sent out people to actually    capture Martin Luther.        282    00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.830    And then there was William Wilberforce,        283    00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.400    one of the great inspirations I think        284    00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.230    in modern human history.        285    00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.810    He is the man that worked    to not only abolish        286    00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:41.470    the slave trade in Great    Britain, but he was also involved        287    00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:46.430    in creating a notion of    manners, a notion of culture,        288    00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:49.550    a notion of how we needed    to treat one another.        289    00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.720    So I'm sure there are people here today        290    00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.830    who are humanists and have studied this        291    00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.510    to try to think about their own lives.        292    00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.750    And for the people who get up every day        293    00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.430    and say they want to build a better world,        294    00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.420    I'm totally sympathetic and    in agreement and I honor that,        295    00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.960    but for me it won't work.        296    00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.660    It won't work because the winds of change        297    00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:16.460    and the fads and the culture    knocked me off my bearings.        298    00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.940    I need to have a compass.        299    00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.750    When I go and hike with    my friends, my spouse,        300    00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.430    and we get missed, we can't figure out        301    00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.400    where we are in the woods, I'm    not particularly interested        302    00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.670    in their opinion about how we get out.        303    00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:32.270    I want to know who's carrying the compass,        304    00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:36.850    and I know that I need to    have a compass in my life.        305    00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.840    But I also know at the    same time I go deeper        306    00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.900    and throw in with the    theologians in terms of my life,        307    00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.810    I also know that when I think about that        308    00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:49.470    that human reason itself is imperfect.        309    00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.560    We can never figure it all out.        310    00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.950    So I've decided to throw    in with the theologians        311    00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:58.460    rather than the existentialists    and Jean-Jacques Rousseau        312    00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:03.260    or Aristotle and Plato,    although I look at them as well.        313    00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:07.240    I have been persuaded by studying    and thinking and observing        314    00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.560    over the course of my lifetime        315    00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.570    that there's so much more to life.        316    00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.860    And here's what's so interesting.        317    00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.820    Christians and Jews and Muslims        318    00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:22.310    all basically have the    same view of human life.        319    00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.100    That human life is special.        320    00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:29.010    That human life is above    all other human life,        321    00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:33.010    and that the Creator    created this human life        322    00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:37.010    and made it above all    else and that is our duty        323    00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.810    to reflect the character of our Creator        324    00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.160    and to recognize that every human being        325    00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.530    is made in the image of our Creator.        326    00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:49.110    And if you think about it for    a second, just that concept,        327    00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:51.450    whether you buy it or    not, think about the fact        328    00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:54.600    that if we are all made    in the image of God,        329    00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.240    all made in the image of our Creator,        330    00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.650    we have no right to dismiss or alienate        331    00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:03.240    any other human being.        332    00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.620    It means that we must show respect,        333    00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:09.300    something that I think    we all yearn for today.        334    00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.520    And when we are...    (audience applauding)        335    00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.430    Now when I come to Harvard,        336    00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.240    or been out in the Silicon Valley        337    00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:25.240    or been in Europe and I have    mentioned that word God,        338    00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.780    if I were to look at    all the thought bubbles        339    00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:32.390    across this assemblage today,    I'd see a lot of things        340    00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.560    that are contradictory in some ways        341    00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.880    and maybe sometimes negative.        342    00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.820    But I want to tell you    what I think it means        343    00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.610    to put forth and adopt and try to portray        344    00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:48.270    the character of our Creator.        345    00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:52.370    You see in many respects,    religious authorities        346    00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.080    have done more to create a negative view        347    00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.200    of what the Lord wants than    those who have no faith at all.        348    00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.240    And let me suggest to you    (audience applauding)        349    00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.680    that when I look at these values,        350    00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.080    they're pretty simple to me.        351    00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:11.420    They're love, whether it    is Old or New Testament.        352    00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.700    You know, and they had    a lot of brilliance.        353    00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:13.680    They took the old and the new        354    00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.460    and they put it into one book        355    00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.320    and if you search that book        356    00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.330    you will find that it is all about love.        357    00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:25.147    It's about love, it is about compassion,        358    00:18:25.147 --> 00:18:30.147    it is about humility,    it is about forgiveness,        359    00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:34.940    it is about responsibility,    it is about justice,        360    00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.250    it is about respect for others,        361    00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:39.320    it's about personal responsibility        362    00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.170    but fundamentally it    is about living a life        363    00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.260    a little bigger than ourselves.        364    00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:48.930    It really is about treating    others and loving others,        365    00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:50.690    which means doing good for others        366    00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.040    even when you have no self-interest.        367    00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.090    It's about doing that    because that is the way        368    00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:58.240    that you expect to be treated.        369    00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.020    That is what faith is.        370    00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.220    That is the underpinning    of what allowed us        371    00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:08.220    to adopt a set of virtues so    that we could self govern.        372    00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.830    Now I happen to believe those virtues        373    00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.530    are written on our hearts.        374    00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:14.320    I think we carry them around.        375    00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.320    I think they're instinctive,        376    00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.910    and let me give you a    few examples of this.        377    00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:22.590    It wasn't long ago when we looked        378    00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:26.090    at the horrible flooding    in Houston, Texas.        379    00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.390    We saw people that were hanging on trees        380    00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.530    or hanging on their roofs of their homes,        381    00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.960    and we saw people who    didn't even live in Texas        382    00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.350    put their little boats    on the top of their cars        383    00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:41.270    and drive to Houston,    Texas and rescue people off        384    00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.940    of their roofs and out of the    trees and to save their lives.        385    00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.800    And we saw a great sports    figure by the name of J.J. Watt        386    00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.040    who decided he needed to    raise millions and millions        387    00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.150    of dollars for people that he never met.        388    00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.830    His life was not moving so fast,        389    00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.320    he was embracing something much deeper.        390    00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.810    And it wasn't long ago    and how soon we can forget        391    00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:09.230    this horrible gunman in Las Vegas        392    00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:12.360    and this gunman opened up fire        393    00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.150    with every weapon that we can think of,        394    00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:18.630    turning semi-automatics    into fully automatic weapons        395    00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:23.630    and from a hotel window    gunning down innocent people        396    00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:28.060    who just went to Las Vegas    to enjoy a country show        397    00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:31.290    where they could be together    with the people they love.        398    00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.930    And as those bullets rung    out, there are untold stories        399    00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:39.000    and many told stories of    people who threw their bodies        400    00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.780    to cover those who could have been hit.        401    00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.220    In other words they put    their lives in jeopardy        402    00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.100    to serve someone else and    many of them had no clue        403    00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.200    who the stranger was sitting next to them.        404    00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:55.063    You see, that was where those    values were shining through.        405    00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:01.356    How about those young students    down in Parkland, Florida?        406    00:21:01.356 --> 00:21:02.480    (audience applauding)    How about the efforts        407    00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:07.480    that they are making to    stand up and to speak out,        408    00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.810    and those people in Parkland, Florida        409    00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:13.630    who put their lives in jeopardy.        410    00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.210    We had a school shooting in my state        411    00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.680    and we had a number of teachers    that ran down the hallway        412    00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.740    to push the gunman out of the building,        413    00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.563    putting their lives at risk.        414    00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:27.733    Heroes?        415    00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.510    Maybe recognizing some of    these instinctive virtues        416    00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.523    that we have written on our hearts.        417    00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:37.700    The state of Texas.        418    00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:42.520    The stories of people who    put their lives on the line        419    00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.410    to block students from the bullets        420    00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:48.460    that were being fired from    a 17-year-old's shotgun        421    00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.970    and one more time J.J. Watt showed up        422    00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:55.890    to comfort the people    who were in the hospital,        423    00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.730    to raise money to pay    for the funerals of those        424    00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:00.040    who had been stricken down.        425    00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:05.040    Yes, it's pretty remarkable    when we think about the fact        426    00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.440    that those virtues are    written on our hearts        427    00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.873    and when we see them, we know how to act.        428    00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.470    I happen to believe that when    we recognize those virtues        429    00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:17.390    of love and compassion and    humility and living a life        430    00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:19.343    a little bigger than ourselves,        431    00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.100    it can guide us to lead a simple life.        432    00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.990    I have to tell you, being    Governor of my state        433    00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:28.130    has really been relatively easy.        434    00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:30.670    I mean we're the seventh largest state,        435    00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:34.190    but my whole team is    operated under the notion        436    00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:37.033    not that we're saints or    anything like that, forget it.        437    00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:42.680    Operated under the notion    that if we follow those values        438    00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:46.040    we can help not only those    at the top to be successful        439    00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:49.410    but those at the bottom to be    successful and to have hope.        440    00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:53.070    So it's made it easy to make    decisions in public life        441    00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.840    because who's cheering for you today        442    00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.330    is booing you tomorrow and    who's booing you tomorrow        443    00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:58.720    is cheering you today.        444    00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.890    That's why you need the compass.        445    00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:03.530    But I have to also suggest        446    00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:06.390    that when you follow these    virtues and these values,        447    00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.380    it can come with a big cost.        448    00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.330    When we think about Martin Luther King.        449    00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:17.280    Just walked from the train    station in Washington        450    00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.493    to the Lincoln Memorial.        451    00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.500    As I approached the Lincoln Memorial,        452    00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:28.457    I saw in my mind's eye    that I Have a Dream speech.        453    00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.870    Martin Luther King would never respond        454    00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:36.250    violence for violence.        455    00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:40.230    He believed that the higher    moral purpose would win.        456    00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:44.780    He wrote a letter from Birmingham    in jail that no law of man        457    00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:48.353    that doesn't square with the    moral law of God is just,        458    00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:53.883    and they gunned him down,    but the dream lives on.        459    00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.313    Dietrich Bonhoeffer.        460    00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.630    When there were too many in the world        461    00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:05.090    that turned their backs on the Holocaust,        462    00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.020    Dietrich Bonhoeffer had left Germany        463    00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.200    and had moved to New    York and he recognized        464    00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.760    the fact that I cannot go back and pastor        465    00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.410    to anybody in my country if I don't return        466    00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.483    in the middle of the Nazi occupation.        467    00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:25.060    He was hung from a tree    just a matter of days        468    00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.493    before the end of the war,        469    00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:31.520    but as he was heading to the    gallows he inspired his captors        470    00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:36.700    to say there was more to    life than just success,        471    00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.003    that there was more to    life, something deeper,        472    00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.780    and read his stories.        473    00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:45.640    Or Natan Sharansky, he was    a prisoner of conscience        474    00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.410    living in a Soviet gulag and all he wanted        475    00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.840    was for the Jews to be    released from the Soviet Union.        476    00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.800    And they said to him, and    they put him in prison,        477    00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.300    and they said to him if    you will just confess        478    00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.210    a little bit we will release you.        479    00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:02.853    After all, Galileo recanted.        480    00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:06.660    And Natan Sharansky thought about it        481    00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:11.660    in the dark of the gulag,    sleeping with rats to stay warm,        482    00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:17.310    no meager resources to be    able to sustain himself        483    00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:22.990    he thought to himself if    they use Galileo against me,        484    00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.383    they will never use me    against someone else.        485    00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.163    And he told him to go to hell.        486    00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.620    Well, Sharansky was ultimately released        487    00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:38.300    and he was on a bridge    and the Soviet authorities        488    00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.830    told Sharansky I want    you to walk straight.        489    00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:44.230    And Ash Carter knows this story.        490    00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.950    As he walked across that bridge        491    00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:49.610    he could not move in a more    crooked line than what he did.        492    00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:54.120    His final message of defiance        493    00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.893    to those that held him captive.        494    00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.193    But it's not always the big shots.        495    00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.853    So you work at Wells Fargo.        496    00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:04.993    They tell you to open up a phony account.        497    00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.163    I'm not opening one.        498    00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.453    What happens, you lose your job?        499    00:26:15.472 --> 00:26:17.150    Is that the end of it?        500    00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:18.570    Do you need to cling to that        501    00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:20.170    that just makes you comfortable?        502    00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.500    But are you willing to get    out of your comfort zone?        503    00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.170    Or the story of those people that dragged        504    00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.620    that human being off that airplane?        505    00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:32.070    And I said to somebody why did somebody        506    00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:33.940    at the ticket counter not stand up        507    00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.940    and say I won't put up with this?        508    00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:40.280    And somebody told me,    well, they have a mortgage,        509    00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.113    they have a job.        510    00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.660    See there's a guy in the Old Testament        511    00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.083    by the name of Daniel.        512    00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.513    They put him in the lion's den.        513    00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.513    Guess what, we all enter the lion's den.        514    00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.763    It's just a matter of how we    handle it when we're there.        515    00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.223    You see there is a price    to pay for standing up,        516    00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:09.120    but when you do stand up        517    00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:15.670    you go down in the memory,    the minds of people around you        518    00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:20.163    as a hero, as an inspiration.        519    00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.483    You know, look, we all fail.        520    00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.993    We're all hypocrites.        521    00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.430    I was at the Boston Globe    earlier today at editorial board.        522    00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:33.110    I said I'll be the number-one hypocrite        523    00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:35.950    but what I have to say about    virtue doesn't nullify it        524    00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:38.270    because I can't live it.        525    00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:40.650    The fact that I can't live these values        526    00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:44.290    does not make those values    wrong or those virtues wrong.        527    00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:48.010    I have a responsibility    but I'm weak and I'm flawed        528    00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:49.573    and I can't do it,        529    00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:55.200    until tomorrow or maybe next week        530    00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.150    when I can finally brush myself off        531    00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:00.353    and get enough courage to    stand tall at least for a day.        532    00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:04.950    Because we see today in our society,        533    00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:09.873    whether it is speed of life    or ego or position or money,        534    00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:13.093    it's infecting our whole culture.        535    00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.260    And we tend to want to    think about politics,        536    00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.243    those bunch of bums, okay?        537    00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:20.823    I understand that.        538    00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.870    But you know we spend    time thinking about them        539    00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:26.720    because sometimes we    don't want to think about        540    00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.140    what we're doing, where we live,        541    00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.143    how we're carrying out our lives.        542    00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:34.033    You know I've mentioned Wells Fargo.        543    00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:37.180    How about virtue in profit.        544    00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.720    Oh, the Pope's controversial now        545    00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.860    'cause he said they think    he doesn't like capitalism.        546    00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.490    Michael Novak, the great    Catholic theologian        547    00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:47.390    and philosopher, said that    any free enterprise system        548    00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:50.110    that is not underlaid by a    set of values is bankrupt,        549    00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:53.845    and I buy it, I buy it.    (audience lightly applauding)        550    00:28:53.845 --> 00:28:56.470    If you're in business, and you're a leader        551    00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:59.810    and you're a CEO or some big shot,        552    00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.520    what are you doing to    remember those virtues?        553    00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.330    Stop talking about the politicians,        554    00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:07.253    let's talk about the people    that are in the corner office.        555    00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:12.160    Sports, we look at the NCAA, ha!

       661    00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.490    You fix it where you live    and you knit together        662    00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:25.040    in a network of people who seek the truth        663    00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.980    who are objective and rational    and you put them together        664    00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.773    and you build a network and a league.        665    00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:34.620    And you'll fix the country.        666    00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:37.160    See the Civil Rights Movement didn't get        667    00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.963    fixed from the top down.        668    00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:43.100    It started with a woman who    moved from the back of the bus        669    00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:46.410    to the front of the bus and sent a message        670    00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:49.203    to the entire world about human dignity.        671    00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:54.280    The church leaders would not say no        672    00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.610    and they forced action    with the politicians,        673    00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:00.340    and frankly that's how    the Vietnam War ended.        674    00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:02.520    Because people on these college campuses        675    00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:06.480    all over America said    enough, we're not in.        676    00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.915    They drove it from the bottom up.        677    00:35:08.915 --> 00:35:11.200    And you want to change this    world, we need to work together        678    00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.380    and drive it from the bottom up,        679    00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:16.240    and hoping that those people    who are in the corner offices        680    00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:20.700    will greet us halfway and    begin to transform the world        681    00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:21.783    in which they live.        682    00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:26.160    Now for the old fogies    here, the baby boomers,        683    00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.950    those that are not quite baby boomers,        684    00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:32.123    my hopes in the millennials,    these graduates today,        685    00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.670    I hate this, I don't    know if they learned it        686    00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.780    from our failures or whatever,        687    00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.313    but they're not in it for the money.        688    00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:47.673    I was over at IBM    yesterday at Watson Health.        689    00:35:48.587 --> 00:35:51.760    A guy was there, he was    saying you know my daughter,        690    00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:52.700    she doesn't want to work here.        691    00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.960    She wants to go work at Patagonia        692    00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.410    'cause she thinks there's more    there's more meaning in that.        693    00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:59.180    That's what she wants to do.        694    00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:02.950    Our millennials are in    search of more meaning,        695    00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:04.750    of trying to make a big difference        696    00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:08.160    in the way the world works.        697    00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.550    You see my hope is in us,        698    00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:12.550    but our my hope is really    in the millennials,        699    00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:15.830    all of you who are here today    who are gonna graduate from        700    00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:20.010    a prestigious university where    you have automatic power.        701    00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:24.970    I believe in you and I want    you to believe in yourselves,        702    00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:27.220    that you can change the way        703    00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.850    that the world turns on its axis.        704    00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:33.050    You can, you will, you must.        705    00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:34.370    We're counting on you.        706    00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:36.584    Good luck and God bless you.        707    00:36:36.584 --> 00:36:37.417    (audience applauding)        "

00:01:11.260    Harvard.        7    00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.570    Class of 2017, congratulations!        8    00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:26.650    I'm an unlikely speaker, not just because    I dropped out, but because we're technically        9    00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.400    in the same generation.        10    00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.010    We walked this yard less than a decade apart,    studied the same ideas and slept through the        11    00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.870    same Ec10 lectures.        12    00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.150    We may have taken different paths to get here,    especially if you came all the way from the        13    00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.810    Quad, but today I want to share what I've    learned about our generation and the world        14    00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.830    we're building together.        15    00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.500    But first, the last couple of days have brought    back a lot of good memories.        16    00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.600    How many of you remember exactly what you    were doing when you got that email telling        17    00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:13.140    you that you got into Harvard?        18    00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.640    I was playing Civilization and I ran downstairs,    got my dad, and for some reason, his reaction        19    00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.650    was to video me opening the email.        20    00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.310    That could have been a really sad video.        21    00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:36.569    I swear getting into Harvard is still the    thing my parents are most proud of me for.        22    00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:52.000    What about     your first lecture at Harvard?        23    00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.689    Mine was Computer Science 121 with the incredible    Harry Lewis.        24    00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:07.389    I was late so I threw on a t-shirt and didn't    realize until afterwards it was inside out        25    00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.609    and backwards with my tag sticking out the    front.        26    00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:19.120    I couldn't figure out why no one would talk    to me -- except one guy, KX Jin, he just went        27    00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.180    with it.        28    00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.290    We ended up doing our problem sets together,    and now he runs a big part of Facebook.        29    00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:34.669    And that, Class of 2017, is why you should    be nice to people.        30    00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:44.159    But my best memory from Harvard was meeting    Priscilla.        31    00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:55.200    I had just launched this prank website Facemash,    and the ad board wanted to ""see me"".        32    00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.349    Everyone thought I was going to get kicked    out.        33    00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.189    My parents came to help me pack.        34    00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:07.010    My friends threw me a going away party.        35    00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.099    As luck would have it, Priscilla was at that    party with her friend.        36    00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.960    We met in line for the bathroom in the Pfoho    Belltower, and in what must be one of the        37    00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.060    all time romantic lines, I said: ""I'm going    to get kicked out in three days, so we need        38    00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.100    to go on a date quickly.""        39    00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:32.580    Actually, any of you graduating can use that    line.        40    00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:41.770    I didn't end up getting kicked out -- I did    that to myself.        41    00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.380    Priscilla and I started dating.        42    00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.930    And, you know, that movie made it seem like    Facemash was so important to creating Facebook.        43    00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.590    It wasn't.        44    00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.680    But without Facemash I wouldn't have met Priscilla,    and she's the most important person in my        45    00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:08.400    life, so you could say it was the most important    thing I built in my time here.        46    00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:20.199    We've all started lifelong friendships here,    and some of us even families.        47    00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.540    That's why I'm so grateful to this place.        48    00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.490    Thanks, Harvard.        49    00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.970    Today I want to talk about purpose.        50    00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.680    But I'm not here to give you the standard    commencement about finding your purpose.        51    00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.250    We're millennials.        52    00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.830    We'll try to do that instinctively.        53    00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:50.229    Instead, I'm here to tell you finding your    purpose isn't enough.        54    00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:57.080    The challenge for our generation is creating    a world where everyone has a sense of purpose.        55    00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:04.680    One of my favorite stories is when John F    Kennedy visited the NASA space center, he        56    00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.870    saw a janitor carrying a broom and he walked    over and asked what he was doing.        57    00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:14.710    The janitor responded: ""Mr. President, I'm    helping put a man on the moon"".        58    00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:21.560    Purpose is that sense that we are part of    something bigger than ourselves, that we are        59    00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.169    needed, that we have something better ahead    to work for.        60    00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.520    Purpose is what creates true happiness.        61    00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.830    You're graduating at a time when this is especially    important.        62    00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:43.000    When our parents graduated, purpose reliably    came from your job, your church, your community.        63    00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.569    But today, technology and automation are eliminating    many jobs.        64    00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:51.060    Membership in communities is declining.        65    00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:57.990    Many people feel disconnected and depressed,    and are trying to fill a void.        66    00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.439    As I've traveled around, I've sat with children    in juvenile detention and opioid addicts,        67    00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:07.479    who told me their lives could have turned    out differently if they just had something        68    00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:12.069    to do, an after school program or somewhere    to go.        69    00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:15.909    I've met factory workers who know their old    jobs aren't coming back and are trying to        70    00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:17.879    find their place.        71    00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:25.460    To keep our society moving forward, we have    a generational challenge -- to not only create        72    00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.749    new jobs, but create a renewed sense of purpose.        73    00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:40.990    I remember the night I launched Facebook from    my little dorm in Kirkland House.        74    00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.930    I went to Noch's with my friend KX.        75    00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:50.870    I remember telling him I was excited to connect    the Harvard community, but one day someone        76    00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.620    would connect the whole world.        77    00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.409    The thing is, it never even occurred to me    that someone might be us.        78    00:07:57.409 --> 00:07:58.919    We were just college kids.        79    00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:00.770    We didn't know anything about that.        80    00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.380    There were all these big technology companies    with resources.        81    00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.199    I just assumed one of them would do it.        82    00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:12.300    But this idea was so clear to us -- that all    people want to connect.        83    00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:17.020    So we just kept moving forward, day by day.        84    00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.290    I know a lot of you will have your own stories    just like this.        85    00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:28.160    A change in the world that seems so clear    you're sure someone else will do it.        86    00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.430    But they won't.        87    00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.440    You will.        88    00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.909    But it's not enough to have purpose yourself.        89    00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:39.140    You have to create a sense of purpose for    others.        90    00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.200    I found that out the hard way.        91    00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:47.600    You see, my hope was never to build a company,    but to make an impact.        92    00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.790    And as all these people started joining us,    I just assumed that's what they cared about        93    00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:57.450    too, so I never explained what I hoped we'd    build.        94    00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:01.510    A couple years in, some big companies wanted    to buy us.        95    00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.130    I didn't want to sell.        96    00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:05.980    I wanted to see if we could connect more people.        97    00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:11.171    We were building the first News Feed, and    I thought if we could just launch this, it        98    00:09:11.171 --> 00:09:15.140    could change how we learn about the world.        99    00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.840    Nearly everyone else wanted to sell.        100    00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.390    Without a sense of higher purpose, this was    the startup dream come true.        101    00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.100    It tore our company apart.        102    00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:33.290    After one tense argument, an advisor told    me if I didn't agree to sell, I would regret        103    00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:37.080    the decision for the rest of my life.        104    00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:42.870    Relationships were so frayed that within a    year or so every single person on the management        105    00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.830    team was gone.        106    00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.760    That was my hardest time leading Facebook.        107    00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.360    I believed in what we were doing, but I felt    alone.        108    00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.640    And worse, it was my fault.        109    00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:05.580    I wondered if I was just wrong, an imposter,    a 22 year-old kid who had no idea how the        110    00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.580    world worked.        111    00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:13.970    Now, years later, I understand that *is* how    things work with no sense of higher purpose.        112    00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:20.820    It's up to us to create it so we can all keep    moving forward together.        113    00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:28.700    Today I want to talk about three ways to create    a world where everyone has a sense of purpose:        114    00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:35.380    by taking on big meaningful projects together,    by redefining equality so everyone has the        115    00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:41.950    freedom to pursue purpose, and by building    community across the world.        116    00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:47.590    First, let's take on big meaningful projects.        117    00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:51.830    Our generation will have to deal with tens    of millions of jobs replaced by automation        118    00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.280    like self-driving cars and trucks.        119    00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.200    But we have the potential to do so much more    together.        120    00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.980    Every generation has its defining works.        121    00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:06.000    More than 300,000 people worked to put a man    on the moon \'96 including that janitor.        122    00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.790    Millions of volunteers immunized children    around the world against polio.        123    00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.631    Millions of more people built the Hoover dam    and other great projects.        124    00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:13.740    These projects didn't just provide purpose    for the people doing those jobs, they gave        125    00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.740    our whole country a sense of pride that we    could do great things.        126    00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:18.140    Now it's our turn to do great things.        127    00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:23.840    I know, you're probably thinking: I don't    know how to build a dam, or get a million        128    00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.180    people involved in anything.        129    00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:33.700    But let me tell you a secret: no one does    when they begin.        130    00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.690    Ideas don't come out fully formed.        131    00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.880    They only become clear as you work on them.        132    00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.410    You just have to get started.        133    00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:49.070    If I had to understand everything about connecting    people before I began, I never would have        134    00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.870    started Facebook.        135    00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.110    Movies and pop culture get this all wrong.        136    00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:58.930    The idea of a single eureka moment is a dangerous    lie.        137    00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:03.430    It makes us feel inadequate since we haven't    had ours.        138    00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:09.020    It prevents people with seeds of good ideas    from getting started.        139    00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:13.640    Oh, you know what else movies get wrong about    innovation?        140    00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:18.800    No one writes math formulas on glass.        141    00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.200    That's not a thing.        142    00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:28.640    It's good to be idealistic.        143    00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.300    But be prepared to be misunderstood.        144    00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:38.860    Anyone working on a big vision will get called    crazy, even if you end up right.        145    00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:44.060    Anyone working on a complex problem will get    blamed for not fully understanding the challenge,        146    00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.090    even though it's impossible to know everything    upfront.        147    00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:53.020    Anyone taking initiative will get criticized    for moving too fast, because there's always        148    00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.890    someone who wants to slow you down.        149    00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:02.930    In our society, we often don't do big things    because we're so afraid of making mistakes        150    00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:07.860    that we ignore all the things wrong today    if we do nothing.        151    00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:14.230    The reality is, anything we do will have issues    in the future.        152    00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:19.440    But that can't keep us from starting.        153    00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.260    So what are we waiting for?        154    00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:25.890    It's time for our generation-defining public    works.        155    00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:30.240    How about stopping climate change before we    destroy the planet and getting millions of        156    00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:37.000    people involved manufacturing and installing    solar panels?        157    00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.760    How about curing all diseases and asking volunteers    to track their health data and share their        158    00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.450    genomes?        159    00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:53.850    Today we spend 50x more treating people who    are sick than we spend finding cures so people        160    00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:55.270    don't get sick in the first place.        161    00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.220    That makes no sense.        162    00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.280    We can fix this.        163    00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:10.820    How about modernizing democracy so everyone    can vote online, and personalizing education        164    00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.520    so everyone can learn?        165    00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.040    These achievements are within our reach.        166    00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:23.450    Let's do them all in a way that gives everyone    in our society a role.        167    00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:36.100    Let's do big things, not only to create progress,    but to create purpose.        168    00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:41.070    So taking on big meaningful projects is the    first thing we can do to create a world where        169    00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.720    everyone has a sense of purpose.        170    00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:54.080    The second is redefining equality to give    everyone the freedom they need to pursue purpose.        171    00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.290    Many of our parents had stable jobs throughout    their careers.        172    00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:03.520    Now we're all entrepreneurial, whether we're    starting projects or finding or role.        173    00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.230    And that's great.        174    00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:09.920    Our culture of entrepreneurship is how we    create so much progress.        175    00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:17.660    Now, an entrepreneurial culture thrives when    it's easy to try lots of new ideas.        176    00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.050    Facebook wasn't the first thing I built.        177    00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:24.370    I also built games, chat systems, study tools    and music players.        178    00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:25.560    I'm not alone.        179    00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:32.700    JK Rowling got rejected 12 times before publishing    Harry Potter.        180    00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:41.320    Even Beyonce had to make hundreds of songs    to get Halo.        181    00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:47.480    The greatest successes come from having the    freedom to fail.        182    00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:58.410    But today, we have a level of wealth inequality    that hurts everyone.        183    00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:05.140    When you don't have the freedom to take your    idea and turn it into a historic enterprise,        184    00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.670    we all lose.        185    00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:14.420    Right now our society is way over-indexed    on rewarding success and we don't do nearly        186    00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.180    enough to make it easy for everyone to take    lots of shots.        187    00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.720    Let's face it.        188    00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:26.410    There is something wrong with our system when    I can leave here and make billions of dollars        189    00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:31.990    in 10 years while millions of students can't    afford to pay off their loans, let alone start        190    00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:36.670    a business.        191    00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:46.510    Look, I know a lot of entrepreneurs, and I    don't know a single person who gave up on        192    00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:51.130    starting a business because they might not    make enough money.        193    00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:56.510    But I know lots of people who haven't pursued    dreams because they didn't have a cushion        194    00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:04.640    to fall back on if they failed.        195    00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.170    We all know we don't succeed just by having    a good idea or working hard.        196    00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:13.260    We succeed by being lucky too.        197    00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:19.339    If I had to support my family growing up instead    of having time to code, if I didn't know I'd        198    00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:25.089    be fine if Facebook didn't work out, I wouldn't    be standing here today.        199    00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:33.070    If we're honest, we all know how much luck    we've had.        200    00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:38.470    Every generation expands its definition of    equality.        201    00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:42.450    Previous generations fought for the vote and    civil rights.        202    00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:46.480    They had the New Deal and Great Society.        203    00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:57.660    Now it's our time to define a new social contract    for our generation.        204    00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:04.190    We should have a society that measures progress    not just by economic metrics like GDP, but        205    00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:07.890    by how many of us have a role we find meaningful.        206    00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:13.380    We should explore ideas like universal basic    income to give everyone a cushion to try new        207    00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.770    things.        208    00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:22.070    We\'92re going to change jobs many times,    so we need affordable childcare to get to        209    00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:30.020    work and healthcare that aren't tied to one    company.        210    00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:34.700    We're all going to make mistakes, so we need    a society that focuses less on locking us        211    00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.290    up or stigmatizing us.        212    00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:45.140    And as technology keeps changing, we need    to focus more on continuous education throughout        213    00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:54.120    our lives.\    And yes, giving everyone the freedom to pursue        214    00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.400    purpose isn't free.        215    00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.200    People like me should pay for it.        216    00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:06.760    Many of you will do well and you should too.        217    00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:16.160    That's why Priscilla and I started the Chan    Zuckerberg Initiative and committed our wealth        218    00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.920    to promoting equal opportunity.        219    00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:27.210    These are the values of our generation.        220    00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:31.540    It was never a question of if we were going    to do this.        221    00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.570    The only question was when.        222    00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:39.270    Millennials are already one of the most charitable    generations in history.        223    00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:46.480    In one year, three of four US millennials    made a donation and seven out of ten raised        224    00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.960    money for charity.        225    00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.110    But it's not just about money.        226    00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.470    You can also give time.        227    00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:59.970    I promise you, if you take an hour or two    a week -- that's all it takes to give someone        228    00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:02.300    a hand, to help them reach their potential.        229    00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:08.580    Maybe you think that's too much time.        230    00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.240    I used to.        231    00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:16.110    When Priscilla graduated from Harvard she    became a teacher, and before she'd do education        232    00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:21.970    work with me, she told me I needed to teach    a class.        233    00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.780    I complained: ""Well, I'm kind of busy.        234    00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.890    I'm running this company.""        235    00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:35.760    But she insisted, so I taught a middle school    program on entrepreneurship at the local Boys        236    00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.390    and Girls Club.        237    00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:45.950    I taught them lessons on product development    and marketing, and they taught me what it's        238    00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:54.360    like feeling targeted for your race and having    a family member in prison.        239    00:20:54.360 --> 00:21:01.760    I shared stories from my time in school, and    they shared their hope of one day going to        240    00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.630    college too.        241    00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:11.480    For five years now, I\'92ve been having dinner    with those kids every month.        242    00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.710    One of them threw me and Priscilla our first    baby shower.        243    00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.430    And next year they\'92re going to college.        244    00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:23.620    Every one of them.        245    00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.960    First in their families.        246    00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.840    We can all make time to give someone a hand.        247    00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.840    Let's give everyone the freedom to pursue    their purpose -- not only because it's the        248    00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:39.100    right thing to do, but because when more people    can turn their dreams into something great,        249    00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:49.990    we're all better for it.        250    00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:53.580    Purpose doesn't only come from work.        251    00:21:53.580 --> 00:22:00.240    The third way we can create a sense of purpose    for everyone is by building community.        252    00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:07.620    And when our generation says ""everyone"", we    mean everyone in the world.        253    00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:13.950    Quick show of hands: how many of you are from    another country?        254    00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:21.580    Now, how many of you are friends with one    of these folks?        255    00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.809    Now we're talking.        256    00:22:23.809 --> 00:22:29.900    We have grown up connected.\    In a survey asking millennials around the        257    00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:37.630    world what defines our identity, the most    popular answer wasn't nationality, religion        258    00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:41.890    or ethnicity, it was ""citizen of the world"".        259    00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:44.760    That's a big deal.        260    00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.630    Every generation expands the circle of people    we consider ""one of us"".        261    00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:56.270    For us, it now encompasses the entire world.        262    00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:02.320    We understand the great arc of human history    bends towards people coming together in ever        263    00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:08.070    greater numbers -- from tribes to cities to    nations -- to achieve things we couldn't on        264    00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:09.930    our own.        265    00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:14.420    We get that our greatest opportunities are    now global -- we can be the generation that        266    00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.570    ends poverty, that ends disease.        267    00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:24.180    We get that our greatest challenges need global    responses too -- no country can fight climate        268    00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.990    change alone or prevent pandemics.        269    00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:34.610    Progress now requires coming together not    just as cities or nations, but also as a global        270    00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:37.500    community.        271    00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.980    But we live in an unstable time.        272    00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:46.290    There are people left behind by globalization    across the world.        273    00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:51.090    It's hard to care about people in other places    if we don't feel good about our lives here        274    00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:53.670    at home.        275    00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.940    There's pressure to turn inwards.        276    00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:00.020    This is the struggle of our time.        277    00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:06.760    The forces of freedom, openness and global    community against the forces of authoritarianism,        278    00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.900    isolationism and nationalism.        279    00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:16.030    Forces for the flow of knowledge, trade and    immigration against those who would slow them        280    00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.520    down.        281    00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:25.010    This is not a battle of nations, it's a battle    of ideas.        282    00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:32.040    There are people in every country for global    connection and good people against it.        283    00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.520    This isn't going to be decided at the UN either.        284    00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:42.190    It's going to happen at the local level, when    enough of us feel a sense of purpose and stability        285    00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:47.280    in our own lives that we can open up and start    caring about everyone.        286    00:24:47.280 --> 00:25:05.250    The best way to do that is to start building    local communities right now.        287    00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:27.929    We all get meaning from our communities.        288    00:25:27.929 --> 00:25:33.420    Whether our communities are houses or sports    teams, churches or music groups, they give        289    00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:39.800    us that sense we are part of something bigger,    that we are not alone; they give us the strength        290    00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.120    to expand our horizons.        291    00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:50.520    That's why it's so striking that for decades,    membership in all kinds of groups has declined        292    00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.500    as much as one-quarter.        293    00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.340    That's a lot of people who now need to find    purpose somewhere else.        294    00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:02.809    But I know we can rebuild our communities    and start new ones because many of you already        295    00:26:02.809 --> 00:26:05.710    are.        296    00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:10.559    I met Agnes Igoye, who's graduating today.        297    00:26:10.559 --> 00:26:15.510    Where are you, Agnes?        298    00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:24.580    She spent her childhood navigating conflict    zones in Uganda, and now she trains thousands        299    00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:36.150    of law enforcement officers to keep communities    safe.        300    00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:41.730    I met Kayla Oakley and Niha Jain, graduating    today, too.        301    00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:43.770    Stand up.        302    00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:51.300    Kayla and Niha started a non-profit that connects    people suffering from illnesses with people        303    00:26:51.300 --> 00:27:04.440    in their communities willing to help.        304    00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.200    I met David Razu Aznar, graduating from the    Kennedy School today.        305    00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.620    David, stand up.        306    00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:18.770    He's a former city councilor who successfully    led the battle to make Mexico City the first        307    00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:30.870    Latin American city to pass marriage equality    -- even before San Francisco.        308    00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:33.530    This is my story too.        309    00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:41.640    A student in a dorm room, connecting one community    at a time, and keeping at it until one day        310    00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:46.360    we connect the whole world.        311    00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.470    Change starts local.        312    00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:54.370    Even global changes start small -- with people    like us.        313    00:27:54.370 --> 00:28:00.290    In our generation, the struggle of whether    we connect more, whether we achieve our biggest        314    00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:07.550    opportunities, comes down to this -- your    ability to build communities and create a        315    00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:22.330    world where every single person has a sense    of purpose.        316    00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:30.000    Class of 2017, you are graduating into a world    that needs purpose.        317    00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.690    It's up to you to create it.        318    00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:42.710    Now, you may be thinking: can I really do    this?        319    00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:47.679    Remember when I told you about that class    I taught at the Boys and Girls Club?        320    00:28:47.679 --> 00:28:53.460    One day after class I was talking to them    about college, and one of my top students        321    00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:59.400    raised his hand and said he wasn't sure he    could go because he's undocumented.        322    00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.220    He didn't know if they'd let him in.        323    00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:07.360    Last year I took him out to breakfast for    his birthday.        324    00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:13.200    I wanted to get him a present, so I asked    him and he started talking about students        325    00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:22.770    he saw struggling and said ""You know, I'd    really just like a book on social justice.""        326    00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:25.040    I was blown away.        327    00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:31.850    Here's a young guy who has every reason to    be cynical.        328    00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:39.440    He didn't know if the country he calls home    -- the only one he's known -- would deny him        329    00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:43.640    his dream of going to college.        330    00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.750    But he wasn't feeling sorry for himself.        331    00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:49.690    He wasn't even thinking of himself.        332    00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:58.360    He has a greater sense of purpose, and he's    going to bring people along with him.        333    00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.961    It says something about our current situation    that I can't even say his name because I don't        334    00:30:02.961 --> 00:30:07.070    want to put him at risk.        335    00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:13.250    But if a high school senior who doesn't know    what the future holds can do his part to move        336    00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:46.290    the world forward, then we owe it to the world    to do our part too.        337    00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:54.960    Before you walk out those gates one last time,    as we sit in front of Memorial Church, I am        338    00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:04.510    reminded of a prayer, Mi Shebeirach, that    I say whenever I face a challenge, that I        339    00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:09.429    sing to my daughter thinking about her future    when I tuck her into bed.        340    00:31:09.429 --> 00:31:15.429    It goes:    ""May the source of strength, who blessed the        341    00:31:15.429 --> 00:31:22.309    ones before us, help us *find the courage*    to make our lives a blessing.""        342    00:31:22.309 --> 00:31:29.780    I hope you find the courage to make your life    a blessing.        343    00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.720    Congratulations, Class of '17!        344    00:31:31.720 --> 00:32:18.220    Good luck out there.

is 93 years old        4    00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.200    she's still moving and grooving oh my        5    00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:34.710    goodness I hope I get those jeans now        6    00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.350    before I begin I would like to recognize        7    00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.770    that we are on the land of the Wampanoag        8    00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.470    nation that this is sacred earth and        9    00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.660    that we have a responsibility to care        10    00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.820    for it and to treat it as such        11    00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.110    [Applause]        12    00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.570    much to my annoyance growing up the        13    00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.079    phrase back in my day was used by my        14    00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.409    parents is often as infamous staples        15    00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.550    such as because I told you so and I'll        16    00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.840    give you something to cry about        17    00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.920    but as I stand on this stage childish        18    00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.490    irritation is replaced by immeasurable        19    00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.030    gratitude you see back in my father's        20    00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.140    day students who look like him like me        21    00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.850    were pushed out of schools like this        22    00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.850    before my mother even turned 16 white        23    00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.130    families around this country rioted        24    00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.240    against integration so these years at        25    00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.970    Harvard has been a vindication of their        26    00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.990    struggle and sacrifice but I have to say        27    00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.119    this place has a peculiar way of        28    00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.290    shifting that familial perspective now        29    00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.270    like many of us I came here wanting to        30    00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.030    meet my parents expectations and become        31    00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.610    successful so I internalized what has        32    00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.569    become a familiar routine I stressed        33    00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.790    over problem sets        34    00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.360    I worried about internships and jobs I        35    00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.840    shook hands I pass resumes and soon        36    00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.629    personal failures became unbearable soon        37    00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.989    when I would get rejections from student        38    00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.849    organizations I would feel worthless        39    00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.220    next to my friends would I would get a        40    00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.099    bad grade on a test I would worry about        41    00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.819    my future when I would be rejected from        42    00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.409    jobs and internships        43    00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.700    I burned how unfair this world was I        44    00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.000    forgot the lessons my parents had spent        45    00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.900    so many years trying to teach me so when        46    00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.870    I was at my lowest and I called out to        47    00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.930    my dad for help and guidance and he        48    00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.230    started to call off by saying back in my        49    00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:14.819    day I hung up we really do live in an        50    00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:21.359    unfair world of all the people who could        51    00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.389    have come here we are the select few who        52    00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.829    were chosen but as we worry about our        53    00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.470    personal failures here we will earn and        54    00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.319    achieve more than families whose only        55    00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.519    failure was living in a broken unequal        56    00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.449    system and we have been so conditioned        57    00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.049    by privilege and circumstance that        58    00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:46.620    exclusivity        59    00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.370    is only a crime when we don't receive        60    00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.979    its spoils our education here has not        61    00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:00.090    prepared us to understand our advantage        62    00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.560    position in the world or the        63    00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.780    authenticity of others pain in economics        64    00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.159    we learn to quantify and dehumanize        65    00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.840    suffering we learn that poverty        66    00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.000    inequality unemployment are unavoidable        67    00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.299    that so long as we reach equilibrium        68    00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.070    people who live on pennies a day are        69    00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.550    somehow better off        70    00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.110    in social studies and sociology we learn        71    00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.900    to treat other suffering as an academic        72    00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.699    exercise to ponder their pain from a        73    00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.650    distance we critique structural        74    00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.199    inequality and oppression but how many        75    00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.110    of us every day for the past four years        76    00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.659    have walked past people in the square        77    00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:52.449    experiencing homelessness and acted as        78    00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.060    though our theories and our conscience        79    00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.569    did not apply to them now I know we will        80    00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.710    be successful because we are ambitious        81    00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.280    and talented and personally driven and        82    00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.349    we will become leaders and innovators        83    00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.610    and founders of businesses and        84    00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.590    nonprofits but that is exactly why the        85    00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.460    change this world so desperately needs        86    00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.520    will not come from us that in spite of        87    00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.650    our jargon our let's grab a meals our        88    00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.860    votes for Hillary our votes for Jo        89    00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.500    we will never sacrifice our position our        90    00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.190    place in the system if we could give up        91    00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.470    this degree to prevent someone from        92    00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.140    experiencing homelessness or poverty or        93    00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.690    discrimination or violence we wouldn't        94    00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.670    and I know this because after four years        95    00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:04.100    here I didn't even consider it        96    00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.280    but last semester dining hall workers        97    00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.250    gave us the education that we so        98    00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.640    desperately needed for three weeks they        99    00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.220    went without pay they were on picket        100    00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.560    lines they marched they shared their        101    00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.740    stories and experiences they sacrificed        102    00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.290    everything for affordable health care        103    00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.630    and still we were skeptical and        104    00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.080    indifferent to their pain one student        105    00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.990    went so far as to tell me that        106    00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.060    unfortunately in the market we live in        107    00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.000    workers without college degrees simply        108    00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.880    could not be covered how quickly we have        109    00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.950    become the political leaders we claim to        110    00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:55.170    despise but dining hall workers remember        111    00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.480    the lesson that my parents taught me        112    00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.660    they remembered that our struggles are        113    00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.140    intimately connected they fought not        114    00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.090    only for affordable health care they        115    00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.280    fought for gender and racial equity they        116    00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.890    fought for undocumented workers they        117    00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.320    fought for their children for workers in        118    00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.630    other universities for workers around        119    00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.760    the world and they won this is where you        120    00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.060    class        121    00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:35.659    now as inspired as I am by that show of        122    00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:40.789    conviction I recognize that as we are        123    00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:43.309    now we are not yet ready to inherit this        124    00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:48.499    world it's a hard thing to say and it's        125    00:07:48.499 --> 00:07:49.879    a hard thing to hear        126    00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:55.699    and I am sure it would be easy to leave        127    00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:58.819    here feeling guilty but without any        128    00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:01.339    lasting commitment I'm sure it would be        129    00:08:01.339 --> 00:08:03.680    easy to convince ourselves that this is        130    00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.979    just the way the world works I am sure        131    00:08:06.979 --> 00:08:09.830    as my parents know all too well it would        132    00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.129    be easy for us to justify our privileges        133    00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:16.909    and unequal advantages by saying that        134    00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:19.520    it's better to take care of our own than        135    00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.639    to empower individuals who society has        136    00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:25.699    disowned but we have stepped on the        137    00:08:25.699 --> 00:08:28.159    blood and bones of people for far too        138    00:08:28.159 --> 00:08:31.189    long to forgive ourselves for doing what        139    00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:39.949    is easy now we need to act beyond        140    00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:43.639    ourselves and think about what is        141    00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:50.180    possible for others and I know if I do        142    00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.380    that then in the future when I hear my        143    00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.510    children complaining about the        144    00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.709    inconveniences        145    00:08:57.709 --> 00:09:01.519    in their world I will muster the        146    00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:05.870    strength to smile and I will know they        147    00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.240    are living in a world that is one I        148    00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.769    could only dream of because back in my        149    00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:14.829    day        150    00:09:28.329 --> 00:09:30.389    you

years old I learned        7    00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.200    suddenly that the world is a scary        8    00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.360    place on a beautiful crisp Blue Sky        9    00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.760    morning on my first day of first grade A        10    00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.520    cinematic Fireball roared out of the        11    00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.160    World Trade Center and fixed me to the        12    00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.320    living room        13    00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.239    window our apartment building shook like        14    00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.760    an earthquake then the lights went out        15    00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.879    the power outage ended Sesame Street        16    00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.000    early and with no elevator my mom and I        17    00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.880    ran down 22 flights of stairs to my        18    00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.560    building's        19    00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.240    lobby as the first Tower fell and the        20    00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.960    perfect Blue Sky turned black I floated        21    00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.920    away from the only home I had known in a        22    00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.240    Lifeboat going to New Jersey leaving        23    00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.360    behind my neighborhood buried in a Dusty        24    00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.840    white Avalanche of r rubble and        25    00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.600    debris when I got to New Jersey a        26    00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.920    fireman's deep voice directed me to jump        27    00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.640    I made it off the boat and onto the dock        28    00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.200    without falling into the Hudson River        29    00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.439    but I lost my shoes and watched        30    00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.680    helplessly as they drifted toward the        31    00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.399    Smoky        32    00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.520    Horizon while I stood there another        33    00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.439    firefighter took me by the hand and        34    00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.360    silently guided me through a hole in a        35    00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.520    chain link fence to an office building        36    00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.360    where my neighbor sought Refuge we        37    00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.280    looked like ghosts covered head to toe        38    00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.119    and        39    00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.480    debris the firefighter handed me a hose        40    00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.879    so I could clean my face and        41    00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.920    hands I know now that the firefighter        42    00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.360    had friends that had just died minutes        43    00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.599    before but in that selfless moment he        44    00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.560    took my hand and took the time to help        45    00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.400    me get cleaned up he showed me what it        46    00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.800    was like to be        47    00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.959    strong I've often wondered if in some        48    00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.440    small way I see the world the way I do        49    00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.519    today because of that        50    00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.840    firefighter because I witnessed that day        51    00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.599    that love and courage Trump haate and        52    00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.879    destruction while my neighborhood        53    00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.319    collapsed before my eyes my strongest        54    00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.000    memory is still of that one        55    00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.720    firefighter the story of 9/11 is that        56    00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.560    two planes hit the twi Twin Towers but        57    00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.360    the story for me is that a firefighter        58    00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.959    held my        59    00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.080    hand we the members of the class of        60    00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.280    2017 were first graders on September        61    00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.640    11th        62    00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.680    2001 we were high school seniors on        63    00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.120    April 15th 2013 when fresh off of        64    00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.400    receiving our acceptance letters to        65    00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.159    Harvard we would be suddenly sobered by        66    00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.159    the Boston Marathon bombing        67    00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.239    three people lost their lives many more        68    00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.560    were seriously injured 4 days later        69    00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.480    Cambridge was on lockdown as law        70    00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.799    enforcement searched for the remaining        71    00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.480    suspect students holed up in their dorm        72    00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.560    rooms as police cars patrolled the city        73    00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.040    visitas the 3-day event that would serve        74    00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.439    to welcome newly admitted students was        75    00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.560    to be hosted that weekend some of us had        76    00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.920    already arrived and spent the day at the        77    00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.159    airport in limbo waiting        78    00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:04.120    in the end visitas was        79    00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.959    cancelled however in the span of just a        80    00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.120    few hours Harvard's upper classmen        81    00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.480    rallied to create a virtual visitas and        82    00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.720    connected to us through our computer        83    00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.560    screens despite disruption and        84    00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.600    uncertainty Harvard students rallied to        85    00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.000    welcome the class of        86    00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.039    2017 the story of the 2013 Boston        87    00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.360    Marathon is that two brothers committed        88    00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.600    an act of Terror that killed and        89    00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.639    injured but what if the ultimate story        90    00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.360    was that bystanders ran toward the        91    00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.800    explosion to save        92    00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.320    lives the story of the days that        93    00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.240    followed is that Cambridge was on        94    00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.880    lockdown on the weekend that was        95    00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.800    supposed to have been our        96    00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.639    visitas but what if the ultimate story        97    00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.000    was that Harvard's upper classman cared        98    00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.960    enough to figure out another way to        99    00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.360    welcome us to Harvard and to make us        100    00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.759    feel at        101    00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.800    home graduation day is a celebration an        102    00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.520    occasion to lift a glass to make a toast        103    00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.400    to acknowledge accomplishments and to        104    00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.319    thank God we made it through        105    00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:22.080    exams but graduation day is also an        106    00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.919    opportunity for us to set an intention        107    00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.840    for ourselves that honors the        108    00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.120    responsibility that comes with the harv        109    00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.960    degree when the universe shifted on        110    00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.680    September 11th and again on April 15th        111    00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.600    people ran toward the        112    00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.280    explosion and when I look at a map and        113    00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.039    trace my finger up the coast all the        114    00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:48.400    lines and borders on the map run        115    00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.919    together and when we fall we always come        116    00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.039    down        117    00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:56.560    together in one        118    00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.479    piece I have learned that the world can        119    00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:01.400    be be a scary        120    00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.680    place but I have also learned that in        121    00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.759    the face of fear we have a        122    00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:12.479    choice who will we choose to be when we        123    00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:15.240    are presented with the opportunity to        124    00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.880    care about to stand with to speak up for        125    00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.080    to give up something of ourselves as a        126    00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.240    simple Act of        127    00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.120    humanity many of us have gone to bed in        128    00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.919    fear        129    00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:33.319    fear of discrimination fear of        130    00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:36.560    deportation fear of walls and band and        131    00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.520    roll        132    00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.120    backs we have been        133    00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.880    afraid but Among Us are the courageous I        134    00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.280    know because I've seen it I've eaten        135    00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.400    next to it in the dining hall I've        136    00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.639    studied across from it in the library        137    00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:53.639    I've walked by it in Harvard Yard I know        138    00:06:53.639 -->

00:07:45.630    idea that I come and accepted my son        136    00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.730    went to Yale Law School he didn't think        137    00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.780    it was such a big deal but but my son at        138    00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.850    Penn he didn't think either Harvard or        139    00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.470    Yale or Harvard were such a big deal but        140    00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.360    but when I've told my son and I mean it        141    00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.110    sincerely that the class invited me the        142    00:08:04.110

00:08:24.760    was more in tune with your generation to        150    00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:31.180    speak and so I understand I understand        151    00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.450    why I was

00:08:42.120    neither one of us have a Harvard degree        155    00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.430    and together we're worth approximately        156    00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.540    sixty two billion dollars so what the        157    00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:55.780    hell I mean I oh oh man I'm not even        158    00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.010    talking about Russia anyway look class

00:09:09.100    through gov 20 you made it through cs50        162    00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.130    which or whichever class kept you holed        163    00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:14.070    up in the library for days on end        164    00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.690    speaking of which is anyone aired out        165    00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:20.230    Lamont after finals week it's a lot of        166    00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.990    tension here you made it you made it        167    00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.940    through four years of Boston winters        168    00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:30.820    just in 2015 and you finally made it        169    00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.180    through the nine suspicions that your        170    00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.040    letter of acceptance must have been a        171    00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.720    mistake to realize that you really do        172    00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.160    you really do belong here unfortunately        173    00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.720    now for the rest of your life you're        174    00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.070    going to have to deal with the fact that        175    00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:52.090    every time you make some remotely stupid        176    00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.370    comment something's going to play pipe        177    00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:58.620    up and say great job Harvard        178    00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.110    but it's a cross I think you can bear        179    00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.910    classes 17 year graduating in the world        180    00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.209    of incredible change we're an awful lot        181    00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:11.009    of people are anxious and uncertain        182    00:10:11.009 --> 00:10:15.810    about their futures I know you know this        183    00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.660    feeling as well your Harvard tenure has        184    00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.420    been marked by people even before you        185    00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.959    arrived on campus you learned that your        186    00:10:23.959 --> 00:10:27.689    your visit us weekend was canceled        187    00:10:27.689 --> 00:10:29.629    because of the Boston Marathon bombing        188    00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:33.180    I'm sure that caused some anxiety for        189    00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.970    both you and your parents but then you        190    00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:41.100    saw how this great city responded how        191    00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.069    the people who Boston showed that        192    00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:47.639    America never gives up never gives in        193    00:10:47.639 --> 00:10:52.740    never been never ever bow and we own the        194    00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.410    finish line        195    00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:57.529    that's what Boston showed us all and        196    00:10:57.529 --> 00:11:00.540    then this past election cycle turned up        197    00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.970    some of the ugly realities that still        198    00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.559    remain in our country civilized        199    00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:07.559    discourse a real debate gave way so many        200    00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:11.100    times to the courses of rhetoric stoking        201    00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.579    the darkest emotions I thought we had        202    00:11:14.579 --> 00:11:16.620    passed the days when it was acceptable        203    00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.399    for politicians at all levels to bestow        204    00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:24.000    legitimacy on hate speech or friend        205    00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.480    fringe ideologies but the world was        206    00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.569    changing so rapidly but they're an awful        207    00:11:30.569 --> 00:11:32.519    lot of folks out there not just here in        208    00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:34.170    the United States but around the world        209    00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:38.269    who are both afraid of the change and        210    00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:41.579    susceptible to this kind of negative        211    00:11:41.579 --> 00:11:46.500    appeal globalization has cost some of        212    00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.079    them their livelihood digitization        213    00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:52.220    Moore's law artificial insemination        214    00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.990    intelligence are generating great        215    00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:58.050    anxiety in so many sectors of this        216    00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:02.160    country and the world some communities        217    00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.939    are literally struggling to get by and        218    00:12:04.939 --> 00:12:09.179    they're worried they're worried that        219    00:12:09.179 --> 00:12:11.459    they won't be able to keep up with this        220    00:12:11.459 --> 00:12:17.040    the change the scene and so we saw not        221    00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.189    for the first time in our history we saw        222    00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:23.399    how you play on the fears appeal to        223    00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:25.079    baser instincts rather than our better        224    00:12:25.079 --> 00:12:26.029    angels        225    00:12:26.029 --> 00:12:30.779    you can still reap some temporary but        226    00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:35.129    powerful political success we saw the        227    00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:38.220    forces of populism here and abroad seek        228    00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.769    to close our nation's gate against the        229    00:12:40.769 --> 00:12:43.879    challenges of a rapidly changing world        230    00:12:43.879 --> 00:12:47.790    to blame our troubles on the other the        231    00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.059    outsider the immigrant the minority to        232    00:12:51.059 --> 00:12:55.679    transgender anyone not like me became a        233    00:12:55.679 --> 00:13:00.569    scapegoat just fill the wall keep        234    00:13:00.569 --> 00:13:03.170    Muslims from coming to our country        235    00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.410    they're the reason I'm felling behind        236    00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:11.179    why I can't compete why I lost my job        237    00:13:11.179 --> 00:13:16.799    why I worry about my safety and I        238    00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:19.769    imagine for many of you seeing this        239    00:13:19.769 --> 00:13:23.490    unfold was incredibly disorienting and        240    00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.009    disheartening as was for so many        241    00:13:26.009 --> 00:13:30.569    Americans all across the country your        242    00:13:30.569 --> 00:13:34.889    action is understandable but I guarantee        243    00:13:34.889 --> 00:13:38.699    you I assure you this condition is        244    00:13:38.699 --> 00:13:41.819    temporary it's a temporary state of        245    00:13:41.819 --> 00:13:44.819    affairs the American people will not        246    00:13:44.819 --> 00:13:48.350    sustain this attitude        247    00:13:53.899 --> 00:13:56.699    the state the obvious no graduating        248    00:13:56.699 --> 00:13:58.620    class gets to choose the world in which        249    00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.290    they enter history has already been        250    00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.290    written for you by those of us who came        251    00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.589    before you but you're graduated in a        252    00:14:07.589 --> 00:14:09.930    moment of change and the people both        253    00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.199    here and abroad as one of my private my        254    00:14:13.199 --> 00:14:15.720    favorite poets Yeats wrote at Easter        255    00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.040    Sunday 1916 he wrote the words all        256    00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:24.019    changed changed utterly a terrible        257    00:14:24.019 --> 00:14:30.209    beauty is born I think that line more        258    00:14:30.209 --> 00:14:33.509    applies to the world today than it did        259    00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:38.100    88 is Ireland 100 years ago all has        260    00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:44.129    changed changed utterly but it's up to        261    00:14:44.129 --> 00:14:48.389    you the generation of this graduating        262    00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:53.689    class determined where such utter change        263    00:14:53.689 --> 00:14:57.629    will lead us you have a chance to        264    00:14:57.629 --> 00:15:01.250    actually help bend the arc of history        265    00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:05.100    closer to where you want as a nation you        266    00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.379    heard that phrase all the time you can        267    00:15:07.379 --> 00:15:10.680    bend the arc it only occurs the        268    00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.829    opportunity only occurs in moments of        269    00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:19.019    great change you must look at as an        270    00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:23.990    opportunity and sometimes perspective        271    00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:28.920    can be helpful I remember like your        272    00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.459    parents do sitting where you are for me        273    00:15:32.459 --> 00:15:38.879    it was June of 1968 as we begin our last        274    00:15:38.879 --> 00:15:42.569    semester we thought the war in Vietnam        275    00:15:42.569 --> 00:15:45.959    was going to be over in a matter of        276    00:15:45.959 --> 00:15:47.449    months        277    00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:51.749    but then the start of that semester        278    00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:54.629    the Vietcong launched the Tet Offensive        279    00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:57.209    in an effort to end the war in one        280    00:15:57.209 --> 00:16:01.259    single seismic assault two days into        281    00:16:01.259 --> 00:16:02.850    that offensive        282    00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.089    a bullet fired on the streets of Saigon        283    00:16:06.089 --> 00:16:09.149    by vietnam police

home to every one of my        291    00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.490    generation that there really was no end        292    00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:39.089    in sight there was no light at the end

00:18:56.190    nomination in California I remember        329    00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:58.070    looking around and member all of our        330    00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:06.900    classmates talking we thought how can        331    00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.350    this be happening        332    00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.510    name me a five-month period short of war        333    00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:22.560    has been as climactic as that but you        334    00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:29.670    know what in spite of everything most of        335    00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.940    us I never doubted for one instant that        336    00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:37.950    we could change history and I come from        337    00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.150    a technically lower class middle class        338    00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:46.650    household educated by two high school        339    00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:51.690    educated parents convinced me there        340    00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:55.020    wasn't a damn thing I couldn't do in        341    00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.720    this country couldn't do at my        342    00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:02.210    generation I was convinced could rewrite        343    00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:09.390    the outcome we were careening toward we        344    00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.330    knew it just because they murdered our        345    00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.750    heroes did not mean the dream did not        346    00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:18.540    live still very deep in our broken        347    00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:25.320    hearts we got involved we turned our        348    00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.940    anger and our disappointment in the        349    00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.970    resolve        350    00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.710    and I would respectfully argue over the        351    00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:37.019    next 10 years positive change just four        352    00:20:37.019 --> 00:20:39.240    years after I walked off the stage like        353    00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:43.710    you are as a kid with no money knowing        354    00:20:43.710 -->

00:21:48.269    Administration in saying that they had a        370    00:21:48.269 --> 00:21:52.500    plan to end the war in Vietnam you get        371    00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.000    to ask questions based on seniority        372    00:21:56.779 --> 00:21:58.769    everybody was very polite with the        373    00:21:58.769 --> 00:22:01.200    president asking generically about what        374    00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:06.149    the plan was I came my turn to ask my        375    00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:10.820    question and looked at President Ford        376    00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.009    determined but trying to be as polite as        377    00:22:14.009 --> 00:22:17.370    I could and I remember saying mr.        378    00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.929    president I'm sure if the president of        379    00:22:18.929 --> 00:22:20.759    my position the president would ask the        380    00:22:20.759 --> 00:22:24.480    president the following question mr.        381    00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.669    president you haven't told us any plan        382    00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:31.399    that was the first time on record        383    00:22:31.399 -->

00:25:39.140    nation that has always thought big not        437    00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.600    small I'm so tired of both political        438    00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.660    parties talking about incrementalism        439    00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.460    America has always thought big and        440    00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:54.710    boldly what has happened to us we're a        441    00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.250    nation        442    00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.400    from our founding imagination of        443    00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:09.500    optimists in order to fill your destiny        444    00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:14.590    class of 17 it's absolutely essential        445    00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:18.010    pre doing gauge in the world around you        446    00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:21.950    engage just like you did here on        447    00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.140    Harvard's campus I learned about your        448    00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:25.970    lying down in front of Memorial Chapel        449    00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.370    to insisted black lives matter        450    00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:30.560    seeing Harvard University dining service        451    00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.660    workers through their strike standing        452    00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:33.740    with them in a fight for better        453    00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.830    healthcare or joining the hundreds of        454    00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:39.440    thousands who came together to take part        455    00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.660    in a women's March or the science March        456    00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.750    or the climate March you've got to you        457    00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:48.080    must maintain that determination and        458    00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.600    commitment to making things better once        459    00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.100    you leave this campus because as I said        460    00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.350    you're the most engaged tolerant        461    00:26:54.350 --> 00:27:00.560    talented generation in our history but        462    00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.450    none of that will matter if you don't        463    00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:05.540    get engaged in the public affairs of        464    00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.090    this nation        465    00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:09.890    Harvard's onus to the politics my sister        466    00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:11.810    talked recently put out a study that        467    00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:14.420    said even though your generation is more        468    00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.000    aware of the tangible impact Public        469    00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.890    Security have my politics can have in        470    00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:21.830    your life fewer of you are interested in        471    00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:24.200    getting involved in public service only        472    00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:29.360    9% of your generation that's all if you        473    00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.280    break it down by gender it's even worse        474    00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.820    only 7% of women say they're thinking        475    00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.110    about a life in the public sector you        476    00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:41.290    just this week the Crimson reported that        477    00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:43.640    37% of your class who had been        478    00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.320    considering a job in the federal        479    00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.330    government changed your minds in the        480    00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:51.520    wake of last year's election forgive me        481    00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.720    but I think that's the wrong reaction        482    00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.430    you have an obligation to get engaged        483    00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:01.040    you have the capacity to make things        484    00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.190    change it's within your wheelhouse to do        485    00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.750    it        486    00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:11.700    and folks please for God's sake because        487    00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.669    by the way I know how you know the the        488    00:28:14.669 --> 00:28:18.270    image of people who see Harvard from the        489    00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.130    distance around the country think of you        490    00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.940    all as wealthy children of saikhan        491    00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.460    families a lot of you work like hell to        492    00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.320    get here a lot of you're here only        493    00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.870    because the school made up the        494    00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:32.399    difference between the tuition and what        495    00:28:32.399 --> 00:28:34.169    you can afford a lot of you are here        496    00:28:34.169 --> 00:28:36.360    because you worked like you've worked so        497    00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:43.010    hard to get here you deserve to be here        498    00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:46.529    so don't fool yourself into thinking now        499    00:28:46.529 --> 00:28:48.149    that you have this prestigious degree        500    00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:50.909    and it is a prestigious degree it will        501    00:28:50.909 --> 00:28:53.039    open doors for you that could not be        502    00:28:53.039 --> 00:28:57.570    opened otherwise I watched my son beau        503    00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:01.169    who graduated on from Penn he decided        504    00:29:01.169 --> 00:29:03.960    out a loyalty to go to Syracuse law        505    00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.429    school because his father did he could        506    00:29:05.429 --> 00:29:10.620    have gone other places he did well he        507

   521    00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:54.710    making not a joke        522    00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:58.230    well my capable son graduating Syracuse        523    00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:03.590    that

   526    00:30:10.279 --> 00:30:13.730    but don't kid yourself        527    00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:19.770    it will open doors for you that can't be        528    00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:23.039    opened by the vast majority of seniors        529    00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:25.860    graduating but with that comes an        530    00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:29.909    obligation and don't fool yourself into        531    00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:33.779    thinking that disengaging from the        532    00:30:33.779 --> 00:30:38.580    system that you think is broken will        533

affect        540    00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:05.039    you if our nation is permanently riddled        541    00:31:05.039 --> 00:31:08.399    with this much income inequality if        542    00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:10.049    we're unable to create good-paying        543    00:31:10.049 --> 00:31:12.000    middle-class jobs in the age of        544    00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.090    artificial intelligence and automation        545    00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:16.169    you'll not be able to thrive        546    00:31:16.169 --> 00:31:19.409    economically if your sister is the

you live in a        552    00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:35.899    circumstance not worthy of this country        553    00:31:35.899 --> 00:31:40.830    and the global rules that underwrite our        554    00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:43.549    security        555    00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:48.669    if the liberal state breaks down we'll        556    00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:52.090    all be less safe or less free the air we        557    00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:54.130    breathe is not clean the water not pure        558    00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:57.100    there is nowhere no matter how well

there's no gated community that can        562    00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:10.450    insulate you from your own failure to        563    00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:17.440    engage whichever path whichever path you        564    00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.770    take away from these Ivy's halls however        565    00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:23.650    you choose to engage or get involved one        566    00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:26.620    thing is certain each of you is going to        567    00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.289    have to navigate the traps in        568    00:32:28.289 --> 00:32:31.090    temptations the lie ahead as you enter        569    00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:34.539    the real world a little bit like what        570    00:32:34.539 --> 00:32:37.150    you talked about Dean there's an        571    00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:38.620    incredible amount of pressure in your        572    00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:42.880    generation to succeed you might notice        573    00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.880    that you start slipping into a bubble        574    00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:51.240    that validates certain choices that        575    00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.380    prioritizes the social trappings of        576    00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:55.720    success rather than really making a        577    00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.530    difference take this job live in this        578    00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.580    place hang out with people just like you        579    00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:06.669    take no real risk and have no real        580    00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:10.840    impact don't just accept what others        581    00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:14.559    view is the right choice for you instead        582    00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:19.260    choose what you feel is the right choice        583    00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:25.480    based on what's important to you my dad        584    00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.690    used to have an expression a Joey

--> 00:33:34.450    knows that they're about to do and        588    00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:39.039    thinks it still matters I'll bet if you        589    00:33:39.039 --> 00:33:42.039    look around

   592    00:33:46.179 --> 00:33:50.640    whether what they do still matters        593    00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.070    there's no silver bullet no reductive        594    00:33:54.070 -->

     599    00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.409    career I've met every major world leader        600    00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:12.440    in the last 42 years because of the        601    00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:16.220    nature of my job I've made some basic        602    00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:19.909    observations about those who managed to        603    00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:24.440    find success

      609    00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:41.480    it's about being engaged it's about        610    00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.889    being there for a friend or a colleague        611    00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:46.159    when they're injured in an accident it's        612    00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:47.480    about little things like remember to        613    00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.460    congratulate them on a marriage or the        614    00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:53.290    birth of a child or graduation        615    00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:56.599    it's about being available as they're        616    00:34:56.599 --> 00:34:58.430    going through some serious personal loss        617    00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:03.820    or failure it's about being personal        618    00:35:04.359 --> 00:35:09.200    resist the temptation to let Network be        619    00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:14.810    a verb that saps the personal way that        620    00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:16.730    blinds you to the person right in front        621    00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:18.230    of you their hopes their fears their        622    00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:22.339    burdens resist the temptation to ascribe        623    00:35:22.339 --> 00:35:24.920    motive to someone's action because you        624    00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.890    really don't know their motive        625    00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:30.740    it only gets in the way of ever reaching        626    00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:33.950    the consensus or making progress build        627    00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:36.320    real relations even with people with        628    00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.550    whom you vehemently disagree you'll not        629    00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.250    only be happier I guarantee you you'll        630    00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:46.760    be more successful the second thing is        631    00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.130    remember that although note is better        632    00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:50.200    than you        633    00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.339    everyone's your equal deserves to be        634    00:35:52.339 --> 00:35:55.580    treated with dignity and respect I've        635    00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.349    worked with eight presidents hundreds of        636    00:35:57.349 --> 00:36:01.220    senators that most leaders as I said had        637    00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.500    scores of talented people from every        638    00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.210    great institution in this country and        639    00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:08.240    abroad work for me here's what I        640    00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.609    observed        641    00:36:09.609 --> 00:36:11.869    regardless of their academic or social        642    00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:15.619    backgrounds those who had the most        643    00:36:15.619 --> 00:36:18.200    success and were most respective and        644    00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.019    therefore got the most done or the ones        645    00:36:21.019 --> 00:36:23.839    who never confused academic credentials        646    00:36:23.839 --> 00:36:27.140    or social sophistication with gravitas        647    00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:37.700    or judgment you and your parents know        648    00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.829    some really brilliant people who are        649    00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:44.930    really stupid no I'm serious I mean        650    00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:49.940    deadly earnest and don't forget the        651    00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:53.289    things that don't come with this degree        652    00:36:53.289 --> 00:36:55.400    what doesn't come with this degree is        653    00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.650    the heart to distinguish between what's        654    00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:01.460    meaningful and was fleeting and they had        655    00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.410    to know the difference between knowledge        656    00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:07.039    and judgment remember the neighborhood        657    00:37:07.039 --> 00:37:09.279    you came from        658    00:37:09.279 --> 00:37:11.450    remember those it doesn't have the same        659    00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:13.549    chance you had or the same ability you        660    00:37:13.549 --> 00:37:17.420    have their instincts their dignity        661    00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.339    remember they are still capable doing        662    00:37:19.339 --> 00:37:22.039    extraordinary things as well if given        663    00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:28.099    half a chance and finally never forget        664    00:37:28.099 --> 00:37:32.140    that reality has a way of intruding        665    00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:34.579    tomorrow you'll receive this incredibly        666    00:37:34.579 --> 00:37:36.829    prestigious degree as I said you earned        667    00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:39.559    it you deserve it and all that goes with        668    00:37:39.559 --> 00:37:42.890    it and I have no doubt that each of you        669    00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:46.279    is going to be very very successful and        670    00:37:46.279 --> 00:37:48.950    personal ambition is important it's an        671    00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:51.470    incredible motivator no one has ever        672    00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:55.339    accused me of being unambitious but        673    00:37:55.339 --> 00:38:00.819    ambition without perspective is a killer        674    00:38:00.819 --> 00:38:08.690    when reality intrudes it will intrude as        675    00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:11.049    I said I got elected I was 29 years old        676    00:38:11.049 --> 00:38:13.819    the second youngest man mr.

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:53.570    broadsided them come home reality        687    00:38:53.570 --> 00:39:00.080    intrudes because I had an incredibly        688    00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.980    good fortune of an extended family        689    00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.480    grounded in love and loyalty and a sense        690    00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:09.110    of obligation they imparted to me not        691    00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:13.610    only got help by folks into my sons they        692    00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:14.780    were my redemption        693    00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:19.670    I began commuting every single day and        694    00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:23.000    you did it for 37 years 259 miles a day        695    00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.420    from Washington to Wilmington Wilmington        696    00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:29.510    to Washington no no it's not about me        697    00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:31.370    thank you you're very generous but not        698    00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:36.310    about me I needed to be I needed then        699    00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.810    because I learned with all your parents        700    00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:43.220    no a child can hold an important thought        701    00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.370    for his mother or father 12 maybe 24        702    00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:53.030    hours but if you miss it it's gone it's        703    00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:55.150    gone        704    00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:02.090    and so that's one ovary night laying bed        705    00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:03.590    with them and got up in the morning with        706    00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:06.500    no Ozzie and Harriet breakfast or        707    00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.000    anything like that was just a chance to        708    00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.580    talk you're going to face your own        709    00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.200    crises your parents and face worst        710    00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.570    crisis many of you have already faced        711    00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:18.710    worst crisis the truth is you all go        712    00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:20.120    through something difficult        713    00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:22.490    you'll wrestle with the kinds of choices        714    00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:25.490    every day and as you do it helps a great        715    00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:29.030    deal if you resist the temptation to        716    00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:34.880    rationalize I know it's her birthday but        717    00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.200    it really doesn't matter that much to        718    00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.690    her and this business opportunity is so        719    00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:42.560    important it will mean so much to all of        720    00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.680    us if I just if I just leave and make        721    00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:49.730    that appointment I know this may be his        722    00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:53.240    last game but in order to make it off to        723    00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.700    take the red-eye back and then I got to        724    00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.560    get in the morning and fly the next day        725    00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:00.320    back again he'll understand        726    00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:04.910    I know we've been planning this vacation        727    00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:08.900    the family for a long time but there'll        728    00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:10.700    be other times because it's just too        729    00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:19.220    much of an opportunity for me here it        730    00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.220    matters        731    00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:26.840    it matters it's possible we both have        732    00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:30.140    been successful and it's possible to        733    00:41:30.140 -->

rationalize I'm so very        736    00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:47.690    optimistic about your generation I know        737    00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:49.310    you're going to rise the me tries to        738    00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:51.730    meet these challenges with the same        739    00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:54.140    irrepressible irreducible American        740    00:41:54.140 -->

grappling with the        743    00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.760    deep-rooted cankers of injustice and        744    00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.740    inequity that have always challenged our        745    00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:10.580    quest for more perfect union we're also        746    00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.140    facing new challenge that's going to        747    00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:13.730    require your generation to break the        748    00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:16.570    ground climate change cyber rules norms        749    00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:20.180    thready

752    00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:28.460    define our place in the world class of        753    00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.490    17 you're stepping into the generation        754    00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:32.870    where is now your turn and make no        755    00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:37.340    mistake about it the United States is so        756    00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:41.120    much better positioned than any country        757    00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:45.350    in the world to lead the world I want        758    00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:47.150    the class if they think of nothing that        759    00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:53.120    I said but this ladies and gentlemen I        760    00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:58.040    am so sick and tired of this attitude as        761    00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:04.330    woe is me we have such enormous problem        762    00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:06.230    ladies and gentlemen were better        763    00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:09.370    positioned than any nation in the world        764    00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:12.980    I've not met a single world leader who        765    00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.560    wouldn't trade places and problems with        766    00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.830    us in a heartbeat I spent more time with        767    00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:21.580    President Xi than any world leader has        768    00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:26.380    25 hours of private dinners with them        769    00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:30.020    they not only don't have energy didn't        770    00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.750    have enough water        771    00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:36.400    water 30% of the arable land is polluted        772    00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:41.160    with cadmium they got to find 9,500,000        773    00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:47.820    urban jobs a year I want them to succeed        774    00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.650    but the idea China is going to eat our        775    00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:57.580    lunch give me a break in the late 90s I        776    00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:59.290    debated the Heritage Foundation at the        777    00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:01.630    Wharton School when Japan was going to        778    00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:07.210    own America come on for God's sake no no        779    00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:09.520    they're good countries we want them to        780    00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:13.300    succeed but I want you understand what        781    00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:18.130    you're about to inherit it's incredible        782    00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:21.430    what we can do we have the most        783    00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:23.040    productive workers in the world        784    00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.540    objectively three times as productive as        785    00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.790    they are in Asia we're the most agile        786    00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:29.760    venture capitalist system in the world        787    00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.780    we have the greatest research        788    00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:33.340    universities of the world there's more        789    00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:35.260    great research universities in United        790    00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.810    States America than the entire rest of        791    00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:41.560    the world combined it because of Dwight        792    00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.950    Eisenhower we're the epicenter of energy        793    00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:46.570    production will remain so through this        794    00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:55.930    century what are we looking down for so        795    00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:59.680    it's time it's time for mercury to get        796    00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:03.400    up it's time for us once again to regain        797    00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.050    our sense of unity and purpose and        798    00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:08.770    remember who in God's name we are with        799    00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:10.839    all the brainpower and energy sitting in        800    00:45:10.839 --> 00:45:16.210    front of me I know I know that nothing        801    00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:20.859    and no one no one can keep us from        802    00:45:20.859 --> 00:45:22.390    meeting our goals it's time for your        803    00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:26.200    generation your entire generation to        804    00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.690    remember the admonition of my philosophy        805    00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:31.630    professor I remember leaving his name        806    00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:34.869    was dr. Ingersoll and as if I was        807    00:45:34.869 --> 00:45:36.250    supposed to know he said remember what        808    00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:38.050    Plato said Joe everything what in the        809    00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:40.530    hell's that about        810    00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.540    Plato said dependently good people pay        811    00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.580    for not being involved in politics is        812    00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:49.730    being governed by people worse than        813    00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:52.420    themselves let me say that again the        814    00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:56.150    penalty good people pay for not being        815    00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:58.370    involved with politics is being governed        816    00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:00.620    by people worse than themselves so you        817    00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:03.440    have to engage you have to be involved        818    00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:06.580    even in this dirty business of politics        819    00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:12.040    you have to for your own safety sake and        820    00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:15.950    I have no doubt you will because you        821    00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:18.740    must thank you for having me god bless        822    00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:22.000    you all and may God protect our        823    00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:47.410    you        "

My remarks at this moment        2    00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.310    in our commencement rituals are        3    00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.990    officially titled        4    00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.740    ""A report to the alumni."" The first time I        5    00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.460    delivered them in 2008 I was the only        6    00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.460    obstacle between all of you and JK        7    00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.470    Rowling. I looked out on a sea of eager        8    00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.260    children, costumed Dumbledores, and        9    00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.710    Quidditch brooms waving impatiently in        10    00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.900    the air. Today you await Mark Zuckerberg        11    00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.590    whose wizardry takes a different form        12    00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.160    one that has changed the world and        13    00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.540    although he doesn't seem to have        14    00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.540    inspired an outbreak of hoodies, we        15    00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.270    certainly do have some costumes in this        16    00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.850    audience today; I see we're now handing        17    00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.670    out blankets. This is a day of joy and        18    00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.509    celebration of happy endings and new        19    00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.369    beginnings, of families and friends, of        20    00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.969    achievements and hopes, it is also a day        21    00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.209    when we as a university perform our most        22    00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:29.200    important annual ritual, affirming once        23    00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.609    again the purposes that animate us and        24    00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:37.380    the values that direct and inspire us. I        25    00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.240    want to speak today about one of the        26    00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.999    most important and, in recent months, most        27    00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:47.499    contested of these values. It is one that        28    00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:50.249    has provoked debate, dissent,        29    00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:53.380    confrontation, and even violence on        30    00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.099    campuses across the country, and one that        31    00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:59.319    has attracted widespread public        32    00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.789    attention and criticism. I am of course        33    00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.500    talking about issues of free speech on        34    00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.439    university campuses. The meaning and        35    00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.720    limits of free        36    00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.820    speech are questions deeply embedded in        37    00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:20.000    our legal system. In interpretations of        38    00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.469    the First Amendment and its        39    00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:25.370    applications. I am no constitutional        40    00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.849    lawyer,        41    00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.569    indeed no lawyer at all, and I do not        42    00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.849    intend in my brief remarks today to        43    00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.629    address complex legal doctrines; nor        44    00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.170    clearly can I, in a few brief minutes,        45    00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.260    take on even a fraction of the arguments        46    00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.400    that have been advanced on this issue.        47    00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.950    Instead I speak as one who has been a        48    00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.669    university president for a decade in        49    00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:56.510    order to raise three questions: first,        50    00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.469    why is free speech so important to and        51    00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:05.959    at universities? Second, why does it seem        52    00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.609    under special challenge right now? And        53    00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.579    third, how might we better address these        54    00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.000    challenges by moving beyond just        55    00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.150    defensively protecting free speech which,        56    00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.400    of course, we must do, to actively and        57    00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.489    affirmatively enabling it and nurturing        58    00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.419    environments in which it can thrive? So        59    00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:36.199    first why is free speech so important to        60    00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:40.220    and at universities? This is a question I        61    00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.689    took up with the newly arrived        62    00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.150    first-year students in the college when        63    00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.699    I welcomed them at convocation last fall.        64    00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:50.329    For centuries I told them universities        65    00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.979    have been environments in which        66    00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:55.329    knowledge has been discovered, collected        67    00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.150    studied, debated, expanded, changed, and        68    00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.509    advanced through the power of rational        69    00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:07.269    argument and exchange. We pursued truth        70    00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.080    unrelentingly but we must never be so        71    00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.640    complacent as to believe we have unerringly        72    00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.120    attained it. Veritas is        73    00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.580    inspiration and aspiration. We assume        74    00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.370    there is always more to know and        75    00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.300    discover,        76    00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.720    so we open ourselves to challenge and        77    00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.100    change. We must always be ready to be        78    00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.400    wrong. So being part of a university        79    00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.470    community requires courage and humility.        80    00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.720    Universities must be places open to the        81    00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.010    kind of debate that can change ideas, and        82    00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.870    committed to standards of reason and        83    00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.560    evidence that form the basis for        84    00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.280    evaluating them. Silencing ideas or        85    00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.370    basking in intellectual orthodoxy        86    00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.540    independent of facts and evidence        87    00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.669    impedes our access to new and better        88    00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.510    ideas, and it inhibits a full and        89    00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.950    considered rejection of bad ones. From at        90    00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.890    least the time of Galileo we can see how        91    00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.850    repressing seemingly heretical ideas has        92    00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.220    blinded societies and nations        93    00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.639    to enhance knowledge and understanding        94    00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.360    on which progress depends. Far more        95    00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.600    recently we can see here at Harvard how        96    00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.310    our inattentiveness        97    00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.550    to the power and appeal of conservative        98    00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.400    voices left much of our community        99    00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.090    astonished, blindsided by the outcome of        100    00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.350    last fall's election. We must work to        101    00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.260    ensure that universities do not become        102    00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.130    bubbles isolated from the concerns and        103    00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.440    discourse of the society that surrounds        104    00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.190    them. Universities must model a        105    00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.440    commitment to the notion that truth        106    00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.000    cannot simply be claimed, but must be        107    00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.550    established. Established through reasoned        108    00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.030    argument, assessment, and even sometimes        109    00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.789    uncomfortable challenges that provide        110    00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:23.390    the foundation for truth. The legitimacy        111    00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.660    of universities claim to be sources        112    00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.039    and validators of fact depends on our        113    00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.729    willingness to actively and vigorously defend        114    00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:38.390    those facts. And we must remember that        115    00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.260    limiting        116    00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.530    some speech opens the dangerous        117    00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.260    possibility that the speech that is        118    00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.480    ultimately censored may be our own. If        119    00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.310    some words are to be treated as        120    00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.210    equivalent to physical violence, and        121    00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.510    silenced or even prosecuted, who is to        122    00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:04.190    decide which words? Freedom of expression        123    00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.920    as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes        124    00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.820    famously said long ago, protects free        125    00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.180    thought for those who agree with us, but        126    00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.220    excuse me, not only free thought        127    00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.190    for those who agree with us, but freedom        128    00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.390    for the thought we hate. We need to hear        129    00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.420    those hateful ideas so our society is        130    00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.550    fully equipped to oppose and defeat them.        131    00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.120    Over the years,        132    00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.490    differences about the implementation of        133    00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.680    the university's free speech principles        134    00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.030    have often provoked controversy and we        135    00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.880    haven't always gotten it right. As long        136    00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.170    ago as 1939, an invitation from a student        137    00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.630    group to the head of the American        138    00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.890    Communist Party generated protests, and        139    00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.570    the invitation was ultimately cancelled        140    00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.350    by the corporation. Bertrand Russell's        141    00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.720    appointment as William James lecturer        142    00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.030    just a year later divided the        143    00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.150    corporation, but president Conan broke        144    00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.930    the tie and Russell came. Campus        145    00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.630    conflicts over invited speakers are        146    00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.710    hardly new, yet the vehements with which        147    00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.020    these issues have been debated in recent        148    00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.140    months, not just on campuses but in the        149    00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.230    broader public sphere, suggest there is        150    00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.520    something distinctive about this moment.        151    00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.800    Certainly these controversies reflect a        152    00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.790    highly polarized political and social        153    00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:40.070    environment, perhaps the most divisive        154    00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:44.120    since the era of the civil war. And in        155    00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.810    these already fractious circumstances,        156    00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.000    free speech debates have provided a        157    00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.130    fertile substrate        158    00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.560    into which anger and disagreement could        159    00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.680    be planted to nourish partisan outrage        160    00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.550    and generate media clickbait. But that        161    00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:05.410    is only a partial explanation.        162    00:09:05.589 --> 00:09:08.089    Universities themselves have changed        163    00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:11.180    dramatically in recent years, reaching        164    00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.190    beyond their traditional largely        165    00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.759    homogeneous populations to become more        166    00:09:16.759 --> 00:09:19.089    diverse than perhaps any other        167    00:09:19.089 --> 00:09:22.130    institution in which Americans find        168    00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.180    themselves living together. Once        169    00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:29.089    overwhelmingly white, male, Protestant, and        170    00:09:29.089 --> 00:09:33.139    upper-class, Harvard College is now half        171    00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:37.100    female, majority minority, religiously        172    00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.940    pluralistic with nearly 60% of students        173    00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.790    able to attend because of financial aid.        174    00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.959    Fifteen percent are the first in their        175    00:09:56.959 --> 00:10:05.209    families to go to college. Many of        176    00:10:05.209 --> 00:10:07.730    our students struggle to feel full        177    00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.390    members of this community: a community in        178    00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.360    which people like them have so recently        179    00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.829    arrived. They seek evidence and assurance        180    00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:21.890    that to borrow the title of a powerful        181    00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.709    theatrical piece created by a group of        182    00:10:24.709 --> 00:10:27.769    our African-American students, evidence        183    00:10:27.769 --> 00:10:31.810    and assurance that they too are Harvard.        184    00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:35.390    The price of our commitment to freedom        185    00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:39.290    of speech is paid disproportionately by        186    00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.519    these students. For them free speech has        187    00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:46.760    not infrequently included enduring a        188    00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.490    questioning of their abilities, their        189    00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.180    humanity, their morality, their very        190    00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.200    legitimacy here. Our values and our        191    00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.390    theory of education rest on the        192    00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.459    assumption that members of our community        193    00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:04.250    will take the risk of speaking and will        194    00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.100    actively compete in our wild rumpus of        195    00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.880    argument and ideas. It requires them as        196    00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.120    well to be fearless in face of argument        197    00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.560    or challenge or even verbal insult and        198    00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.800    it expects that fearlessness even when        199    00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.350    the challenge is directed to the very        200    00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:28.570    identity, race, religion, gender, ethnicity,        201    00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:32.779    sexual orientation, nationality, that may        202    00:11:32.779 --> 00:11:35.240    have made them uncertain about their        203    00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.440    right to be here in the first place.        204    00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.920    Demonstrating such fearlessness is hard.        205    00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.959    No one should be mocked as a snowflake        206    00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:50.380    for finding it so. Hard,        207    00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:58.889    hard but important and attainable.        208    00:11:58.889 --> 00:12:01.629    Attainable, we believe, for every member        209    00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:05.319    of our community. But the price of free        210    00:12:05.319 --> 00:12:08.230    speech cannot be charged just to those        211    00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.819    most likely to become its target. We must        212    00:12:12.819 --> 00:12:15.850    support and empower the voices of all        213    00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.179    the members of our community and nurture        214    00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:22.059    the courage and humility that our        215    00:12:22.059 --> 00:12:24.699    commitment to unfettered debate demands        216    00:12:24.699 --> 00:12:27.759    from all of us. And that courage means        217    00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:31.209    not only resilience in face of challenge        218    00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:34.720    or attack, but strength to speak out        219    00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.410    against injustices directed at others        220    00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.910    as well. Free speech does not just happen        221    00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.759    and require intervention when it is        222    00:12:45.759 --> 00:12:49.420    impeded. It is not about the freedom to        223    00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.910    out-shout others while everyone has        224    00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:55.629    their fingers in their ears. For free        225    00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:57.819    speech to flourish, we must build an        226    00:12:57.819 --> 00:12:59.769    environment where everyone takes        227    00:12:59.769 --> 00:13:02.860    responsibility for the right not just to        228    00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.269    speak, but to hear and be heard,        229    00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:08.860    where everyone assumes the        230    00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.170    responsibility to treat others with        231    00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.829    dignity and respect. It requires not just        232    00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:17.740    speakers, but in the words of James Ryan,        233    00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.519    Dean of our Graduate School of Education,        234    00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:24.429    generous listeners. Amidst the current        235    00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:27.249    soul-searching about free speech, we need        236    00:13:27.249 --> 00:13:30.369    to devote more attention to establishing        237    00:13:30.369 --> 00:13:32.649    the conditions in which everyone's        238    00:13:32.649 --> 00:13:36.990    speech is encouraged and taken seriously.        239    00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.029    Ensuring freedom of speech is not just        240    00:13:40.029 --> 00:13:43.269    about allowing speech; it is about        241    00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:45.790    actively creating a community where        242    00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.720    everyone can contribute and flourish; a        243    00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.939    community where argument is relished, not        244    00:13:51.939 --> 00:13:55.149    feared. Freedom of speech is not just        245    00:13:55.149 --> 00:13:59.069    freedom from censorship, it is freedom to        246    00:13:59.069 --> 00:14:02.350    actively join the debate as a full        247    00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.300    participant.        248    00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.699    It is about creating a context in which        249    00:14:06.699 --> 00:14:10.959    genuine debate can happen. Talk a lot I        250    00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:14.829    urged the class of 2020 last fall; listen        251    00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:15.519    more.        252    00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:19.089    Don't stand safely on the sidelines; take        253    00:14:19.089 --> 00:14:21.970    the risk of being wrong: it is the best        254    00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.329    way to learn and grow. And build a        255    00:14:25.329 --> 00:14:28.089    culture of generous listening so that        256    00:14:28.089 --> 00:14:31.120    others may be emboldened to take risks        257    00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.110    too. A community in a shared search for        258    00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:38.319    Veritas: that is the ideal for which        259    00:14:38.319 --> 00:14:42.129    Harvard must strive. We need it now more        260    00:14:42.129 --> 00:14:46.290    than ever. Thank you.        "

to stay warm        4    00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.920    around the circle set several        5    00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.859    bright-eyed incoming freshmen including        6    00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.369    myself we shivered slightly in the        7    00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.099    evening chill and I pulled my jacket        8    00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.670    tighter above us a canopy of stars        9    00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.739    emerged from the darkness we were asked        10    00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.640    to tell a story about ourselves I had        11    00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.539    only known these people for 48 hours but        12    00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.329    excited nervous and willing to go        13    00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.559    wherever we were pointed we went ahead I        14    00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.359    told the story of my family and our        15    00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.280    journey settling into North America as        16    00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.600    immigrants as I spoke everyone stayed        17    00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.710    silent after I finished the only sound        18    00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.660    with the flowing stream and crackling        19    00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.050    fire I briefly wondered if I was a        20    00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.240    terrible storyteller and everyone had        21    00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.350    fallen asleep but in this very silence I        22    00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.140    felt an inexplicable sense of connection        23    00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.690    with my peers who moments ago were        24    00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.220    strangers if you had told me that my        25    00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.290    introduction to Harvard involved body        26    00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.780    odor built up over five days without a        27    00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.930    shower I may have gone to Yale        28    00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.950    but today four years later this moment        29    00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.539    is one of the most formative of my        30    00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.780    college experience it wasn't just the        31    00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.030    warmth of the fire the scenery it        32    00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.399    illuminated or the excitement of        33    00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.700    starting the next phase of our lives it        34    00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.130    was because of the silence as I spoke        35    00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.289    everyone simply listened their        36    00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.350    motivation was not to comment respond or        37    00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.799    a few CH to truly hear what I had to say        38    00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.920    our society values the outspoken the        39    00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.959    opinionated        40    00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.299    there are debate tournaments but who's        41    00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.480    ever heard of a listening tournament        42    00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.310    especially at Harvard where we are        43    00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.769    constantly asked to speak our minds and        44    00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.930    prove ourselves silence is devalued but        45    00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.569    as we focus on talking we miss an        46    00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.209    opportunity to grasp the complexity        47    00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.900    around us instead when we let silence        48    00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.319    wash over a space is created for        49    00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.870    vulnerability and the potential to know        50    00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.639    others in a way that all our talking        51    00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.930    could never allow to hear the person who        52    00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.609    is brave enough to share in moments of        53    00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.410    struggle when everyone else seems to        54    00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.889    have it together the peer who feels like        55    00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:08.220    an outsider the friend who has secretly        56    00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.139    endured an experience that has shaped        57    00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:15.180    all our interactions silence allows us        58    00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.940    to engage with each other more deeply it        59    00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.769    has shown me during my time at Harvard        60    00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.440    with all of you that the person sitting        61    00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.849    two rows in front of me        62    00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.669    has a story as complex rich and        63    00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:32.280    confusing as my own in the piece of        64    00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.010    reflections we can also engage more        65    00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.120    genuinely with ourselves to pause from        66    00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.560    the programmed noise and rush of the        67    00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.329    everyday and to just be sometimes        68    00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.669    instead of books filled with texts we        69    00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.820    simply need to open one with blank pages        70    00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.150    onto which our own thoughts musings        71    00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.860    reflections can pour out that night as        72    00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.310    the flame flickered low I learned that        73    00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.099    what made others feel most understood        74    00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.920    what makes me feel most understood is an        75    00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.780    appreciation for the mundane the stories        76    00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.340    we find ourselves sharing around the        77    00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.639    fire are not the contents of our resumes        78    00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:19.340    they are about our families about a walk        79    00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.289    we took along the Charles River with a        80    00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.470    friend about a call we got from a parent        81    00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.820    sibling or child to check in it is these        82    00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.570    hidden moments the seemingly forgettable        83    00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.240    substance of our daily lives that make        84    00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.280    up the very core of who we are        85    00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.680    dear class of 2017        86    00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.889    tomorrow we graduate and we leave behind        87    00:04:45.889 -->

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.750    enter the next phase of our lives not        93    00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.270    only with our talk and opinions but also        94    00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.960    our silence to honor and listen to the        95    00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.510    complexities around us and in ourselves        96    00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.310    whatever they may be four years ago one        97    00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.349    of the most powerful welcomes I received        98    00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.360    at Harvard was in the quiet of nature as        99    00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.389    the stream trickled by and the embers        100    00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:29.050    continued to blow        101    00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.940    we are not gathered around a fire today        102    00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.250    but I'd like to practice what I preach        103    00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.159    and take the last valuable moments of my        104    00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:40.550    speech not speaking with you but instead        105    00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.039    spending the next 10 seconds with you in        106    00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.400    silence reflecting and listening to this        107    00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.590    unique place we have all shared these        108    00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.190    last four years        109    00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.380    thank you        110    00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:16.199    [Applause]

00:00:19.990    harboring some slight resentment over        4    00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.910    the unrealistic expectations that we set        5    00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.800    for you welcome to Harvard class de 2017        6    00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.800    to quote the Honorable Vice President        7    00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.330    Joe Biden seated behind me here today        8

failure and success the ceaseless        11    00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.340    prism through which we all view our        12    00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.500    lives and increasingly over the past        13    00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.200    year the method in which my classes have        14    00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.680    been graded but Declan you may be        15    00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.979    wondering how can you possibly talk to        16    00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.540    us about failure you're so talented and        17    00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.780    handsome and to that I would say to you        18    00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.930    please sit down mom you're interrupting        19    00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.210    my big speech we talked about this        20    00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.920    seriously though I failed a lot on this        21    00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.460    campus and so have all of you except for        22    00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.910    my good friend Daniel he's PBK and his        23    00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.890    diploma tomorrow is going to have the        24    00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:45.640    word suma        25    00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.960    or mine we'll just say so Matt that was        26    00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.040    my big Latin pronunciation joke we        27    00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.659    failed to take our first final exams        28    00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.070    without being interrupted by bomb        29    00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.229    threats and we failed to avoid throwing        30    00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.420    up in the elevator at freshmen formal so        31    00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.760    much that Harvard is not allowed to hold        32    00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.540    events there anymore I myself even        33    00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.200    failed a statistics midterm once        34    00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.160    actually failed probably is not the        35    00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.510    right word there I got an 11% but thanks        36    00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.190    to Harvard's great inflation I still        37    00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.690    ended up with an A I I didn't I got a C+        38    00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.920    but my friends here today would not        39    00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.180    believe this but in high school my        40    00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.760    parents actually begged me to get a B so        41    00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.739    that I could experience a setback and        42    00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.610    learn to cope with imperfection mom dad        43    00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.590    these past four years were for you        44    00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.620    my second biggest failure        45    00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.980    besides that stat 110 hiccup was letting        46    00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.560    Donald Trump become president sorry        47    00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.090    about that        48    00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.849    I should explain I last fall        49    00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.420    I held undoubtedly the most impressive        50    00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.400    and influential political position of        51    00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:10.049    anybody on this page today I was I was        52    00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.849    president of the Harvard Republican Club        53    00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.530    hold your applause please thank you I        54    00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.390    will say though as a history major we've        55    00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.790    left the office of the vice presidency        56    00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.579    vacant a combined 38 years since our        57    00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.650    nation's founding Harvard Republican        58    00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.730    Club presidency never unoccupied which        59    00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.459    one's more important oh no I'm not a        60    00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.829    conspiracy theory guy but I am a        61    00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.670    connect-the-dots guy        62    00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.400    but speaking of conspiracy theory guys        63    00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.639    Donald Trump during the campaign I wrote        64    00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.190    an op-ed some tweets and several        65    00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.430    strongly worded facebook statuses saying        66    00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.590    maybe just maybe he wouldn't be the best        67    00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.769    president now luckily I was way off base        68    00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.030    he's doing so well so well but at the        69    00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.340    time that was an incredibly brave thing        70    00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.329    for me to do our president is very very        71    00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.040    popular amongst the student body here        72    00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.380    but even after I really stuck my head        73    00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.770    out amongst my peers Donald Trump is at        74    00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.740    this very moment probably divulging        75    00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.270    classified information to the Russians        76    00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.599    but enough about me let's focus on our        77    00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.479    failures many of us failed to make it        78    00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.940    through the ominous Harvard comp process        79    00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.010    we didn't write well enough for the        80    00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.870    Advocate we didn't sing well enough for        81    00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.560    the cracks        82    00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.240    we weren't attractive enough for crimson        83    00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.599    key        84    00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.450    much to Dean caranas delight most of us        85    00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.520    failed to get into exclusive single        86    00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.640    gender social organizations and much to        87    00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.100    Dean kuranes chagrin Harvard's most        88    00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.440    dynamic social space is now a meme page        89    00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:08.130    on Facebook we failed to totally grab a        90    00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.440    meal sometime we failed to really get        91    00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.810    outside the Harvard bubble more we        92    00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.700    failed to show up for intramurals yes        93    00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.990    Winthrop except for you and we failed        94    00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.760    off to fend failed to fend off the        95    00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.570    Freshman Fifteen        96    00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.830    or in my case the freshmen 35 I will        97    00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.780    miss you dearly HUD salted caramel cake        98    00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.680    when you say it out loud        99    00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.560    we sure did fail a lot and I haven't        100    00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.560    even touched my dating life yet but yet        101    00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.780    here we are about to graduate from the        102    00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.990    number one University on the planet shut        103    00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.210    up Princeton us World Report is fake        104    00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:52.680    News so maybe failure a concept as        105    00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.350    unnerving to Harvard students as mumps        106    00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.550    or more recently tuberculosis is        107    00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.790    actually not so bad in fact failing that        108    00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.800    stats midterm led to my much more        109    00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.300    successful tenure as a history        110    00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.120    concentrator not that much more        111    00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.520    successful failing to get into the        112    00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.890    advocate or Crimson key allowed me to        113    00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.480    discover my passion for public service        114    00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.730    at the Institute of Politics or as a        115    00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.330    peer advising fellow in Hollis North        116    00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.950    failing to join a final Club led to me        117    00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.450    meeting friends that will last a        118    00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.030    lifetime to quote one of my favorite        119    00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.580    movies the PBS KIDS classic Arthur's        120    00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.330    perfect Christmas        121    00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.780    you don't always get what you want in        122    00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.330    life sometimes you get something better        123    00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.960    as we wrap up our turn here in this        124    00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.390    hallowed yard and walk out of Johnston        125    00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.210    gate for the very last time most of us        126    00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.040    have a unique and exhilarating path        127    00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.950    before us and the rest of us are working        128    00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.820    for Goldman Sachs        129    00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.360    let us not be afraid to deviate from the        130    00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.370    standard measures of success that have        131    00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.310    so often come to define our time here        132    00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.900    beyond these walls the clothes that you        133    00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.150    wore the likes that your profile picture        134    00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.700    garnered the grades that you received        135    00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.110    hold little weight so please do not be        136    00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.430    afraid to fail because apparently even a        137    00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.990    kid who just last week burned himself        138    00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.410    doing laundry and once ripped his jeans        139    00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.550    taking a nap can stand before you this        140    00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.430    afternoon and speak to the class day for        141    00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.480    the Harvard College class of 2017        142    00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.440    congratulations to everyone seated here        143    00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:43.980    today        144    00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.810    I can't wait to witness all of your        145    00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.270    failures and the successes that they        146    00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.170    lead to thank you        147    00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.480    you

     10    00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.719    you first climb a huge imposing set of        11    00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.920    steps after you do that and you finally        12    00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.280    enter our most Monumental Temple of        13    00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.719    learning you see another imposing set of        14    00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.839    steps and if you're me you pause because        15    00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.000    you're        16    00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.080    winded the whole the whole ordeal feels        17    00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.080    like an architect's heavy-handed attempt        18    00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.170    to teach some lesson like knowledge is        19    00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.000    [Applause]        20    00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.680    hard        21    00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.400    anyway once you catch your breath you        22    00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.040    climb the second set of steps to find at        23    00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.119    the top a Gutenberg        24    00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.439    Bible as you probably know know the        25    00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.119    Gutenberg Bible is the oldest example of        26    00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.720    a book made with a printing press a        27    00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.280    revolutionary Information        28    00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.280    Technology as you probably don't know I        29    00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.920    love books the most exciting part of        30    00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.880    coming to Harvard for me was getting the        31    00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.799    library card because if you love books        32    00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.520    this is a good place to        33    00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.640    be in fact I'll tell you how big our        34    00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.159    collection is here the Librarians aren't        35    00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.880    even sure how many books we have        36    00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.600    that are bound in human        37    00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.920    skin they think probably just one but if        38    00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.840    you don't know how many human bound        39    00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.760    books are in your library you you have a        40    00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.080    lot of        41    00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.760    books of course I don't just love the        42    00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.239    physical books I love what's inside them        43    00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.280    in particular I love literature and        44    00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.879    sacred texts like the Gutenberg Bible so        45    00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.480    in order to study them I came to Harvard        46    00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.080    divinity school which turns 200 this        47    00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.560    year and I'm glad I did because it is a        48    00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.120    magical kooky place where the people are        49    00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.480    always friendly and often know a        50    00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.080    language you've never heard of and        51    00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.800    sometimes bump into you because they're        52    00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.319    doing walking        53    00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.920    meditation and no matter what you just        54    00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.159    said It reminds someone of a line from        55    00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.280    the mystical poet        56    00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.760    roomie of of course every part of this        57    00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.400    University is special students from        58    00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.560    Harvard College and our various graduate        59    00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.959    and professional schools routinely        60    00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.000    become leaders in their fields Nobel        61    00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.760    winning physicists Educators        62    00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.840    [Music]        63    00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.480    billionaires        64    00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.280    poets        65    00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.340    politicians and on and        66    00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.680    [Applause]        67    00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.040    on those books I love many were written        68    00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.080    by Harvard grads and we create not just        69    00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.080    works of literature but law books music        70    00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.239    books the account books of Fortune 500        71    00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.360    companies and quite a few former        72    00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.480    students have had history books written        73    00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.879    about them for instance presidents as        74    00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.480    politically different from one another        75    00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.760    as George W bush and Barack Obama both        76    00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.959    hold degrees from this        77    00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.000    University regardless of your own        78    00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.720    political opinion        79    00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.640    I think you'll agree that Harvard        80    00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.319    graduates have a habit of going on to        81    00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.280    matter to the world for good and for ill        82    00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.200    often at the same        83    00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.280    time and that's where the Divinity        84    00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.040    School comes        85    00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.600    in because though it sits on the edge of        86    00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.400    Campus I believe it is the University's        87    00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.880    moral Center in the chemistry lab and        88    00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.400    the math department        89    00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.400    the goal is to solve problems in the        90    00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.320    Divinity School problems are wrestled        91    00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.800    with but they are never        92    00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.199    vanquished that's because some problems        93    00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.639    just come with being human and they need        94    00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.400    to be confronted Again by each        95    00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.240    generation no new technology no printing        96    00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.240    press or app is going to settle the        97    00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.919    problem of greed or Death Or        98    00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.280    Hate and at the divinity school we think        99    00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.800    about these problems and about how        100    00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.800    people have dealt with them through the        101    00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.919    ages and how to do what right we can in        102    00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.160    the face of all that's        103    00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.080    wrong as it happens that reminds me of a        104    00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.440    line from        105    00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.000    roomie sell your        106    00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.080    cleverness and buy        107    00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.199    bewilderment Harvard graduates will        108    00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.080    change the world one way or another        109    00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.240    because we're clever but we must be more        110    00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.840    than that we must be willing to become        111    00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.000    bewildered neither approaching a problem        112    00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.720    arrogantly sure that we already know the        113    00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.479    answer nor throwing up our hands and        114    00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:49.800    walking        115    00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.800    away becoming bewildered means admitting        116    00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.280    some problems don't have quick        117    00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.880    fixes it means learning from our        118    00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.039    mistakes learning from from the other        119    00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.039    learning what it is we can't        120    00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:06.680    learn and those are things roomie can        121    00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.440    teach us about roomi an immigrant from        122    00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.919    what is now Afghanistan to what is now        123    00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.759    turkey an immigrant from the 13th        124    00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:21.319    century to our own a Muslim        125    00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:25.039    Mystic roomi has something immensely        126    00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.639    valuable to tell us but we have to        127    00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:31.599    listen really hard for it with humility        128    00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:34.720    and for the rest of our        129    00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.599    lives be proud of what you've        130    00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:40.560    accomplished here but know that it's        131    00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.919    only the        132    00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:44.680    beginning earlier I mentioned the lesson        133    00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.039    of the Widener        134    00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:48.840    steps well after a few years here I'm        135    00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.759    sure you'll agree that knowledge is        136    00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:55.599    hard but wisdom is even        137    00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:58.479    harder we'll need both out there        138    00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:01.240    whatever our field of study because this        139    00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.720    world is complex and contradictory and        140    00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.039    if we aren't bewildered sometimes we're        141    00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:08.479    doing it        142    00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:12.080    wrong but we'll go forth anyway to        143    00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.280    change the world and also to be changed        144    00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.879    by it to write our own        145    00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:22.520    books those books may be made of paper        146    00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.879    or published        147    00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:26.639    digitally or what you leave behind May        148    00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:29.240    simply be the legacy of the acts that        149    00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.400    make up a        150    00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.160    life regardless of their        151    00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.759    form your books will be good books if        152    00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:40.639    you are willing to be        153    00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:45.120    bewildered if you take on this messy        154    00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.199    tragic Lovely World and confront its        155    00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:53.410    problems in good faith        156    00:07:53.410 --> 00:08:04.669    [Applause]

    25    00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.130    exciting phase of our lives but to be        26    00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.590    honest when I reviewed my admissions        27    00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.680    file recently when I reread my        28    00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.970    application essay        29    00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.630    thought back on my high school self and        30    00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.850    saw the words pity admits stamped on my        31    00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.880    file and bold red letters I couldn't        32    00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.810    help but wonder are we really ready has        33    00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.320    Harvard taught us enough isn't it kind        34    00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.030    of messed up that they have a stamp for        35    00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.869    that well I don't have the answers to        36    00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.110    those questions and frankly the senior        37    00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.610    class committee isn't paying me five        38    00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.229    grand to stand up here theorizing about        39    00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.610    it        40    00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.290    no the reason I'm standing up here today        41    00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.970    is to tell you one very important thing        42    00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.170    you see over the past four years I have        43    00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.069    kept track of every single song the        44    00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.519    Lowell bell ringers have played and        45    00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.110    hidden within the song titles I have        46    00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.800    uncovered a secret coded message if you        47    00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.260    take the sixth letter of every fourth        48    00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.599    song played on even-numbered Sundays and        49    00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.790    read them backwards you get this message        50    00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.650    please help my adoptive father judge        51    00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.380    Claude Frollo has imprisoned me in this        52    00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.850    bell tower and forbidden me from        53    00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.660    venturing out into the city of Paris        54    00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.090    now I don't know what this message could        55    00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.830    mean but I know one thing I wasted a lot        56    00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.760    of time figuring it out I mean that was        57    00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.099    time I could have spent doing readings        58    00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.860    for class or hanging out with my friends        59    00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:10.620    or studying at Wigan er        60    00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.890    in fact the more I thought about it the        61    00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.230    more I began to fear that I may have        62    00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.240    wasted a lot of my time here at Harvard        63    00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.390    I felt an overwhelming sense of sadness        64    00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.810    like a CS concentrator reading the honor        65    00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.070    code or        66    00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.520    or VES concentrator being asked about        67    00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.210    their plans after graduation or an        68    00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:48.070    applied math concentrator topical I        69    00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.170    asked myself where of the last four        70    00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.920    years gone so I decided to figure it out        71    00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.820    using something dark from my past but        72    00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.040    I'd hoped to leave behind forever math        73    00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.450    now according to my calculations over        74    00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.900    the past four years I spent a total of        75    00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.160    twelve thousand five hundred hours        76    00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.210    sleeping okay for the math savants        77    00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.590    shaking your heads in the audience I        78    00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.570    didn't make a mistake 14 hours a day is        79    00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.230    correct        80    00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.630    I spent 2,000 hours on the internet 500        81    00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.430    hours sitting in lecture so scratch that        82    00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.450    2500 hours on the Internet 400 hours at        83    00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.310    the Mac before I was unfortunately        84    00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.600    banned for being to fit seven hours        85    00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.700    walking to and from the quad that's        86    00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.750    right I went there twice okay        87    00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.000    okay okay easy joke I know again        88    00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.530    David Malan at Harvard year after I'd        89    00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.449    finished doing the math I took a deep        90    00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.500    breath now I knew down to the hour where        91    00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.880    the last four years had gone        92    00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.710    and honestly I found that I wouldn't        93    00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.500    have wanted to change any of it except        94    00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.510    maybe there's four hours I spent trying        95    00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.949    to get Martin shkreli to text me back        96    00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.130    that turned out to be a total bust but I        97    00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.620    realized that I didn't waste my time        98    00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.900    here at all it only feels like that now        99    00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.169    because it's over and I'm going to miss        100    00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:23.350    it        101    00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.889    I chose to dedicate my time to        102    00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.380    uncovering a vast conspiracy hidden in        103    00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.500    the chimes of those infernal bells maybe        104    00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.950    you spent yours working in a lab or        105    00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.150    performing in one of them Harvard's many        106    00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.639    wonderful theater groups or in the Hasty        107    00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.780    Pudding don't worry I'm not offending        108    00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.430    them they couldn't care less what I have        109    00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.010    to say regardless it's the choices        110    00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.570    you've made about how to use your time        111    00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.220    here at Harvard that's given the last        112    00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.530    four years meaning and made you who you        113    00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.370    are today        114    00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.380    jobless narcissists mostly class of 2017        115    00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.389    if I could give you one piece of advice        116    00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.479    and I can because at this point the only        117    00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:09.099    way I can be stopped is if for cash        118    00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:10.870    Khurana gets up and tackles me to the        119    00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.380    ground it would be this don't torture        120    00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.750    yourself for not making the most of your        121    00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.810    time at Harvard it's impossible it's a        122    00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.020    myth and enticing lie like        123    00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.330    individualized advising or visit us        124    00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.420    no one can go to every talk see every        125    00:06:30.420 -->

8    00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.430    irony of encouraging 900 Harvard MBAs to        9    00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.430    speak their mind at first glance it        10    00:00:44.430 -->

over educated by        13    00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.799    professors and over served by bartenders        14    00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:57.420    stocking up on prophetic strategies and        15

   get in that one last time but it is the        18    00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.940    responsibility of the informed to speak        19    00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.409    up when we can make a

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.920    drastically the share of voices in this        23    00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.810    country and the world at large have        24    00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.600

correctly        27    00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.899    appreciate voice as a form of value the        28    00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:38.340    implications of this shift are        29    00:01:38.340

00:02:02.729    world around us as future leaders we        37    00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.200    will likely hold positions where our        38    00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.090    voices will have outsized influence on        39    00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.420    our surroundings so opinion of the on        40    00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.350    current events are not optional        41    00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.959    identities will not wait to be formed we        42    00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.420    must define and defend ourselves with        43    00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.460    thoughts and words        44    00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.890    and expect others around us to do the        45    00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.030    same I do not make this plea to belittle        46    00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.850    quiet as a necessary counterpoint or to        47    00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.900    demote action as a necessary result but        48    00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.320    to admit that at times we fail to summon        49    00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.760    the courage to simply speak some might        50    00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.110    think it's wholly unnecessary to        51    00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.750    encourage MBAs to speak their minds or        52    00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.970    that like any good consultants I'm just        53    00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.870    telling you something you've heard        54    00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.810    before but with fancier words and then        55    00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.400    I'll probably send you an invoice after        56    00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.470    I've sufficiently worn you down all        57    00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.270    forms of payment are accepted but I        58    00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.800    prefer claims on the future earnings of        59    00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.350    anyone in cbcr but even among so many        60    00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.110    extroverts I think there's more here to        61    00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.640    explore in fact this speech itself is an        62    00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.090    exercise in self-control Dhin myself        63    00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.310    accountable for as long as YouTube and        64    00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.530    it's balanced thoughtful commenters        65    00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.690    shall live because in my experience        66    00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.800    speaking up has not always come        67    00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.980    naturally I challenge myself to think        68    00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.470    through this topic because my struggle        69    00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.770    with it is both long-held and ongoing as        70    00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.900    a gay 15 year old in the conservative        71    00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.660    Midwest silent smothered me I remember        72    00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.430    realizing that more than the way I        73    00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.130    walked or the way I dressed it was        74    00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.770    really the way I talked that prompted        75    00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.670    people to label me more specifically it        76    00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.770    was the way I said the letter F my F is        77    00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.920    sibilant or characterized by a hissing        78    00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.310    sound and I thought if I could mask my F        79    00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.200    then I could mask myself so first I try        80    00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.800    changing the way I pronounced words I        81    00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.299    like sports should be I like sports        82    00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.000    which I am totally definitely do        83    00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.069    after I very obviously failed at this I        84    00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:28.599    then tried to figure out how I could        85    00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.139    speak without saying s so much how to        86    00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.690    substitute words without that one pesky        87    00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.000    little letter for example instead of        88    00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.830    salutation section mates such a strong        89    00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.199    sweat were sporting in a surprise Summer        90    00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:52.330    Sun I might say hi I'm warm needless to        91    00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.490    say a brevity did not come easily to me        92    00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.780    and neither did hiding my identity it        93    00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.789    was not until years later that I        94    00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.099    realized how much I had been silencing        95    00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:07.000    myself I also realized that the        96    00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.729    processes of discovering oneself and        97    00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.409    revealing run self run parallel some of        98    00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:16.599    my thoughts didn't crystallize until I        99    00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:20.440    pushed myself to say them out loud but        100    00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.250    that is not a dynamic unique to me I        101    00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.569    didn't want to face confrontation for        102    00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:28.860    what I was saying or how I was saying it        103    00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.849    isn't that something we all can relate        104    00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.990    to there are ideas inside each of us        105    00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.150    that should be articulated both        106    00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.250    endorsements and opposition's that        107    00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.039    should be brought forth and for one        108    00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:46.330    reason or another they aren't so then        109    00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.219    why should we fight against the human        110    00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:51.610    instinct to protect ourselves because as        111    00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.860    this institution has reminded us time        112    00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.099    and again that's what leaders who make a        113    00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:01.270    difference in the world do those topics        114    00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.560    we were taught not to discuss at the        115    00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.259    dinner table money politics religion        116    00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:08.770    well money politics religion class color        117    00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.479    weakness wants this country seems the        118    00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:15.400    most divided it's been in any of our        119    00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.020    lifetimes and it will stay that way as        120    00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.300    long as people avoid engaging with other        121    00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.710    points of view now is not the time to        122    00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.630    shy away from topics that might make us        123    00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.419    uncomfortable or opinions that might        124    00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:33.800    make us unpopular        125    00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.420    but of course there are times when we        126    00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.300    all do exactly that        127    00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.530    try to think of a time when you didn't        128    00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.050    stand up for an idea or opinion or a        129    00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.150    person maybe it was yourself and try to        130    00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.170    identify exactly why you didn't the        131    00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.210    reason might be like all things when        132    00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.440    you're cold called and haven't read the        133    00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.490    case contextual but it's probably        134    00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:06.510    something far more universal fear there        135    00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.030    are times we don't speak up for fear of        136    00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.380    being redundant because we think what we        137    00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.300    believe has already been voiced that our        138    00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.610    opinion is the opinion that the silent        139    00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.760    majority will carry the day and many        140    00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.140    times it does and we face no consequence        141    00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.300    but therein lies the danger if we all        142    00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.610    remain silent on topics for which we        143    00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.790    believe others will speak on our behalf        144    00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:36.320    there will come a day when no one does        145    00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.580    there are times when we don't speak up        146    00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.390    for fear of being inappropriate some of        147    00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.650    us find it easier to raise the        148    00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.210    counterpoint sitting around a conference        149    00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.210    room table others around the dining room        150    00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.490    table but whether you're more at home        151    00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.440    surrounded by reassuring facts and        152    00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.050    figures or by friends who sympathize        153    00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.230    with our exact points of view we must        154    00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.140    fight the urge to reserve our voices for        155    00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.460    the spaces where we feel most        156    00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.730    comfortable we cannot separate our lives        157    00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.640    into personal opinions and professional        158    00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.390    actions that do not align we cannot        159    00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.610    insulate ourselves from the world around        160    00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:19.910    us by retreating to a corner office and        161    00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.440    there are times where we don't speak up        162    00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.970    for fear of being wrong because we're        163    00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.070    waiting for the perfect data the perfect        164    00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.520    moment the perfect answer but there is        165    00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.300    real value in expressing uncertainty        166    00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.070    there may not be scribes in every one of        167    00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.110    our future conference rooms but in the        168    00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.180    real world questions still count for        169    00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.110    something        170    00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.810    and by asking questions by exposing        171    00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.630    ourselves in this way we encourage        172    00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:52.740    others to do the same it is better to        173    00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.040    engage imperfectly then abstain        174    00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:02.480    indefinitely now I could stop here but        175    00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.769    let's let that man the first row doze        176    00:09:04.769 --> 00:09:07.560    off for a few more minutes oh that's my        177    00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.410    dad's can someone wake him up okay great        178    00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.769    thank you and furthermore if I were to        179    00:09:13.769 --> 00:09:17.209    stop here my message would be incomplete        180    00:09:17.209 --> 00:09:20.160    this mindset should not prioritize our        181    00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.490    opinions leaders opinion above anyone        182    00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.579    elses rather it should set the norm for        183    00:09:26.579 --> 00:09:30.540    all if we value our own voices enough to        184    00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.880    use them as tools of change then we must        185    00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.709    also listen to the voices of others and        186    00:09:34.709 --> 00:09:38.430    enable them to do just the same while        187    00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.959    it's easy to listen to those who agree        188    00:09:39.959 --> 00:09:42.329    with us some of my most potent memories        189    00:09:42.329 --> 00:09:45.450    of classmates speaking up for those who        190    00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.839    totally shut me down remember when that        191    00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:50.730    section aid blew up classroom discussion        192    00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.890    by questioning an assumption the rest of        193    00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:55.320    us had taken for granted or when someone        194    00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.180    disagreed with you and actually changed        195    00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.410    your mind the great moments in HBS        196    00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.480    classrooms reveal the empathy of our        197    00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.940    education taking the point of view of a        198    00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.060    protagonist their personal baggage        199    00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.649    professional backgrounds and present        200    00:10:10.649 --> 00:10:13.110    challenges and charting a path forward        201    00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.170    but the best moments in the HBS        202    00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.959    classroom also take advantage of the        203    00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:20.579    empathy amongst 90 different        204    00:10:20.579 --> 00:10:23.940    perspectives within the classroom I hope        205    00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.470    we don't let that less and leave us once        206    00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.470    we cross this threshold we must listen        207    00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.160    to those who speak up both alongside and        208    00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.610    against us we must embrace dissenters        209    00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:40.100    even when it seems inconvenient we must        210    00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:44.279    value the voices of our doubters as much        211    00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:48.329    as those of our champions this is our        212    00:10:48.329 --> 00:10:50.279    responsibility not just to ourselves as        213    00:10:50.279 --> 00:10:54.840    people but to our identities as leaders        214    00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.980    listening is good for maintaining        215    00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.070    perspective listening is good to combat        216    00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.950    consensus to dispel groupthink to burst        217    00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.840    bubbles be there in financial markets or        218    00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.710    national politics listening is also good        219    00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:09.850    if you're an asthma prone        220    00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.680    environmentalist climbing Everest with a        221    00:11:11.680 -->

today when we gather to        224    00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.750    celebrate our commencement to thank all        225    00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.660    of those who helped us get here and most        226    00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.210    importantly to amass the most Instagram        227    00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:31.600    live likes of our lives thus far let's        228    00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.880    hold ourself responsible to a new normal        229    00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.930    for MBAs no matter what critics might        230    00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:41.800    say

00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.460    silence        236    00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:03.780    find your voice share your voice and        237    00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.420    welcome the voices of others there are        238    00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.270    times when this might be off-brand but        239    00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.750    it will certainly keep us on track thank        240    00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:14.820    you        241    00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:33.409    [Applause]        
"Jun 22, 2017",commencement,video,lDO79OfFqPI,Commencement 2017: Dean Michelle Williams address,"As you step into this next chapter, each one of you will face rare challenges—but also opportunities. Events have shocked us into action—and into a new solidarity and sense of shared mission. This is a resource of tremendous power, ours to use or squander.        If there is one quality these times demand it is agility, a word that I have thought of a lot during this academic year. Agility means for me and for many of us the capacity to see openings and quickly act on them—and I witnessed you all being agile during times of distress during this academic year. Agility also means to think creatively, to leverage circumstances—and I saw all you respond with great agility during this academic year.        To this end, I urge you to seek common ground with those you may be tempted to write off. In a world as polarized as ours is today, this can feel daunting. It is daunting. But I also think it is essential.        -- Harvard Chan Dean Michelle Williams",Harvard T.H.

   which is how you rallied around Muhammad        99    00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.260    after he was barred from returning to        100    00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.610    this country you saw that he had class        101    00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.880    notes you even Skyped with him and        102    00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.830    Skyped him into lectures I have seen it        103    00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.160    in your work your work to expand health        104    00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.440    care for those who need it most        105    00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.940    from Haiti to Angola from New Jersey to        106    00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.680    Mexico and of course right here in        107    00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.680    Boston        108    00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.759    you have combined your study of public        109    00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:22.210    health with your commitment to public        110    00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:28.150    health service in these ways and so many        111    00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.300    more you have shown awareness that        112    00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.759    public health is far more than a        113    00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:37.150    profession far more than an academic        114    00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:42.180    discipline public health is a movement        115    00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.669    nevertheless this has been more        116    00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:46.380    empowering        117    00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.650    domore impact apparent than it is today        118    00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.280    in the words of writer roberta soul        119    00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.479    rebecca sonic we write history with our        120

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.240    to defend the science of climate change        128    00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.169    and denounced efforts to turn back the        129    00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:40.870    clock on environmental protections now        130    00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.900    more than ever we need to build on such        131    00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.250    stellar leadership to rise to raise the        132    00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.610    public voice of Public Health how do we        133    00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:55.000    reach people and change minds what are        134    00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.670    the most productive ways to stand up for        135    00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:02.070    our values these are questions that we        136    00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:08.410    have to confront in their answers lies        137    00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:13.290    the future of the public health movement        138    00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.540    every one of you is part of this        139    00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.600    movement as graduates of this great        140    00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.410    school you take your place in an        141    00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.370    extraordinary lineage of public health        142    00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:32.920    activists visionaries and educators one        143    00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.730    of the earliest public health activists        144    00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.420    and visionaries was Alice Hamilton who        145    00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:44.350    in 1919 became Harvard's first female        146    00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:49.240    faculty member a pacifist and advocate        147    00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.880    for women's rights        148    00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.080    Hamilton conducted groundbreaking        149    00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.960    research on dangerous workplace        150    00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.950    conditions        151    00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:01.230    she began her teaching career in Chicago        152    00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.390    drawn by the opportunity to live with        153    00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:08.190    immigrants and the poor in Jane Addams        154    00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:13.630    legendary whole house looking back on        155    00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:19.210    her early life at the age of 88 she had        156    00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:23.530    this to say and I quote for me the        157    00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:26.410    satisfaction is that things are better        158    00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:33.070    now and I had some part in it another        159    00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:37.120    great inspiration is the late Jonathan        160    00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.320    Mann the founding director of our fxb        161    00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.339    Center and the first head of the World        162    00:10:45.339 --> 00:10:46.870    Health Organisation's        163    00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:52.030    global programs on AIDS dr. Mann brought        164    00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:56.050    together the world of health and science        165    00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:00.250    with human rights fields that until then        166    00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:03.300    had little to do with each other        167    00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:07.510    he cast light on public health dangers        168    00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:11.490    posed by silence exclusions and        169    00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:17.500    isolation work has resonant today        170    00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:24.220    it was in the 1980s I think two of many        171    00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.390    Harvard Chan alumni who who are at work        172    00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:33.250    now today in the field of Monica Burrell        173    00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:38.590    a member of the class of 2012 who now        174    00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.110    serve as the state's Commissioner of        175    00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:44.200    Public Health and has trained her sights        176    00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.260    on combating opioid abuse and health        177    00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.520    disparities I also think of Willie        178    00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:57.550    Parker a member of the class of 1998 who        179    00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.400    has emerged as a champion of        180    00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.190    reproductive health choice in the deep        181    00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.790    south often flying in from out of state        182    00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:11.950    to serve women in need I also think of        183    00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:15.120    Annie Sparrow a member of the class of        184    00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.420    2004 who travels back and forth from New        185    00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.380    York to Syria's Turkish borders where        186    00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.290    she trained medical providers on the        187    00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.290    frontlines of the nation's bloody civil        188    00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:35.140    war and the list goes on and on now it        189    00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.680    is your turn it is your turn and your        190    00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.450    time to take up the torch what a force        191    00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:47.140    you are with your brilliance your

00:14:32.800    events have shocked us into action and        216    00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.470    into a new solidarity and sense of        217    00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:41.000    shared mission this is a resource of a        218    00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.900    tremendous power ours to use or squander        219    00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.120    if there is one quality these times        220    00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:54.860    demands it is agility agility a words        221    00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.930    that I have thought of a lot throughout        222    00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.540    this academic year        223    00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.420    agility means for me and for many of us        224    00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:06.980    the capacity to see opening and quickly        225    00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.370    act on them and I witnessed you all        226    00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:15.100    being agile during times of distress        227    00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.080    during this academic        228    00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.220    your agility also means to think        229    00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.580    creatively and to leverage circumstances        230    00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:28.720    and I saw you all responds with great        231    00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:34.030    agility during this academic year to        232    00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:34.720    this end        233    00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.410    I urge you to continue to seek common        234    00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.320    ground with those you may be tempted to        235    00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.070    write off in a world as polarized as        236    00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:49.470    ours is today this can feel daunting it        237    00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.900    is daunting but I also think it's        238    00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:58.300    essential the emblem of this year's        239    00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.470    festivities is a light bulb this is a        240    00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:05.710    part of a playful tradition sorry for        241    00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:07.510    Walter Willett we don't have roots this        242    00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:14.680    year but these phone light bulbs that        243    00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.880    many of you received this morning are        244    00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.940    our symbol for this year and that said        245    00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:26.230    as I prepare to send you off I also see        246    00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.140    a deeper meaning in the symbol these        247    00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.950    lights stand for power they stand for        248    00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:37.950    hope those lights are you        249    00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:41.820    I often think of these words from one of        250    00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.750    my favorite writers Maya Angelou she        251    00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:50.580    wrote when you learn teach when you get        252    00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:54.060    give as graduates of this great school        253    00:16:54.060 -->

events of last November and        256    00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.970    most of us continue to grapple grapple        257    00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:15.630    with what they mean and what they call        258    00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:19.290    on us to do and while I don't have all        259    00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:24.329    the answers I do know this you are the        260    00:17:24.329

crowd and said        29    00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.159    I'm going to quote him and everything he        30    00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.840    said he said graduates we the older        31    00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.240    generation are leaving you a perfect        32    00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.880    world don't Lous it up and then he sat        33    00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.719    down well we are not leaving the        34    00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.079    graduates the world that maybe you all        35    00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.840    want the world you find is far from        36    00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.680    perfect one of the many challenges is        37    00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.079    our divisions in this country and around        38    00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.360    the globe divisions between people who        39    00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.520    identify with different        40    00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.000    nationalities religions races genders        41    00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.160    regions political groups news sources        42    00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.080    and        43    00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.440    appearances dividing ourselves into        44    00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.840    groups based on feelings of connection        45    00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.319    with some and perhaps antipathies        46    00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.280    towards others may be an inescapable        47    00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.000    feature of human neurology because we        48    00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.560    rely on schemas and        49    00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.080    stereotypes but cross human history        50    00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.120    group affiliations have offered meaning        51    00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.400    and comfort and yes also the risk of        52    00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.159    stereotyping mistrusting and mistreating        53    00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.400    people we see as others you the        54    00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.760    graduates of Harvard Law School came        55    00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.959    here from cities and towns and rural        56    00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.159    areas across the globe you have diverse        57    00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.920    experiences and identities and yet you        58    00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.400    share something indelible that something        59    00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.040    drew you to law and to the pursuit of of        60    00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.560    justice for all that something motivated        61    00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.799    you to study debate engage and serve you        62    00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.319    will always have in common this school        63    00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.560    and the experiences of bridging        64    00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.680    differences without erasing them you may        65    00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.360    identify with different groups but now        66    00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.599    you will forever be members of the        67    00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.720    Harvard Law School        68    00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.959    family that means that among so many        69    00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.239    other ways to identify you choose to use        70    00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.879    your capacities to develop rigorous ways        71    00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.280    to tell stories to think to express and        72    00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.599    to convince and that means that the        73    00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.360    friendships and memories and        74    00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.519    possibilities for connection forged here        75    00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.840    will endure for the rest of your lives        76    00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.159    it means that you will take places where        77    00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.799    you belong and you will challenge them        78    00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.079    to be better it means that you will        79    00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.480    question and reason and act and it means        80    00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.840    you will contribute your lives to the        81    00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.680    shared

I applaud your choice as I'm        127    00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.199    convinced that education is the only        128    00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:38.639    long-term solution to these long-term        129    00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.120    problems for that        130    00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.479    reason for that reason I believe that        131    00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.120    you

134    00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.120    education and there is no higher calling        135    00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.840    no more rewarding or meaningful field in        136    00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.840    which to work I hope and trust you feel        137    00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.879    prepared and inspired for the tasks that        138    00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:09.319    lie ahead I am confident you will change        139    00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:12.120    the world and change it for the better I        140    00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.280    ground my confidence in        141    00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.720    particular in in your reaction to the        142    00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.160    presidential election I know that the        143    00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.639    result of the election was deeply        144    00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:22.440    disappointing for many of you this is        145    00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.520    not meant to be partisan or        146    00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.759    disrespectful but simply to State a fact        147    00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:28.360    about the world or at least our corner        148    00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.039    of it what was most impressive to me        149    00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:34.199    however was your response in the face of        150    00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:35.680    the deep divisions the election        151    00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.039    highlighted you responded with concern        152    00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:42.160    but also with care compassion empathy        153    00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.639    and most importantly with love which        154    00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:48.039    will always conquer fear in the long run        155    00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:50.159    I think each class at hgse has a        156    00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:52.199    defining quality and I've come to think        157    00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:54.280    of your class as exceptionally        158    00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.440    big-hearted in large part because of        159    00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.360    what I saw of your Collective character        160    00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.680    after the election from a rally about        161    00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.159    solidarity to your participation in a        162    00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:05.840    Dean's design challenge meant to offer        163    00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.800    help and ideas to teachers and        164    00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.199    principles looking to reduce bullying        165    00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:12.639    discrimination and harassment your        166    00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:14.800    big-heartedness became crystal clear to        167    00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.960    me when I recently attended the art        168    00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.720    installation around the theme of Love in        169

00:09:21.360    your        191    00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.680    hearts which leads me back to the topic        192    00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.440    of the day        193    00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.320    grace let me say right up front that I        194    00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.240    truly love the idea of Grace and I've        195    00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.320    been fascinated by the word and the        196    00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.040    constellation of Concepts it represents        197    00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.000    for a very long time I've come to        198    00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.440    believe that Grace is a remarkably        199    00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.760    powerful word but it's also somewhat        200    00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.600    Elusive and mysterious as we'll get to        201    00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.399    this means that in a sense by suggesting        202    00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:49.440    that you lead with Grace which is        203    00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.720    difficult to Define I may be offering        204    00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.519    completely meaningless advice which is        205    00:09:54.519 --> 00:09:56.440    unfortunate but perhaps fitting given        206    00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.320    that this is a graduation speech and I        207    00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.440    am a dean        208    00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.920    meaningless advice sort of comes with        209    00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.279    the        210    00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:05.120    territory I want to tell you about my        211    00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.399    own quest to understand Grace which        212    00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:09.279    began with family dinners and then a        213    00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:11.720    priest which in turn led me to study Dr        214    00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.720    J Eleanor Roosevelt and Jackie Kennedy        215    00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.839    credit cards Greek mythology Roman        216    00:10:16.839 --> 00:10:19.440    philosophers and finally The        217    00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.680    Simpsons let me explain my first        218    00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.519    encounter with the term Grace came when        219    00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:26.079    I was a young child growing up in a        220    00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:28.160    faithful Catholic Family where we said a        221    00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.320    prayer of thanks before dinner which we        222    00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.560    refer to as saying grace I thought as a        223    00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.519    result that Grace meant giving thanks        224    00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:38.360    and in one sense it does no sooner did I        225    00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.440    think I understood the term however than        226    00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.880    I was confused by it as this was my        227    00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.000    first and this was my first inkling of        228    00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.360    the mystery and power of the word I        229    00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.320    became confused because my Parish priest        230    00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.680    often ended mass by suggesting that we        231    00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.880    go in peace and go with Grace I got the        232    00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.200    first part about peace which is why I        233    00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.200    always waited until we got to our family        234    00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.600    car after Mass before I began fighting        235    00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.720    with my        236    00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.920    sister but I didn't understand what the        237    00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.680    priest meant by go with Grace each time        238    00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.760    he said this I reflexively looked around        239    00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.560    to see if my Aunt Mary Grace was in        240    00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.360    church because I thought he was        241    00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.920    literally telling me to go home with my        242    00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.839    aunt Grace but that seemed odd to me and        243    00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:21.399    probably not what he was suggesting        244    00:11:21.399 --> 00:11:23.000    still I had no idea what he was talking        245    00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000    about by the way I should say that years        246    00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.279    later I Googled the phrase go with Grace        247    00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:29.360    and I discovered that go with Grace is        248    00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.959    actually the name of a tour bus company        249    00:11:30.959 --> 00:11:32.959    in        250    00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:36.760    Michigan that takes travelers to        251    00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.240    casinos and is run by a woman named        252    00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.279    Grace but I'm pretty sure that's not        253    00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:44.639    what my priest was suggesting either in        254    00:11:44.639 --> 00:11:46.240    a way I've been trying to figure out        255    00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.279    what he meant to by go with Grace ever        256    00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:50.360    since I learned through Sunday school        257    00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.200    about the Christian concept of God's        258    00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.279    grace the mysterious mixture of love and        259    00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:57.480    mercy that God bestows on Fallen Mortals        260    00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.920    regardless of whether they deserve it or        261    00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.959    not so for a while I thought that Grace        262    00:12:00.959 --> 00:12:03.200    was simply a religious word and indeed        263    00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.160    it is an important one not just for        264    00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.480    Christian religions but also for a host        265    00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.120    of others including Judaism Islam and        266    00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.800    Hinduism it was Julius Irving however        267    00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.040    who taught me that Grace also has a        268    00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.199    secular meaning because he showed me        269    00:12:18.199 --> 00:12:20.680    what it means to be graceful Julius        270    00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.639    Irving or Dr J as he was called played        271    00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:26.440    basketball for the Philadelphia 76ers        272    00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.360    from the mid 1970s to the late 1980s I        273    00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.760    was a huge sports fan and spent a lot of        274    00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.160    time watching sports in front of the        275    00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.160    television as a kid mostly because the        276    00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.760    iPhone hadn't been invented yet Dr J was        277    00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.519    like no other player I had ever seen he        278    00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:44.519    moved like flowing water and he eluded        279    00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:46.440    Defenders as if they were suspended in        280    00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.600    time indeed he himself seemed less        281    00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.639    beholden to either gravity or time than        282    00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:52.959    anyone else on the court to to watch him        283    00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:55.560    play was to be transfixed and to realize        284    00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.199    he had a quality that you and others        285    00:12:57.199 --> 00:12:59.639    lacked and that quality was Grace        286    00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:01.920    in Dr J Grace was a combination        287    00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.279    combination of Elegance and confidence        288    00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:06.639    leavened with a certain quietness and        289    00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:10.160    humility I loved Dr J because I too        290    00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.519    played basketball but I only had one of        291    00:13:12.519 --> 00:13:15.480    his qualities        292    00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.040    humility and that was appropriate        293    00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.160    because I was not very good my only real        294    00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.000    talent was causing opposing players to        295    00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.920    foul Me by knocking me        296    00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.279    down which meant that I was an expert in        297    00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:29.519    getting run over by larger and faster        298    00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:31.920    players this was useful to my team but        299    00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.720    taking a charge it was called was not        300    00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.680    exactly        301    00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.079    graceful I came to appreciate additional        302    00:13:37.079 --> 00:13:38.560    aspects of grace through my admittedly        303    00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.000    somewhat odd obsession with first ladies        304    00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.040    particularly Elanor Roosevelt and Jackie        305    00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.519    Kennedy both of whom I admire and have        306    00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:48.279    learned from Elanor Roosevelt taught me        307    00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:50.120    the true meaning of graciousness and        308    00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.320    Jackie Kennedy taught me that authentic        309    00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.759    style and courage are also a part of        310    00:13:54.759 --> 00:13:58.040    Grace as for elanar as I imagine her        311    00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.279    insisting I call her in our imaginary        312    00:14:03.079 --> 00:14:05.360    conversations and I respond by saying        313    00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.399    please call me at Dean D at Dean Jim        314    00:14:07.399 --> 00:14:09.600    Ryan just like my kids        315    00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.920    do do I tell you I'm slightly obsessed        316    00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.680    with Elanor roselt in any event there's        317    00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.759    a fairly well-known story about her and        318    00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:18.360    a dinner she was hosting at the White        319    00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.199    House during that dinner a guest        320    00:14:20.199 --> 00:14:23.320    mistakenly drank from his finger Bowl to        321    00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.440    spare him any embarrassment Elanor        322    00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.800    immediately drank from her finger bowl        323    00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.120    and then the rest of her guests follow        324    00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.720    follow in this small gesture Elanor        325    00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.399    Roosevelt showed that graciousness is        326    00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:35.480    not about good manners or assiduously        327    00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.240    following etiquette as is sometimes        328    00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.360    thought true graciousness is about        329    00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.560    empathy and inclusion about other making        330    00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.440    others feel welcome Jackie Kennedy in        331    00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.800    turn had mesmerizing style an uncanny        332    00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.240    combination of AR addition charm and        333    00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.320    aloofness that was unique and authentic        334    00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.839    to her she also showed remarkable        335    00:14:54.839 --> 00:14:57.120    courage and composure after her husband        336    00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.279    JFK was assassinated Ernest Hemingway is        337    00:15:00.279 --> 00:15:02.160    credited with defining courage as Grace        338    00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.240    Under Pressure and this is precisely        339    00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.680    what Jackie Kennedy showed in the        340    00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.680    aftermath of the assassination of her        341    00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.399    husband in these ways Elanor Roosevelt        342    00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:12.320    and Jackie Kennedy widened in my mind        343    00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.600    the scope of Grace to include not just        344    00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.199    elegance and quiet confidence but also        345    00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:19.279    graciousness toward others as well as        346    00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:22.839    style and courage credit cards oddly        347    00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:25.000    enough introduced me to yet another        348    00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.240    wonderful facet of Grace unearned        349    00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.240    forgiveness        350    00:15:31.079 --> 00:15:32.880    this came in the form of the so-called        351    00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.240    grace period which was a period after        352    00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.040    the official due date during which you        353    00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.920    could submit payment without incurring        354    00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.240    any late        355    00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.680    fees let's just say that the grace        356    00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.360    period was a familiar and fairly        357    00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.800    important part of my life in my early        358    00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.160    20s I never understood why credit card        359    00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.639    companies didn't just simply shift the        360    00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:52.319    due date back a bit but that's probably        361    00:15:52.319 --> 00:15:53.560    because I didn't yet understand        362    00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.920    behavioral        363    00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.120    economics regardless I didn't complain        364    00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.880    but instead came to depend upon the        365    00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.519    concept of Grace as forgiveness        366    00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:03.759    Financial or otherwise so I learned from        367    00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:05.240    these examples that Grace is about        368    00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.160    gratitude it's about elegance and        369    00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.000    confidence and movement which is usually        370    00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.959    what we mean by graceful and it's about        371    00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:12.920    empathy and inclusion which is to me the        372    00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.360    true meaning of the word graciousness        373    00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.240    grace is about authentic style and        374    00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.680    courage and it's about forgiveness but        375    00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.519    even these examples don't do complete        376    00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:23.440    Justice to the word whether you look        377    00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.199    back in time or across the modern        378    00:16:25.199 --> 00:16:27.399    landscape you see varied examples and        379    00:16:27.399 --> 00:16:29.120    descriptions of Grace everywhere you you        380    00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.079    look in Greek mythology The Three Graces        381    00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:35.000    represented charm Beauty and creativity        382    00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.880    Roman philosophers like senica and        383    00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.160    Cicero considered Grace of virtue and        384    00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.160    modern philosophers continue to study        385    00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.880    Grace today defining it as an act of        386    00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.680    unmar favor or as an inclination to        387    00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.360    promote others interests and bring them        388    00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.800    Joy yet Grace is not just the subject of        389    00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.160    secular philosophers it's also as        390    00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.839    mentioned a deeply spiritual word and        391    00:16:55.839 --> 00:16:58.319    yet there is still more there are Grace        392    00:16:58.319 --> 00:17:00.480    notes that composers use to embellish        393    00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.519    their scores and there's the Beloved        394    00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:05.559    hymn Amazing Grace there are some who        395    00:17:05.559 --> 00:17:08.039    grace us with their presence and others        396    00:17:08.039 --> 00:17:10.679    who fall from grace there are graceful        397    00:17:10.679 --> 00:17:13.640    entrances and there are graceful exits        398    00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.959    Grace also has a lot of Companions and        399    00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:17.919    travels through the world arm in-arm        400    00:17:17.919 --> 00:17:20.559    with a posy of other terms so we        401    00:17:20.559 --> 00:17:22.720    regularly hear not just of Grace but of        402    00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.160    Grace and dignity grace and mercy grace        403    00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.400    and beauty and Grace and courtesy in my        404    00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.960    view there is no other word in the        405    00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.080    English language quite like Grace in its        406    00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.039    depth breadth and complexity Grace        407    00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:38.520    represents and embodies an alluring and        408    00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.000    unique collection of traits and actions        409    00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.559    that are bound together by no other word        410    00:17:43.559 --> 00:17:46.880    in this sense Grace calls to mind or my        411    00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.960    mind at least a classic scene from The        412    00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.559    Simpsons where Homer Simpson asks his        413    00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:55.159    daughter Lisa who has declared herself a        414    00:17:55.159 --> 00:17:57.159    vegetarian if she really means that        415    00:17:57.159 --> 00:17:59.039    she's not going to eat meat from any        416    00:17:59.039 --> 00:18:02.559    animal ever again what about bacon Homer        417    00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:03.640    asks        418    00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.360    incredulously or ham or pork        419    00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.679    chops Homer clearly thinks that these        420    00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:12.960    meats all come from different        421    00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.640    animals Lisa replies dad those all come        422    00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.960    from the same animal and Homer says yeah        423    00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:25.840    right some wonderful Magical Animal        424    00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.840    [Applause]        425    00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:35.240    Grace is a wonderful magical word grace        426    00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.880    is where style and substance meet Grace        427    00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.320    is about the seemingly super superficial        428    00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.880    but properly understood the genuinely        429    00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.080    profound Grace is a way of moving        430    00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.280    through the physical world and a way of        431    00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.720    touching the realm of the spiritual it        432    00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.240    is a concept that is what at once both        433    00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.840    evocative and Elusive it is also a        434    00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.480    concept that seems somewhat nostalgic        435    00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.960    and countercultural in a world that is        436    00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.679    often both too harsh and too coarse a        437    00:19:02.679 --> 00:19:05.480    world where brashness and bravado seem        438    00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.840    far more common and rewarded than the        439    00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.760    gentler and subtler acts and art of        440    00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.159    Grace all of this leaves me deeply        441    00:19:14.159 --> 00:19:16.480    admiring of the multifaceted concept of        442    00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.880    Grace and all that it embodies and it's        443    00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.039    for this reason that I'd like to suggest        444    00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:23.840    that you lead with        445    00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.200    Grace I mean lead here in two senses of        446    00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.120    the word        447    00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.880    lead first when in doubt lead with or        448    00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.960    you might say go with Grace this is how        449    00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.880    I've personally come to understand what        450    00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.960    my Parish priest was telling us years        451    00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.480    ago though I'm still not sure it's what        452    00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.000    he had in mind but to me it's not a bad        453    00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.799    idea when unsure what to do or how to        454    00:19:46.799 --> 00:19:49.559    respond to Life's various challenges to        455    00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:53.080    lead with to go with grace to ask        456    00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.480    yourself in other words what it would        457    00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.600    mean to act or respond graciously or        458    00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.200    gracefully my speech last year was about        459    00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.240    essential questions you might think of        460    00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.000    this year's speech as about an essential        461    00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.080    answer and that answer is        462    00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.600    Grace and suggesting that you lead with        463    00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.720    Grace I'm also referring to the fact        464    00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.120    that if you aren't already you are all        465    00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.120    going to be leader someday and someday        466    00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.400    soon in ways both large and small        467    00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.799    collectively you will lead classrooms        468    00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:25.240    schools school systems organizations and        469    00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.679    offices you will lead in home rooms and        470    00:20:27.679 --> 00:20:29.799    in boardrooms you will be leaders in        471    00:20:29.799 --> 00:20:32.159    politics and leaders in your families        472    00:20:32.159 --> 00:20:33.840    you will lead in your communities and in        473    00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.280    your countries and my simply simple and        474    00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.960    my simple plea is this lead with grace        475    00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.480    to lead with grace to me means to lead        476    00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.480    with gratitude and with courage it means        477    00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.520    to lead with forgiveness and to lead in        478    00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.520    the service of others it means to lead        479    00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.000    with authenticity and with a combination        480    00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.159    of confidence and humility this is what        481    00:20:53.159 --> 00:20:55.640    I mean in brief as I learned many years        482    00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.080    ago Grace is about gratitude and to lead        483    00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.000    with Grace is to lead grateful for the        484    00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.120    opportunity and with thanks to those        485    00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.760    around you to lead is a privilege        486    00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.320    partially earned and partially due to        487    00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.520    all sorts of luck and to lead well is        488    00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.039    necessarily to rely on others those who        489    00:21:11.039 --> 00:21:13.200    have entrusted you to lead and those on        490    00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.799    whom you depend deserve your gratitude        491    00:21:15.799 --> 00:21:17.360    and you shouldn't hesitate to show it        492    00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.360    every chance you can to lead with Grace        493    00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.320    is also to lead with courage Grace isn't        494    00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.480    about being a pushover in order to make        495    00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.039    everyone feel good it's more about quiet        496    00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:28.760    determination        497    00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.559    As Leaders you'll face all sorts of        498    00:21:30.559 --> 00:21:31.919    pressures and you may be tempted to        499    00:21:31.919 --> 00:21:34.600    choose the expedient over the difficult        500    00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.559    to lead with courage to lead with Grace        501    00:21:37.559 --> 00:21:39.880    Under Pressure is to choose the right        502    00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.080    path even if it's not the easiest or        503    00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.120    most popular one it means having the        504    00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.520    foresight in the fortitude not to        505    00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.880    respond to insult with insult but to        506    00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.320    rise above and to have the strength        507    00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.320    above all not to blame others but        508    00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.440    instead to accept the responsibility        509    00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.679    that comes with leadership at the same        510    00:21:57.679 --> 00:21:59.279    time to lead with great is to lead with        511    00:21:59.279 --> 00:22:02.760    a forgiving heart to recognize as D Dr        512    00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.760    Martin Luther King Jr once said that        513    00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.000    forgiveness is not an occasional act but        514    00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.039    a constant attitude is to recognize and        515    00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:13.080    appreciate human Frailty including your        516    00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.840    own to know that mistakes are inevitable        517    00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.240    that no one is as bad as his worst act        518    00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.880    and to believe that Redemption and        519    00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.400    Rehabilitation are always possible above        520    00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.960    all it's to lead with an appreciation of        521    00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.480    the awesome and ultimately self- rming        522    00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.080    power you'll Poss possess to forgive        523    00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.559    others to lead with Grace is also to        524    00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:34.400    lead in the service of others as a story        525    00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.159    about Elanor Roosevelt suggests to be        526    00:22:37.159 --> 00:22:40.279    gracious is to make others feel at ease        527    00:22:40.279 --> 00:22:43.440    to selflessly provide others in a sense        528    00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.480    the opportunity to feel graceful        529    00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.880    themselves to lead with Grace is to        530    00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.120    recognize that true leadership is not        531    00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.400    about you let me say that again to lead        532    00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.200    with Grace is to recognize that true        533    00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.200    leadership is not about you it's about        534    00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.880    creating the conditions and        535    00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.760    opportunities for others to be their        536    00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.960    graceful best whether they are your        537    00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.240    students your children or your        538    00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.360    colleagues Grace is also about style        539    00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.320    this may seem superficial at first but        540    00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.720    style matters and it's inevitable every        541    00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.400    leader has a style whether that leader        542    00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.760    is a parent a teacher a principal or a        543    00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.159    CEO to lead with Grace is to lead with a        544    00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:25.360    style that is true to who you are when I        545    00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.919    was a law student at the University of        546    00:23:26.919 --> 00:23:28.760    Virginia our peer adviser gave us        547    00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.080    memorable advice about how to handle job        548    00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.520    interviews he told us just be yourself        549    00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.799    unless of course you are a jerk in which        550    00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:39.600    case be somebody        551    00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.720    else that might work for an interview        552    00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.559    but trying to be someone else won't work        553    00:23:44.559 --> 00:23:46.600    when you're a leader to lead with Grace        554    00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.919    you have to be at ease with yourself and        555    00:23:48.919 --> 00:23:50.799    you can't be at ease with yourself if        556    00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:53.200    you're trying to be someone else one        557    00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.080    last point which is really two but I'm        558    00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.400    sure you're getting tired so I'll        559    00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.440    combine them into one to me Grace is        560    00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.080    where confidence and humility        561    00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.159    intersect this is what I saw when I        562    00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:06.919    watched Dr Jay who was confident but        563    00:24:06.919 --> 00:24:10.840    quietly so most truly graceful athletes        564    00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.400    dancers and        565    00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.840    musicians obviously possess confidence        566    00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.640    in their abilities but they also exude        567    00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.520    humility they seem to appreciate the        568    00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.960    natural gifts bestowed upon them but        569    00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.279    also recognize perhaps because they are        570    00:24:26.279 --> 00:24:29.200    so close to perfect that per ction is        571    00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.640    impossible to lead with Grace is to lead        572    00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.799    with this combination of confidence and        573    00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:38.720    humility confidence in your ability but        574    00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.679    enough humility to recognize that you        575    00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:43.360    may be gifted but you will never be        576    00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.600    perfect gratitude courage and        577    00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.039    forgiveness service to others        578    00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:49.720    authenticity and confidence and humility        579    00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.000    admittedly that's a lot to remember and        580    00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.440    I recognize that graduation speeches are        581    00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.080    often forgotten so let me end by        582    00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.799    suggesting that you remember just one        583    00:24:58.799 --> 00:25:02.320    word from this speech grace even if you        584    00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.159    don't instantly remember all that this        585    00:25:04.159 --> 00:25:06.720    word means I'm confident that if you        586    00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.159    remember Grace it will help you find the        587    00:25:09.159 --> 00:25:12.360    right path you all possess Grace in your        588    00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.720    own way you are both graceful and        589    00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.399    gracious I not only believe that I've        590    00:25:18.399 --> 00:25:21.919    seen evidence of it all year Embrace        591    00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:25.320    Your Grace cultivate it and share it        592    00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.559    with the world which desperately needs        593    00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:32.720    it in short and In Sum not to mention in        594    00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.559    rhyme as you depart aan way to make the        595    00:25:35.559 --> 00:25:38.440    world a better place may you always        596    00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:43.720    always lead with Grace thank you

Kerry left the Senate to        81    00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.160    become US Secretary of State under        82    00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.260    President Barack Obama in January 2013        83    00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.220    during his tenure at the State        84    00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.440    Department secretary Kerry was a highly        85    00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.290    respected global leader on a wide range        86    00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.209    of issues including nuclear        87    00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.080    proliferation radical extremism climate        88    00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.739    change and humanitarian crises I will        89    00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.720    mention just three of the many topics on        90    00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.239    which he worked one was the terrible        91    00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.840    conflict in Syria by August of 2013 the        92    00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.550    world had learned that the Syrian        93    00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.080    government had used chemical weapons        94    00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.500    against its own people secretary Kerry        95    00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.200    said quote the indiscriminate slaughter        96    00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.020    of civilians the killing of women and        97    00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.600    children and innocent bystanders by        98    00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.680    chemical weapons is a moral obscenity        99    00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.050    unquote eventually the US Russia and        100    00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.450    other nations tried to develop a plan        101    00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.520    whereby Syria would destroy its        102    00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.400    remaining chemical weapons        103    00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.930    unfortunately that plan did not fully        104    00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.360    resolve the situation        105    00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.050    that we now see another major issue for        106    00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.060    secretary Kerry was negotiations with        107    00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.099    Iran to halt their nuclear weapons        108    00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:05.590    development and as we well know after        109    00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.020    extensive talks over several years Iran        110    00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.750    the United States and other nations        111    00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.310    reached an agreement under which Iran        112    00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.590    stopped its uranium enrichment efforts        113    00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.259    in exchange for the removal of sanctions        114    00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:19.780    and the third crucial area where        115    00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.400    secretary Kerry devoted a great deal of        116    00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.560    effort was environmental issues and        117    00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.409    particularly climate change in April        118    00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.310    2016 he signed the Paris

strength of the human        184    00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.090    spirit I was very proud when we were        185    00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.860    able to bring them back from Iran there        186    00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.600    others still there but Jason welcome        187    00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:09.270    we're delighted to have you here so look        188    00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.520    I'll let me be honest about it when it        189    00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.560    was first reported that a Yale grad was        190    00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.850    going to be speaking at Harvard's        191    00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.970    Kennedy School the initial reaction was        192    00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:23.460    fake news but notwithstanding my Yale        193    00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.670    background the Dean was very very        194    00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.470    generous he offered to reimburse me for        195    00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:34.080    half of my uber ride now some people        196    00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.560    have asked me why would I even venture        197    00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.110    into the belly of the beast        198    00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:42.510    well I represented it for 28 plus years        199    00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.000    in the Senate but the answer is really        200    00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.120    very simple folks I came here to see if        201    00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.280    I can negotiate an end to the        202    00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.840    construction at the Kennedy School        203    00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.149    I understand it's it's going to be        204    00:10:01.149 --> 00:10:05.500    finished in 2030 anyway I want you to        205    00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.850    know that it is hard to suddenly just        206    00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.449    stop negotiating as Secretary of State        207    00:10:12.449 --> 00:10:15.160    and my friends have been busy trying to        208    00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.170    buck me up they assure me that I can        209    00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.510    still be called on to help negotiate        210    00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.870    peace after all there are so many        211    00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.880    warring factions out there        212    00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.560    Red Sox and Yankee fans Sean Spicer in        213    00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.070    the press and Ann Coulter and Berkeley        214    00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:37.060    so there's work to be done obviously but        215    00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.300    I should tell you there are plenty of        216    00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.120    things about government that I actually        217    00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.380    don't miss but I have one regret it's        218    00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.959    that alec baldwin never did an        219    00:10:49.959 --> 00:10:54.040    impersonation of me let alone melissa        220    00:10:54.040 --> 00:11:00.339    mccarthy which would be interesting I'm        221    00:11:00.339 --> 00:11:02.949    often asked what the secret is and I was        222    00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:04.630    just up at a luncheon and we were having        223    00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.510    some conversation about government and        224    00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.069    I've been asked what is the secret to        225    00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:12.639    having a real impact on government well        226    00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:14.260    it's recently changed        227    00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.199    I used to say either run for office or        228    00:11:17.199 --> 00:11:18.519    get a degree from the Harvard Kennedy        229    00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:22.149    School with this White House I'd say buy        230    00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:27.990    rosetta stone and learn Russian but        231    00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:34.240    [Applause]        232    00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.570    listen don't don't get upset at me folks        233    00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.490    opportunities have never been better for        234    00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.100    Kennedy school grads just think there        235    00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.350    are thousands of jobs open in the Trump        236    00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:47.560    administration anybody here want to be        237    00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:56.500    Attorney General now I think he'd be        238    00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:01.050    disqualified by being here I've been        239    00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.850    I've been privileged to speak at a few        240    00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.600    commencements since I was elected to the        241    00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.670    United States Senate in 1984 and the        242    00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.380    intervening years have taught me to        243    00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.100    approach this task with humility there's        244    00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.980    a lot to talk about but there is a        245    00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.720    reason that they say that the mind can        246    00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.740    only absorb what the seat can endure so        247    00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:30.580    I decided to keep this short in true        248    00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.420    Senate tradition I promise not to be one        249    00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:39.279    minute over four hours now I'm really        250    00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:40.990    going to try to be brief but I do want        251    00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.850    to summarize a lot I want to talk to you        252    00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:48.760    I did not come here to be partisan or        253    00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:53.560    political or pessimistic but I need to        254    00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.760    tell the truth and together we all need        255    00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.970    to start acting on it the worst thing        256    00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.320    that I could do is insult your        257    00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.029    intelligence by pretending that it's        258    00:13:04.029 --> 00:13:06.339    just smooth sailing for America and for        259    00:13:06.339 --> 00:13:08.649    the world and I refuse to        260    00:13:08.649 --> 00:13:11.470    self-consciously twist myself into a        261    00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.950    pretzel and put on a contrived mantle of        262    00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.440    bipartisanship that alleges that both        263    00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.329    parties are to blame for what's going on        264    00:13:19.329 --> 00:13:23.310    or not going on as the case may be and        265    00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:26.890    anyway you wouldn't buy it since so many        266    00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.740    of you have marched and protested in        267    00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.720    order to take a public stand on your own        268    00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.020    so let's get the here-and-now out of the        269    00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.260    way because it's really only a sliver of        270    00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.579    what I want to share with you today        271    00:13:44.579 --> 00:13:47.230    distinct from the hurly-burly of any        272    00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.100    presidential        273    00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.120    visit my travel to our Asia to the        274    00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.310    Middle East Europe in these past few        275    00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.459    months has informed me that the global        276    00:13:57.459 --> 00:13:59.639    community is watching and unsettled        277    00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:02.110    about the leading nation in the free        278    00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.430    world they see us gridlocked and        279    00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.870    politically trapped in a low-intensity        280    00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.319    internal conflict of our own they see us        281    00:14:11.319 --> 00:14:13.540    unilaterally disarming in the battle of        282    00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.170    values they see us walking away from a        283    00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:19.449    century of thoughtful carefully        284    00:14:19.449 --> 00:14:21.730    conceived economic and strategic        285    00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:25.509    leadership they see a volatility and        286    00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:28.709    unpredictability that creates confusion        287    00:14:28.709 --> 00:14:31.269    they see a budget proposal that        288    00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:34.329    eviscerates diplomacy and reduces        289    00:14:34.329 --> 00:14:35.920    America's engagement which has        290    00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.889    traditionally defined our leadership in        291    00:14:38.889 --> 00:14:42.970    the world and in this last year our        292    00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:46.300    discourse if you can dare to call it        293    00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.149    that rose to a new level of the        294    00:14:49.149 --> 00:14:52.380    outrageous the course and the ugly the        295    00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.509    public dialogue has become no dialogue        296    00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:56.790    at all        297    00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.470    it's a shouting match alienating        298    00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.569    citizens who desperately yearn for more        299    00:15:01.569 --> 00:15:05.290    from their leaders we seem trapped in a        300    00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:07.959    political pinball machine where we        301    00:15:07.959 --> 00:15:10.600    Kareem from flipper to flipper bouncing        302    00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.319    off walls of insults and contradictions        303    00:15:13.319 --> 00:15:17.050    outright lies and broken promises where        304    00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.990    up is down and words don't mean anything        305    00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:21.899    anymore        306    00:15:21.899 --> 00:15:25.509    but democracy relies on free speech yes        307    00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:29.230    say anything you want but it relies even        308    00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:33.130    more on the speech being truthful it is        309    00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.420    the truth after all        310    00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.380    that sets us free        311    00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.470    and the truth is no this is not a normal        312    00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:51.339    time it's not normal to see a president        313    00:15:51.339 --> 00:15:55.019    United States decrying so-called judges        314    00:15:55.019 --> 00:15:57.580    it's not normal for the leader of the        315    00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.080    country that invented the First        316    00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.380    Amendment to routinely degrade and even        317    00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.440    threaten journalists and no it's not        318    00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.720    normal to see the head of the FBI fired        319    00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.209    summarily because he was investigating        320    00:16:10.209 --> 00:16:11.850    connections between Russia and the        321    00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:14.110    presidential campaign of the very man        322    00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.620    who fired him and it's not normal that        323    00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.959    when you close your eyes and you listen        324    00:16:19.959 --> 00:16:22.600    to the news too often the political        325    00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.480    back-and-forth in America sounds too        326    00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.100    much like it does in the kinds of        327    00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.620    countries that the State Department        328    00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:33.430    warns Americans not to travel to know        329    00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.339    there is nothing normal about this        330    00:16:36.339 --> 00:16:40.600    moment my friends and in the end there        331    00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.990    is nothing American about it either now        332    00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.610    many of you say you've never seen        333    00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.260    anything like this in your lives and        334    00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.720    you're right but I'm old enough to have        335    00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.970    seen a movie like this maybe a time or        336    00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.940    two and that's why about this part of        337    00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.829    the story at least I'm actually more of        338    00:16:56.829 --> 00:17:00.600    an optimist I grew up a cold war child        339    00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.240    my dad was stationed in Washington DC at        340    00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.720    the State Department in the 1950s I        341    00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.309    remember watching the army McCarthy        342    00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:10.270    hearings        343    00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.870    I remember the hysteria but I also        344    00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:15.880    remember that eventually people in both        345    00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.860    parties and people who could care less        346    00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:21.160    about party label stood up and said        347    00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.300    enough this isn't America and Joe        348    00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.200    McCarthy was censured 12 years later I        349    00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.570    graduated from college joined the Navy        350    00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.240    served in Vietnam and was lucky enough        351    00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.860    to come home alive        352    00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:40.480    to a country at war with itself it was a        353    00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.390    time of division people were attacked        354    00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.910    for speaking their minds there was a        355    00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.300    near constitutional crisis Richard Nixon        356    00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.270    took me on personally and that was my        357    00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:56.169    first dose of fake news I watched        358    00:17:56.169 --> 00:17:56.950    Watergate        359    00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.840    little black-and-white television screen        360    00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.500    but somehow the inherent strength of our        361    00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.170    Constitution and the courage of        362    00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.950    individual senators regardless of party        363    00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.750    empowered America to find its way out of        364    00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.510    what President Ford called a national        365    00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:18.910    nightmare and in 1974 a whole new wave        366    00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.490    of people were elected to Congress to        367    00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:24.040    clean up the corruption and put the        368    00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.550    country back on course I relive that        369    00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:30.070    history not to predict that that's the        370    00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.770    path were on again but to share with you        371    00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:36.010    that in my experience the institution's        372    00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.980    the founders created to hold America        373    00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.040    together have always worked best when        374    00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.190    America needed them the most only one        375    00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:46.930    time in our history was there an        376    00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:49.570    exception and that was for a cause that        377    00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.750    Abraham Lincoln himself said could only        378    00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.990    be resolved when quote the blood drawn        379    00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.990    with the lash shall be paid with another        380    00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:02.650    drawn with the sword you know what I        381    00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.900    don't think even Andrew Jackson could        382    00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.920    have stopped that one so with respect to        383    00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:13.390    the short term and this important with        384    00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:16.990    respect to the short term the things        385    00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.580    that we're all talking about and        386    00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.060    fighting over every day count me an        387    00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:25.390    optimist because I believe that America        388    00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.850    has got a pretty good almost 241 year        389    00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.190    record of turning difficult situations        390    00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:34.330    into progress but it's the long term we        391    00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.120    need to focus on and that's what I want        392    00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.550    to focus on today because we have to        393    00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.590    focus on it with a special purpose that        394    00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:44.560    is completely absent in today's politics        395    00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.220    a focus deprived all the oxygen by the        396    00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.800    daily forest fires that were forced to        397    00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.850    fight because while we're stuck        398    00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.680    disproving the crazy proposition that        399    00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.640    two plus two equals five while we're        400    00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.550    fighting just to hold on to truths long        401    00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:08.740    ago decided far more is at stake and we        402    00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.460    aren't even scratching the surface        403    00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:15.130    it's in the struggle for the future that        404    00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:18.040    you graduates need to put your energy in        405    00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.340    your idealism its the challenges that we        406    00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.710    aren't confronting the issues that we        407    00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:26.110    aren't facing the questions that leaders        408    00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:28.480    aren't even asking where we need to        409    00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.670    shake the free world out of its slumber        410    00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:33.190    and wrestle with what is really coming        411    00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.950    at us it's going to take people with        412    00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:39.310    courage and guts to stand up and tell        413    00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:42.150    the truth and put forward better choices        414    00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:46.020    not lowest-common-denominator choices        415    00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.730    calculated to win votes by provoking        416    00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.630    anger and building resentment the fact        417    00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.250    is that we're not organizing ourselves        418    00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.290    to deal with the mail desert challenges        419    00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:58.960    that are going to define our time much        420    00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.200    of the world is now riding a wave of        421    00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.120    technological transformation on the        422    00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.390    scale of the Industrial Revolution but        423    00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:11.080    it's happening at a digital pace in        424    00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.320    country after country ideas are moving        425    00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.960    faster people are moving faster the        426    00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.660    marketplace is moving faster the only        427    00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.280    thing that isn't moving faster and        428    00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.210    faster is the ability of governance        429    00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:28.690    worldwide to respond in the midst of        430    00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.870    this tectonic shift in the workplace too        431    00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.560    many people have been left behind and        432    00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.350    that's a choice that people in positions        433    00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.410    of power have actually been content to        434    00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.710    accept I'm not surprised that a lot of        435    00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:48.000    folks want to stop the world and get off        436    00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.930    many people who were hurt in 2008 from        437    00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:55.840    the economic implosion are still feeling        438    00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.930    pain and why wouldn't they here in the        439    00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.490    United States your average family        440    00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.650    suddenly found their home worth half its        441    00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:05.140    value but they were still stuck with a        442    00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.170    hundred percent of the mortgage that's a        443    00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.450    pretty simple recipe for a lot of anger        444    00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:13.510    that and the fact that despite working        445    00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:17.040    harder sometimes maybe two or three jobs        446    00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:22.060    people still don't get ahead trade has        447    00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.630    become a target        448    00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:26.630    but here again politicians are        449    00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:29.510    exploiting rather than leading it's        450    00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:32.450    technology not trade that is the        451    00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:34.700    principal reason we lost 85 percent of        452    00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.970    the 5.6 million jobs manufacturing jobs        453    00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.010    hemorrhaged in the first 10 years of        454    00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.980    this century yes        455    00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.430    technology is transformative but if it        456    00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:48.670    was your job that was disrupted and        457    00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:52.520    nothing replaced it guess what you would        458    00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.920    find zero comfort in the fact that some        459    00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.560    technology that stole your job also gave        460    00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.810    you a smartphone that lets you binge        461    00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:02.060    watch your future that's out of reach        462    00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:05.560    for you and everybody you grew up with        463    00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.030    it's hard enough that we haven't yet        464    00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.130    solved the job crisis of West Virginia        465    00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:13.040    and parts of Ohio but if that's a        466    00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.430    challenge take a look at what's coming        467    00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.460    around the bend it'll make the Rust Belt        468    00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.900    look like child's play        469    00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.019    [Music]        470    00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:33.450    we've talked a lot and we should about a        471    00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:36.150    million coal mining jobs gone in 20        472    00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.000    years but did you miss the report last        473    00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.750    week that retail jobs dropped almost in        474    00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:46.740    half in the last 15 years we lost more        475    00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.620    total department store workers than coal        476    00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:55.230    miners why technology and what concerns        477    00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.630    me is that if our institutions can't        478    00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:00.450    build consensus and respond to the        479    00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.760    demand of Americans for jobs today how        480    00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.170    are we ever going to do it in a time        481    00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:06.300    when artificial intelligence and        482    00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.660    robotics kick in five times that number        483    00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:14.250    of jobs disappear twice as fast and it's        484    00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:20.790    not just us caught in this paradox there        485    00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:22.980    was a fascinating and revealing moment        486    00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.980    in France just two weeks ago the Neo        487    00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.890    populist marine lepen visited a factory        488    00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:31.500    and she promised to bring back jobs that        489    00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.350    every economist knew weren't ever coming        490    00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:35.420    back        491    00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.900    McCrone visited hours later and he told        492    00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.970    those workers that he couldn't bring        493    00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:45.960    back their jobs she was a demagogue he        494    00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:50.010    told the truth and he won but how long        495    00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:53.690    can you hold a society        496    00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.650    but I want to ask you how long you can        497    00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:04.680    hold together a society on hard truths        498    00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:08.460    alone when what people need is to know        499    00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.800    that in return for hard work in a job        500    00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.810    that they had 10 years ago not in that        501    00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:17.130    job but in a job now today that they can        502    00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:18.780    actually take care of their family and        503    00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:22.020    have the pride and dignity of work and        504    00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.060    being a full participant in their        505    00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:27.120    society in the halls of the Kennedy        506    00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.370    School you've had the debate about what        507    00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:32.330    happens to the fabric of our societies        508    00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.830    but in the halls of Congress in the        509    00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:36.480    White House where they should do        510    00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.820    something about it there is a dangerous        511    00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.730    deadlock that willful denial and most        512    00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:45.390    egregious rhetorical lip service that        513    00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:48.900    instead of producing jobs is destined to        514    00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.920    create even greater anger nowhere is        515    00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.480    that denial more dangerous or        516    00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.630    economically costly than the absence of        517    00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:00.270    concerted effort to correct the perilous        518    00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:02.790    course that our planet has been on for        519    00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:05.820    far too long for the last few weeks        520    00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.860    we've all heard the debate watch the        521    00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.560    news a lot of sound bites about whether        522    00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.940    the United States is going to win        523    00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:15.120    Bandhan nearly 200 other countries and        524    00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.510    we unilaterally withdraw from the Paris        525    00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:22.950    agreement make no mistake if the United        526    00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:25.530    States unilaterally retreated from our        527    00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:27.720    commitments made as a leader in the        528    00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.940    negotiations it would have enormous        529    00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.550    negative reverberations around the        530    00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:36.480    equator and from pole to pole believe me        531    00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.870    it would be a self-inflicted wound that        532    00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:42.570    will hurt our own businesses diminish        533    00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:46.880    our leadership and setback our future I        534    00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.100    spent Election Day 2016 headed to        535    00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:54.000    Antarctica by way of New Zealand and yes        536    00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.100    when I saw the results I admit for a        537    00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.300    couple of minutes I thought about        538    00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:02.550    staying so there I was at ground zero        539    00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:06.170    for climate change McMurdo Station        540    00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.310    sitting with scientists from all over        541    00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.340    the world not American not ideological        542    00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.100    not        543    00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.740    members of any political party people        544    00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:18.100    whose life is based on looking at        545    00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.130    evidence working a pedagogy finding out        546    00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:23.950    the truth determining what are facts and        547    00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:27.100    they pulled out chart after chart and        548    00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.890    they described the latest deeply        549    00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:32.169    alarming evidence of what is happening        550    00:27:32.169 --> 00:27:33.370    to our planet        551    00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:36.309    I flew by helicopter over the West        552    00:27:36.309 --> 00:27:38.620    Antarctic Ice Sheet sometimes as much as        553    00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:41.620    three miles deep I walked out onto the        554    00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:45.370    Rashi ice shelf and I I looked out at        555    00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:46.780    the ocean and I talked to the        556    00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.980    researchers who didn't mince words a        557    00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.240    scientist from New Zealand named Gavin        558    00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.669    Dunbar describe what they're seeing        559    00:27:54.669 --> 00:27:57.130    there as an unmistakable canary in the        560    00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:58.289    coal mine        561    00:27:58.289 --> 00:28:02.799    he warned quote some thresholds if we        562    00:28:02.799 --> 00:28:08.169    cross them can never be reversed and        563    00:28:08.169 --> 00:28:09.940    just a few days ago the New York Times        564    00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.549    confirmed our worst fears that        565    00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:15.240    Antarctica's ice sheet may be facing        566    00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.280    unstoppable disintegration with warm        567    00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.500    water the the weight of the ice pushes        568    00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.809    the continent down warmer water now        569    00:28:22.809 --> 00:28:24.940    comes in under the ice as well as the        570    00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.740    melting on top and you have an        571    00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.690    instability that is building up as a        572    00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:31.860    consequence year or two ago a whole        573    00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.390    piece of the ice sheet broke off the        574    00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:36.520    Larsen Ice Sheet the size of the state        575    00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.940    of Rhode Island so the challenge that        576    00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:44.200    science puts to us is enormous but even        577    00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.030    here I believe that if we make the right        578    00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:49.320    choices we don't have to be pessimistic        579    00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.690    the solution to climate change is energy        580    00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:56.080    policy and we have the energy solutions        581    00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.409    already determined I don't buy that we        582    00:28:59.409 --> 00:29:01.960    have to be pessimistic because America's        583    00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.059    domestic politics are divided now and        584    00:29:04.059 --> 00:29:05.740    somehow we're stuck in neutral or even        585    00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:09.610    reverse on environmental progress I'll        586    00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:12.250    tell you why I'm not pessimistic because        587    00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.440    I believe the world has already made a        588    00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.919    different bet a bet on science a bet        589    00:29:17.919 --> 00:29:20.679    unreality and a bet that we have to move        590    00:29:20.679 --> 00:29:23.740    forward with or without America's        591    00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.220    political leaders        592    00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.320    now of course that also means that the        593    00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.080    actions that we take together outside of        594    00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.760    government working in partnership with        595    00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.190    other countries are much more important        596    00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:36.410    that they were before November 6th        597    00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:39.670    I believe we're just getting started        598    00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:43.340    because the science gives us no other        599    00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.920    choice and because the world certainly        600    00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.730    on climate change the marketplace has        601    00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:54.080    made its choice already the clean energy        602    00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.400    industry now as we sit here today        603    00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.980    employs nearly five times as many        604    00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.790    Americans as the fossil fuel industry        605    00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:07.220    last year roughly twice as much was        606    00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.460    invested in renewables capacity        607    00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.380    worldwide than in fossil fuel generation        608    00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:17.180    and solar and wind gobs are growing 12        609    00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:20.060    times faster than the rest of America's        610    00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:24.100    economy the world        611    00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.660    the world has now collectively truly one        612    00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:36.260    to begun to move towards a clean energy        613    00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:39.530    future that's why I really don't get        614    00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:41.840    excessively agitated when I hear        615    00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.280    politicians say that they're going to        616    00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:47.270    bring back Kol I disagree with it it's        617    00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:50.930    short-sighted it would be dangerous but        618    00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:54.559    guess what it's impossible because the        619    00:30:54.559 --> 00:30:57.600    market has already decided otherwise        620    00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.650    [Applause]        621    00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:04.100    and the question at this point is not        622    00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:07.280    whether or not we will get to the global        623    00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.679    low-carbon economy that we need to get        624    00:31:09.679 --> 00:31:13.970    to we're going to get there we will the        625    00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:16.280    question is whether we're going to do it        626    00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.160    fast enough to prevent the worst of what        627    00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.710    the changing climate could inflict on        628    00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:24.559    every single corner of the world the        629    00:31:24.559 --> 00:31:26.660    question is whether we will continue to        630    00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.450    pursue solutions together and reap the        631    00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:32.120    enormous economic benefits of the        632    00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:35.679    largest market the world has ever seen        633    00:31:35.679 --> 00:31:40.880    four to five billion users today a multi        634    00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.429    trillion dollar market and going up to        635    00:31:43.429 --> 00:31:45.559    nine billion users by the middle of the        636    00:31:45.559 --> 00:31:50.410    century in most countries leaders are        637    00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:53.960    seeing and seizing the opportunities        638    00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.940    that are coming as a result of this the        639    00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.940    Indian government is advancing plans to        640    00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.970    install 100 gigawatts of solar capacity        641    00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:06.590    by 2020 President Xi of China recently        642    00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:09.050    announced a 361 billion dollar        643    00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:10.880    investment in clean energy        644    00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.970    no wonder US oil and gas companies want        645    00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:16.300    to stick with the Paris agreement        646    00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.620    because it's good for their bottom line        647    00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:22.130    and a president who spent a long career        648    00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:23.290    in business        649    00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:25.760    surrounded by cabinet secretaries who        650    00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.000    headed for toon 500 companies ought to        651    00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.150    be persuaded by the rationality of these        652    00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:35.360    arguments and I hope that every single        653    00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.250    one of you here who has the ability to        654    00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:41.430    join the army of persuaders will do so        655    00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:44.960    the day before yesterday        656    00:32:51.809 --> 00:32:55.720    just one quick add-on to that at lunch        657    00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.640    today we were talking and I mentioned I        658    00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.350    was asked something about how you        659    00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:01.990    measure things in in in in making        660    00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:04.050    decisions about these kinds of things        661    00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:05.920    you know it's really a matter of        662    00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.390    fundamental common-sense and        663    00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:08.920    responsibility if you're a public person        664    00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.200    you have to take the data you have and        665    00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.000    make the best judgments you can about        666    00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.700    what your choices are well if you have        667    00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.580    most of the scientists of the world 97%        668    00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:22.120    of them with peer-reviewed studies more        669    00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:26.800    than 6,000 of them telling you what what        670    00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.650    will happen if you make these measures        671    00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:34.090    you'll have cleaner air we have 55        672    00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:35.920    billion dollars we spend every year        673    00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.330    because the biggest cause of children        674    00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:40.530    being hospitalized in the summer is        675    00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:43.600    environmentally induced asthma cost you        676    00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.390    fifty five billion a year last year we        677    00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:47.830    spent twenty seven billion dollars        678    00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:50.650    cleaning up after ten major storms        679    00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:53.380    unlike any storms we'd seen before we        680    00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.510    have five hundred year floods every five        681    00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:58.510    years now the evidence tells us        682    00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:01.090    something and as public people our job        683    00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:04.300    is to reduce risk to minimize the        684    00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.730    negative impacts if you're weighing this        685    00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:09.220    folks it seems pretty clear to me that        686    00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:12.300    creating more jobs if creating more jobs        687    00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:15.190    reducing bad air living up to our        688    00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:17.169    environmental responsibilities being        689    00:34:17.169 --> 00:34:19.480    energy independent creating sustainable        690    00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.669    energy is the worst that will happen if        691    00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:24.639    we make the choice we take but if Al        692    00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:26.740    Gore John Kerry and Ban ki-moon the        693    00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:29.169    bunch of people are wrong and the        694    00:34:29.169 --> 00:34:32.889    deniers are right doesn't matter but it        695    00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:38.620    happens anyway guess what disaster life        696    00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.740    on Earth as we know it would be over        697    00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:43.600    fifty more than 50% of the oxygen we        698    00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.340    breathe comes out of the oceans the        699    00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.409    oceans are increasingly acidified        700    00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:49.060    because of the carbon dioxide that goes        701    00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:52.740    into them so on a simple rate of        702    00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:57.910    downsides common sense says make the        703    00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:00.880    choice to do what you need to do now        704    00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.440    there's another challenge that we're        705    00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.720    had the day before yesterday reinforced        706    00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.790    in all of us the need for yet another        707    00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:11.109    better focus of our energies the brazen        708    00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:13.390    attack in Manchester England is        709    00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:16.240    devastating it should shake and anger        710    00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:20.130    people everywhere but let's be clear        711    00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:22.780    we've spent more time debating what to        712    00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.900    call extremism then we have discussing a        713    00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.200    real strategy as to how you beat it and        714    00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:34.329    again if we if we don't deal with the        715    00:35:34.329 --> 00:35:37.569    long term here I promise you every four        716    00:35:37.569 --> 00:35:40.119    years a different president and a        717    00:35:40.119 --> 00:35:41.740    different Foreign Minister will be        718    00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.480    facing a different terror group with a        719    00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:46.869    different acronym it's all well and good        720    00:35:46.869 --> 00:35:48.670    to call on Arab nations to rid        721    00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:52.270    themselves of extremism they should but        722    00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:54.760    just infusing more weapons into the Gulf        723    00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.280    states is not going to solve the problem        724    00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.530    of a region that needs to create more        725    00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:02.020    than 60 million new jobs in the next        726    00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:05.050    decade alone just to keep pace with the        727    00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:06.790    number of young people entering the        728    00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:08.450    workforce        729    00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:12.660    [Applause]        730    00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.820    in too many parts of the world today        731    00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.070    northern Africa the Middle East parts of        732    00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:19.830    Asia there are countries in which sixty        733    00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:22.070    to sixty-five percent of the nation is        734    00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:25.320    under the age of thirty countries in        735    00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.180    which fifty percent the nation's under        736    00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:30.480    the age of eighteen and the larger        737    00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.410    vision of that need not everyone wants        738    00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:37.620    to confront it is to provide these        739    00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:40.320    booming youth populations with a quality        740    00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.600    education with skills for the modern        741    00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.760    world with jobs that allow them to        742    00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:48.600    actually build a life and build        743    00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.570    confidence in their own countries so the        744    00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:52.920    question is how we going to deal with        745    00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.770    this challenge when I was secretary I        746    00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:57.480    dinner with a foreign minister in an        747    00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.300    African country a friend of mine respect        748    00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.830    him greatly and he will continue to be        749    00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:04.170    in public life and I asked him how are        750    00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.660    you managing the true the challenge of        751    00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.870    extremism and he confided in me that he        752    00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:13.470    was genuinely worried frightened because        753    00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:16.650    he said extremists lure young kids away        754    00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.570    from their families and away from        755    00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:20.820    poverty and they pay them the small        756    00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.850    stipend and then they proselytized and        757    00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:26.790    after a period of time those kids didn't        758    00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:29.580    need to be paid they were fully enlisted        759    00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.100    they were the next wave going out of        760    00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.980    recruit secret roots this foreign        761    00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.110    minister smart man said to me with deep        762    00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:40.410    frustration extremists have a thirty        763    00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:43.350    five-year plan that they pursue with        764    00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.690    dedication we don't even have a        765    00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:49.560    five-year plan I thought about that the        766    00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.630    context of the Western world and all of        767    00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:55.380    the developed nations back when some of        768    00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.350    us were children and our planet was        769    00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.090    emerging from the darkness of World War        770    00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:04.500    two America switched the light on called        771    00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:08.970    the Marshall Plan between 1948 1951 the        772    00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:11.540    United States invested between 12 and 13        773    00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.580    billion dollars in the recovery of        774    00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:17.490    Europe now that may not sound like a lot        775    00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:20.880    to your ears in 2017 but it was the        776    00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.130    equivalent of about 120 billion dollars        777    00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:26.070    in today's dollars after World        778    00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:28.290    we were bringing countries back from        779    00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:31.920    already existing industrial bases in        780    00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:35.580    many cases today we're starting from        781    00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:40.170    scratch but we're not starting and why        782    00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:43.410    should we care because we have no other        783    00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:44.070    choice        784    00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:46.830    you heard the famous World War 1 song        785    00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:50.010    over there well today over there is        786    00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:54.330    everywhere travel trade education smart        787    00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.570    phones communications people everywhere        788    00:38:57.570 --> 00:38:59.720    are in touch with everywhere and        789    00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.790    everywhere people know what everyone        790    00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:06.150    else has which means they also have        791    00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:10.440    underscored what they don't have America        792    00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.230    cannot suddenly opt out of a networked        793    00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:16.080    world and pretend that it can get by        794    00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.230    with a zero-sum policy in which the most        795    00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:21.210    powerful economy in the world is the        796    00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:25.020    winner to succeed in an already        797    00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.780    globalized world my friends in a super        798    00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.950    connected world all of us have to opt in        799    00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:33.410    everyone has to win        800    00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:35.700    surely a country that is willing to        801    00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.520    spend trillions of dollars which we have        802    00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.850    spent you have spent American citizens        803    00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:45.900    in the last 10-15 years to battle        804    00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.270    extremism in Afghanistan Iraq Syria        805    00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:51.600    Libya surely we can prove it we can        806    00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:56.820    begin to prevent tomorrow's extremism by        807    00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.070    offering young people the promise of        808    00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:02.610    modernity and good governance not the        809    00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:06.030    destruction of strapping on a suicide        810    00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:08.340    vest and blowing yourself up and a whole        811    00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.830    bunch of innocent people and taking them        812    00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:11.760    to kingdom come        813    00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.790    that's the choice so how are we going to        814    00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:17.730    do it I don't want to just put out a big        815    00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:21.180    idea I want to share with you how we can        816    00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:25.410    do this what we need is not a Marshall        817    00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:28.290    Plan for the 20th century what we need        818    00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:30.980    is a new plan for the 21st century a        819    00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:34.020    plan that starts by recognizing the        820    00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.510    reality that no one government in the        821    00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:37.720    world has        822    00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.490    the ability to move far enough fast        823    00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:43.119    enough alone we need to meet today's        824    00:40:43.119 --> 00:40:45.130    development challenges with the same        825    00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.830    determination that characterized the        826    00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:51.160    original Marshall Plan but this time a        827    00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:56.349    plan that is fakest focused on not        828    00:40:56.349 --> 00:41:00.099    bypassing developing countries there is        829    00:41:00.099 --> 00:41:03.910    no other way to achieve genuine peace in        830    00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:07.710    the world and that's where you come in        831    00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:10.390    we've talked a lot about public-private        832    00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:12.790    partnership the challenge for your        833    00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:15.820    generation graduates is to harness the        834    00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.820    full energy of that partnership working        835    00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:21.369    with the World Bank and other        836    00:41:21.369 --> 00:41:24.240    international financial institutions I        837    00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.710    envision a truly global and        838    00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:29.290    forward-looking initiative that would        839    00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:33.130    bring off of the sidelines some of the        840    00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:36.960    twelve to thirteen trillion dollars now        841    00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:40.240    sitting in net negative interest rate        842    00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:46.200    status around the world combining forces        843    00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.490    government's investment funds        844    00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:50.760    international financial institutions        845    00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.290    philanthropies and the most powerful        846    00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:55.990    economies in the world can join together        847    00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:58.900    to do more to facilitate investment into        848    00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:01.440    education health care clean energy        849    00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:04.330    connectivity and infrastructure of all        850    00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:07.540    kinds we can build out in countries that        851    00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.670    have never seen a build out and make a        852    00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:11.410    difference in the lives of those young        853    00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:13.780    people and that kind of coordinated        854    00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.480    approach can help create the confidence        855    00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.940    that is necessary to produce a        856    00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:21.670    legitimate long-term return on        857    00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:24.490    investment now one of the ways that we        858    00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:26.589    can leverage this is to build a        859    00:42:26.589 --> 00:42:28.450    partnership between developed and near        860    00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:31.180    developed countries in mind ago she        861    00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:34.210    ations with China the leaders agreed        862    00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:36.010    that it would be groundbreaking and        863    00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:38.859    important if our two governments were to        864    00:42:38.859 --> 00:42:41.410    cooperate on development projects and        865    00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:45.369    they agreed to do so I welcome the Asia        866    00:42:45.369 --> 00:42:48.490    infrastructure investment bank I see it        867    00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:50.080    as a critical part of this kind of        868    00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:50.710    initiative        869    00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:53.320    and I believe that building on our        870    00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.690    partnership in the climate negotiations        871    00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:58.570    we should urgently follow up with the        872    00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:01.750    Chinese now to leverage sustainable        873    00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:04.480    investment on a global basis through its        874    00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.390    belt and road initiative and well beyond        875    00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:09.730    and that will make a difference unlike        876    00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:11.860    any difference we made in the last        877    00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:14.380    quarter century on this planet now we        878    00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:21.750    also know we also know that capital        879    00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:25.000    chases confidence money behaves in        880    00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.520    predictable ways it wants the fastest        881    00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.140    return on investment or it wants the        882    00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.020    safest return on investment or somewhere        883    00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:36.550    in the middle we know how it works we        884    00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:38.500    can grow confidence and we can make        885    00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.410    deals commercially viable by bringing        886    00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:45.040    philanthropies to the table as well as        887    00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.950    build on the china-us cooperation in        888    00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:50.260    order to reduce political and financial        889    00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:54.190    risks which often deter capital        890    00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:57.310    allocation and by agreeing on standards        891    00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:59.650    internationally the plan would require        892    00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:01.720    greater transparency and accountability        893    00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.300    from developing countries it would help        894    00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:06.760    us reduce the levels of corruption which        895    00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.760    in itself will attract more capital and        896    00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.040    believe me when countries like the        897    00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.320    United States and China and India start        898    00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.420    to leverage these investments to        899    00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:18.400    overcome the virile virulent bad        900    00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.680    governance and corruption that costs the        901    00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.330    global economy more than a trillion        902    00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:26.200    dollars a year when that happens more        903    00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:29.020    capital would be excited to invest with        904    00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:31.990    urgency that's the real way to counter        905    00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:34.390    violent extremism that is an        906    00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:36.700    indispensable strategy also for        907    00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:39.430    prosperity and a legitimate vision which        908    00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:41.890    I think Americans and people around the        909    00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:44.530    world could fully embrace because it        910    00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:49.240    will create jobs everywhere so members        911    00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:53.350    of the graduating class of 2016 17 of        912    00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:57.460    the Kennedy School of Government above        913    00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:01.330    all this afternoon I urge you to insist        914    00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:03.670    on nothing less        915    00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:06.940    than real answers not just expressions        916    00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:10.890    of anger solutions not just slogans        917    00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:15.970    truth not just talk I know that we can        918    00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:18.340    restore civility to governance I know        919    00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.860    that we can insist on leadership that        920    00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.870    compromises on policy without        921    00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:25.390    compromising on values and principles I        922    00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:28.330    know that we can turn this moment of        923    00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:31.180    adversity into an age of unparalleled        924    00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:34.090    opportunity I know we can harness our        925    00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:36.460    entrepreneurial spirit and our unlimited        926    00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:40.240    ingenuity to tame the worst of robber        927    00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:43.000    baron greed but instead build a shared        928    00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.660    prosperity for all and the reason I know        929    00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:50.050    we can do this is because even against        930    00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:53.740    resistance again and again we have seen        931    00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:56.860    what activism can do when young people        932    00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:58.660    put their minds to it        933    00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:01.870    when I was in college I listened to an        934    00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:03.670    activist by the name of Alan Lowenstein        935    00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:06.070    who came to Yale and gave one of the        936    00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:07.900    most impassioned speeches I'd ever heard        937    00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:11.670    an eloquent plea for engagement it        938    00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:15.580    compelled us many of us to engage in the        939    00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.260    struggle for civil rights in our own        940    00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:20.680    country and we lined up buses and the        941    00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.450    streets of New Haven and drove students        942    00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:24.040    from Yale down to the south and        943    00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.170    elsewhere to be part of the Mississippi        944    00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:28.810    voter registration drive and help break        945    00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:32.350    the back of Jim Crow ultimately we        946    00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:35.680    forced Washington to ensure through the        947    00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.830    law that our values were not just mere        948    00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:42.820    words we saw Congress respond and passed        949    00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:44.110    the Civil Rights Act and the Voting        950    00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:47.760    Rights Act in life in America did change        951    00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.670    not only did landmark Civil Rights        952    00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:53.170    advances grow out of the sit-ins and the        953    00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:55.690    marches but we saw the Environmental        954    00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:57.970    Protection Agency created the Clean        955    00:46:57.970 --> 00:47:00.250    Water Act passed the Safe Drinking Water        956    00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:02.350    the Marine Mammal Protection the Coastal        957    00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:05.010    Zone Management all of it came out of        958    00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:09.540    citizen activism on Earth Day in 1970        959    00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:10.750    activism        960    00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:13.060    that forced the political system to        961    00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:17.470    respond and made the issue a voting        962    00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:20.170    - we saw women        963    00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:23.659    [Applause]        964    00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:28.180    we saw women refused to take a back seat        965    00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:31.350    and force institutions to respond        966    00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:35.350    producing title nine citizens including        967    00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:38.230    veterans of the war spoke up and brought        968    00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:41.040    our brothers in arms' home from vietnam        969    00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:44.920    one of my favorite poems is TS Eliot's        970    00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.980    love song of joy alfred Prufrock and i        971    00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:51.460    challenge all of you never to wind up        972    00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:54.790    fretfully musing as prufrock did do i        973    00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:57.700    dare disturb the universe in a minute        974    00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.530    there is time for decisions and        975    00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:01.620    revisions which a minute will reverse        976    00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:07.420    class of 2017 your job is to disturb the        977    00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:10.150    universe and no matter where you end up        978    00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:13.710    no matter what you choose to do never        979    00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:15.760    underestimate the power that you have        980    00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:19.120    and the extraordinary privilege found in        981    00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.930    one seven letter word citizen think        982    00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:26.140    about it we've tried every form of        983    00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.330    government there is on this planet we've        984    00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:30.790    had constitutional monarchies we've had        985    00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:32.920    parliamentary and presidential systems        986    00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:35.320    we've seen the dangers of theocracy and        987    00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:41.770    fascism in the end it depends on people        988    00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:46.450    it depends on leaders it depends on        989    00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:49.240    building trust and organizing around a        990    00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:52.360    set of principles that are acceptable to        991    00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:56.710    a majority and you you have to build        992    00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:59.620    that majority as Churchill said        993    00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:02.230    democracy is the worst form of        994    00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:06.460    government except for all the others so        995    00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:08.470    it is not a joke for me to stand here        996    00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:10.690    today and say to you you make the        997    00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:11.170    difference        998    00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:15.040    it is not a phony charge at graduation        999    00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:18.280    it's real take it from me after a        1000    00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.920    lifetime of public service when I was        1001    00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.540    the same age as many of you I was        1002    00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:25.050    protesting the war gone wrong and        1003    00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:27.910    sometimes those on the other side would        1004    00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:30.370    confront us even those of us who'd        1005    00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:33.820    served and they would say a slogan to us        1006    00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:37.090    my country right or wrong don't you know        1007    00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:37.809    that        1008    00:49:37.809 --> 00:49:41.289    then we would say to them yes my country        1009    00:49:41.289 --> 00:49:45.130    right or wrong when right keep it right        1010    00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:48.219    and when wrong make it right        1011    00:49:48.219 --> 00:49:51.400    class of 2017 it's your responsibility        1012    00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.880    to disturb the universe and make our        1013    00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:59.199    worlds bright right now congratulations        1014    00:49:59.199 --> 00:50:00.390    and

 86    00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.880    phrase that they hoped would provide an        87    00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.759    easy shorthand of our expectations and        88    00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.960    aspirations for you they put it on        89    00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.280    banners which we hung on your Al Rich        90    00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.960    classroom        91

00:05:35.319    Humanity today I ask you to join me in        95    00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:38.440    reflecting on those words one more        96    00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.240    time how they have influenced your time        97    00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.639    at Harvard Business School and how they        98    00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.880    might continue to provide guidance as        99

educating        107    00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.880    leaders requires        108    00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.440    humility we cannot educate unless you        109    00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.599    have a learning mindset and you cannot        110    00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:25.840    have a learning mindset unless you have        111    00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.759    humility making a difference is not easy        112    00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:33.160    it requires hard        113    00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.080    work in the world means for Humanity        114

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.960    work your memories of your MBA        120    00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.800    experience undoubtedly include late        121    00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.479    nights as you prepared cases polished        122    00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:05.960    presentations wrote papers or completed        123    00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.120    team        124    00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.639    projects although some people may be        125    00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:13.879    born with a solid work ethic most of us        126    00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:18.440    learn it and we do so by striving to        127    00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.840    meet high standards        128    00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.039    consistently I know many of you        129    00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:25.400    occasionally        130    00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.160    wondered can I do this during your first        131    00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.080    semester        132    00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.160    your presence here today is proof that        133    00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.000    persistence and        134    00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.080    resilience attributes that will be        135    00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.520    important throughout your life have        136    00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.199    served you        137    00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:46.240    well we hope your classroom experiences        138    00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.960    have increased your ability to feel and        139    00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.879    demonstrate        140    00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:53.919    humility the case method is especially        141    00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:55.800    helpful in this        142    00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.599    regard it teaches you how to think not        143    00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:03.879    what to think it educates for judgment        144    00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:07.479    by reminding us each day how much we        145    00:08:07.479 --> 00:08:08.479    don't        146    00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:11.479    know I believe the most important lesson        147    00:08:11.479 --> 00:08:13.840    the case method teaches is        148    00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.240    this in most        149    00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.000    situations the shortest route to being        150    00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000    an effective leader is to be the one who        151    00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.080    listens        152    00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.960    intently exhibits curiosity and remains        153    00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.919    open to arguments that might change your        154    00:08:30.919 --> 00:08:31.959    point of        155    00:08:31.959 --> 00:08:33.839    view these        156    00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:38.000    behaviors all require        157    00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.599    humility we hope that during your time        158    00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:44.399    as students you become more aware of how        159    00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:47.880    management decisions impact        160    00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.519    Humanity as managers and leaders we        161    00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:52.880    serve a constellation of stakeholders        162    00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.680    including customers employees investors        163    00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.720    and        164    00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.120    suppliers part of the challenge of being        165    00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.880    a manager is handling the competing        166    00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.160    priorities among these        167    00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.120    groups as you have heard me say before I        168    00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.959    believe business is a powerful force for        169    00:09:11.959 --> 00:09:14.920    good in society lifting millions of        170    00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.600    people out of poverty and providing        171    00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.279    valuable products and services that have        172    00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:23.320    improved standards of living around the        173    00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.160    world across all your courses you've had        174    00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.279    to consider how you too can be a leader        175    00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:34.160    who serves        176    00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.800    Humanity in your final moments as        177    00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.680    students at Harvard Business School I        178    00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.000    now ask you to look forward and consider        179    00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.920    how you will instill hard work with        180    00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.320    humility for Humanity in the        181    00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.640    organizations you will        182    00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.600    lead how do you get an organization to        183    00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.320    embrace hard        184    00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.680    work some leaders do it by setting a        185    00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.079    pace themselves and hoping others can        186    00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:05.800    race to match        187    00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.640    it some leaders do it by focusing on        188    00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.440    culture hiring the right people        189    00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.880    celebrating certain behaviors and        190    00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.959    establishing Norms that communicate this        191    00:10:17.959 --> 00:10:20.160    is the way we do        192    00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.720    things some leaders do it by relying on        193    00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.200    incentives as you think about the best        194    00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.440    way to ensure your team or organization        195    00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.320    ation is working hard I'd urge you to        196    00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.240    consider which methods scale well in the        197    00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.839    modern workplace and which will        198    00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:41.399    not let me give you an        199    00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:44.240    example we used to talk about managing        200    00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.519    by walking        201    00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:48.720    around this informal way of managing        202    00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.839    through observation and Casual        203    00:10:50.839 --> 00:10:54.720    interaction relied on a simple premise        204    00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.000    that workers were physically together        205    00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.839    and in an office        206    00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:02.920    workforces today though can be remot        207    00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.560    remote or hybrid and many are Global        208    00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.920    making this approach infeasible and        209    00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.680    ineffective leading in this require        210    00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.480    environment requires more Reliance on        211    00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.399    culture and        212    00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:21.480    Trust managers will need to make        213    00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.360    employees feel empowered and        214    00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.800    supported managers will need to ensure        215    00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.639    workers are using the new capabilities        216    00:11:31.639 --> 00:11:35.760    of AI to leverage their capabilities and        217    00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.200    expertise and managers will need to        218    00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.040    build teams in which people are judged        219    00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.480    on the outcomes and outputs of their        220    00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.399    work rather than whether they appear        221    00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:50.680    busy of course managers also must be        222    00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.880    attentive to new downsides including the        223    00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.160    risk of burnout ensuring that employees        224    00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.240    aren't working too much and that even        225    00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.720    even in a performance-driven culture        226    00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.040    that emphasizes hard work they maintain        227    00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.120    time for activities that will ensure a        228    00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.320    healthy personal and professional        229    00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.399    balance this is true for you as        230    00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:17.040    well when I think of leaders who have        231    00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.680    energized an organization to embrace        232    00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.040    hard work I think of two of our alumni        233    00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.040    leaders at JP Morgan Chase Jamie Diamond        234    00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.320    and Mary OS        235    00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.279    there is no question that even against        236    00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:35.440    the standards of Wall Street people at        237    00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.000    this organization work extremely hard        238    00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.600    and that's by Design Jamie and Mary are        239    00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.440    Unapologetic about the reality that        240    00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:51.079    success in their industry requires it        241    00:12:51.079 --> 00:12:57.000    yet both also spend many hours mentoring        242    00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.800    subordinates setting the next generation        243    00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.639    of leaders up for        244    00:13:01.639 --> 00:13:05.600    success and they each display deep        245    00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.360    Devotion to their families and are        246    00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.480    active in their        247    00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.199    communities as you think about how you        248    00:13:13.199 --> 00:13:16.480    as a leader will instill hard work in        249    00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.160    your organization there's much you can        250    00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.320    learn from Jamie and        251    00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.000    Mary next how do you get an organization        252    00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.240    to behave with humility        253    00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.920    you do it by emphasizing that even        254    00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.240    successful organizations rarely know all        255    00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.399    the answers you do it by recognizing        256    00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:41.320    that the strategies that made you        257    00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.920    successful in the past won't guarantee        258    00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.519    success in the future you do it by        259    00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:50.759    creating an organization that's hungry        260    00:13:50.759 --> 00:13:54.279    to learn that invests in Innovation to        261    00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:57.480    find new answers to Old problems and        262    00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.120    that is open to ideas an input from        263    00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.680    everyone on the team no matter their        264    00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.959    rank or        265    00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:09.720    status although some may not immediately        266    00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.920    associate Harvard Business School as an        267    00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.759    Exemplar of        268    00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.519    humility everything we do is rooted in        269    00:14:18.519 --> 00:14:19.440    that        270    00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.519    quality in our        271    00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:25.040    classrooms we encourage students to talk        272    00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.000    more than the        273    00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.160    faculty our research is done out in the        274    00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.279    field and predicated on observing        275    00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:36.399    Innovative practices and learning from        276    00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:37.959    real life        277    00:14:37.959 --> 00:14:40.839    managers and although we will always be        278    00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:42.959    proud of the methods we've used to teach        279    00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:44.880    students for more than a        280    00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.040    century we remain open to completely new        281    00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.440    ways of teaching and learning an        282    00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.560    openness that allowed Innovations such        283    00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.519    as HBS online and the field program over        284    00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:58.560    the last decade and that's enabled us to        285    00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.600    embrace the promise of AI to enhance        286    00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.720    rather than diminish teaching and        287    00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.320    learning when I think of leaders who        288    00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.480    have imbued a large organization with a        289    00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.920    sense of humility I think of Warren        290    00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.759    Buffett his annual shareholder letters        291    00:15:18.759 --> 00:15:22.600    are self effacing often reflecting on        292    00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.360    his poor decisions instead of his        293    00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.079    successes the important lesson is this        294    00:15:30.079 --> 00:15:31.360    leaders and        295    00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.079    organizations will make        296    00:15:34.079 --> 00:15:36.279    mistakes and it is        297    00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:40.319    humility that allows them to learn from        298    00:15:40.319 --> 00:15:43.880    them in his personal life Buffett        299    00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.759    remains a model of        300    00:15:46.759 --> 00:15:51.160    humility despite his wealth and fame he        301    00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.720    has lived in the same modest Omaha home        302    00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.160    for nearly 70 years drives a 10-year-old        303    00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.040    car and generally shuns the        304    00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.000    Limelight Eric Roberts advised you        305    00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.839    eloquently        306    00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.279    [Applause]        307    00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:13.600    yesterday to be        308    00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.160    generous Buffet has been a true model of        309    00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.399    generosity too together with Bill and        310    00:16:21.399 --> 00:16:24.000    Melinda French Gates he founded the        311    00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.959    giving pledge encouraging the world's        312    00:16:26.959 --> 00:16:29.600    wealthiest individuals and Families        313    00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.839    to dedicate the majority of their wealth        314    00:16:31.839 --> 00:16:34.560    to philanthropic causes to tackle the        315    00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.440    world's most pressing        316    00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.639    problems finally how do you get an        317    00:16:39.639 --> 00:16:42.920    organization to show concern for        318    00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.959    Humanity you do it by emphasizing the        319    00:16:45.959 --> 00:16:49.920    organization's larger purpose and        320    00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.720    Mission you do it by holding everyone to        321    00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.680    high ethical standards you do it by        322    00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.839    treating employees        323    00:16:59.839 --> 00:17:02.199    with honesty and        324    00:17:02.199 --> 00:17:05.039    respect you do it by focusing on your        325    00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:08.480    customers by making sure that in every        326    00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.079    decision you are thinking of how they        327    00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:14.039    will be affected by what you        328    00:17:14.039 --> 00:17:18.480    do you do it by taking        329    00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.199    actions that increase the trust that        330    00:17:22.199 --> 00:17:25.079    society places on your        331    00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:27.760    business I would also urge you to focus        332    00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.960    on a core principle of design thinking        333    00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.320    which is and rather than or thinking in        334    00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.520    other words searching expansively for        335    00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.640    creating creative and novel Solutions        336    00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.440    rather than reflexively choosing among        337    00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.440    either or        338    00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.160    decisions and thinking will allow you to        339    00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.480    build organizations that serve humanity        340    00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.360    and operate        341    00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.720    profitably in the words of our first        342    00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.720    Dean Edwin gay        343    00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.360    organizations that make a decent        344    00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.360    profit        345    00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.000    decently and thinking will allow you to        346    00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.400    embrace technology and do good for        347    00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.000    Humanity this is what our Alam Stefan        348    00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.280    bunel the CEO of Mona did during covid        349    00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.120    when he developed a platform that helped        350    00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.679    quickly identify the best ways of making        351    00:18:19.679 --> 00:18:22.799    a vaccine and is now using a similar        352    00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:24.880    approach to treat        353    00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.280    cancer another Alum Sal Khan who        354    00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.159    launched KH Academy used AI to create a        355    00:18:32.159 --> 00:18:36.000    torbot for millions of children who do        356    00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.400    not have the opportunity or privilege of        357    00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.120    getting help when they need it and would        358    00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.360    otherwise be left        359    00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.400    behind of course we must also avoid the        360    00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.280    downsides of technology and its negative        361    00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:54.720    effects including bias privacy jobs and        362    00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.600    security but I believe organizations can        363    00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.440    reap the benefits of        364    00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.760    technology and help        365    00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.080    Humanity Stefan and S are vivid examples        366    00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.600    of how hard work with humility for        367    00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.080    Humanity can make a difference in the        368    00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.559    world barely two decades ago they sat        369    00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:17.280    where you sit        370    00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.480    today I am sure neither knew at that        371    00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.159    time what the future would bring but I'm        372    00:19:24.159 --> 00:19:28.240    also certain they left this institution        373    00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.200    believing in the power of business and        374    00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.080    organizations to transform lives this is        375    00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.320    true of you as        376    00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.200    well today in the faces of challenges        377    00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.159    such as climate

--> 00:19:50.559    polarization we need to build resilient        381    00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:53.919    organizations for the long term we need        382    00:19:53.919 --> 00:19:56.640    leaders like you who can imbue the        383    00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.760    values of hard work human humility and        384    00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.039    Humanity as necessary foundations for        385    00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:04.200    such        386    00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.880    organizations there are no better examp        387    00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.600

alone to help move our communities and        46    00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.160    our world forward because that is what        47    00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.040    this era of our country requires of all        48    00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.280    of us when I graduated law school the        49    00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.480    future and its uncertainty seemed vast        50    00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.400    after several decades to degrees        51    00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.040    representing New Mexico in Congress and        52    00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.319    now serving the American people at the        53    00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.040    pleasure of the president I've learned        54    00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.599    that while uncertainty may be the only        55    00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.239    thing that can be guaranteed your        56    00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.560    commitment to helping others and leaving        57    00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.519    the ladder down for future Generations        58    00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.120    is what creates your path        59    00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.519    ahead to be honest thinking about my own        60    00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.680    Journey remind reminds me that        61    00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.959    institutions like the federal government        62    00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.760    and higher education were not built for        63    00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.000    people like me the fact that I stand        64    00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.799    here as the first Native American        65    00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.959    cabinet secretary in our country's        66    00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.920    history is in a word        67    00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.440    remarkable but I don't see it as my        68    00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.120    personal        69    00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.720    accomplishment it's one that many        70    00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.959    indigenous peoples over countless        71    00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.200    Generations worked and sacrificed for I        72    00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.720    am here because of them and I never        73    00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.400    forget that it's because of their        74    00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.799    enduring commitment to survival against        75    00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.920    so many odds that I stand before you        76    00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.080    today which is good because I have a lot        77    00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.959    to        78    00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.519    say our lived experiences create the        79    00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.360    backbone of who we are what we bring to        80    00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.360    the table and the path we will Blaze        81    00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.200    to every student here today your lived        82    00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.280    experience matters the question is what        83    00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.159    will you do with it I didn't start my        84    00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.519    college education until I was 28 years        85    00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.000    old I grew up in a home without any        86    00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.639    college degrees although my parents were        87    00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.639    public servants throughout their careers        88    00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.680    at school I seem to get lost in The        89    00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.840    Ether and my high school counselors and        90    00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.919    teachers simply never encouraged me to        91    00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.800    apply I eventually enrolled at the        92    00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.320    University of New Mexico School of Law        93    00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.120    years later but because I had spent time        94    00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.039    at a graduate program in California the        95    00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.120    law school charged me out of state        96    00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.759    tuition adding an additional        97    00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.759    $18,000 onto my first year as a single        98    00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:49.960    mom this was devastating news but with        99    00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.479    hardship comes innovative        100    00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.520    ideas that experience inspired me to get        101    00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.520    a bill introduced and passed in the New        102    00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.080    Mexico State Legislature that gave        103    00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.720    enrolled members of New Mexico tribes in        104    00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.160    state tuition regardless of their        105    00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.479    residency I argued among other points        106    00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.639    that Native Americans never lose their        107    00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.560    residency with their tribes        108    00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.680    unfortunately the new residency        109    00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.039    designation that I worked so hard to        110    00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.759    enact was not retroactive and so yes I        111    00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.639    am still paying off my student loans but        112    00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.520    thank goodness for forbearance        113    00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.360    right my lived experience and        114    00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.000    perspective even early in my career        115    00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.120    mattered and made a tangible difference        116    00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.639    for Native American students who needed        117    00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.800    barriers removed so that they had the        118    00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.800    opportunity to succeed I challenge each        119    00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.840    of you what will you do with

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.199    haven't always had a seat at any        123    00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:06.080    decisionmaking table it is right and        124    00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.639    just for you to speak up in a room        125    00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.840    around a table in a legal document or in        126    00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.599    a courtroom to ensure their voice is        127    00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.840    heard through you as you leave your law        128    00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.720    school years behind and enter your next        129

00:06:36.960    Fearless Three L's should feel empowered        135    00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.080    because you have endured and maybe even        136    00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.560    enjoyed bouts of the Socratic method        137    00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.280    moot courtz realtime legal experience        138    00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.680    while in clinic many of you may also        139    00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.199    have dedicated significant time doing        140    00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:55.080    pro bono work for various important        141    00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.400    causes that fearlessness to tackle        142    00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.520    something new without holding back        143    00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.800    applies to everything now especially in        144    00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.560    the context of Defending what you know        145    00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.800    is right as some of you may know I ran        146    00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.360    for congress in 2018 I faced a six-way        147    00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.960    primary election and it took all I had        148    00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.800    to walk talk and write for nearly 18        149    00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.680    months straight I was the candidate and        150    00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.240    no one else could stand in for me I had        151    00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.840    to show up each day with a smile and        152    00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.639    quite frankly with a prayer a lot of lot        153    00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:31.560    of people didn't think that as a native        154    00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.000    woman I'd win my primary much less a        155    00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.639    general election but anything worth        156    00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:40.039    having is worth working hard for and my        157    00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:42.919    hard work proved a lot of people wrong        158    00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:46.120    yours will        159    00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:56.759    too through each of these lessons I've        160    00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:58.800    been reminded time and again that every        161    00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.879    job is important important I mentioned        162    00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:02.680    earlier that I started college when I        163    00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.680    was 28 between graduating from high        164    00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.319    school and my late 20s I worked I went        165    00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:11.520    to from part-time to full-time at a        166    00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.479    local bakery alongside me keeping the

00:08:23.599    farmers who made our operation possible        170    00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:26.680    no one in this world does anything alone        171    00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.000    at the department of the Interior I lead        172    00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.560    more than 60,000 person staff that        173    00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.320    crisscrosses our nation and even our        174    00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.719    globe my job and the places it takes me        175    00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:40.320    reminds me time and again that Community        176    00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.120    has always been and will always be        177    00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.800    everything while visiting my ancestral        178    00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.640    homelands of

[Applause]        191    00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.320    at the department this has rung true        192    00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.279    repeatedly as we have advanced our        193    00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:40.279    administration's mission to tackle the        194    00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:42.760    greatest challenges of our lifetimes        195    00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.640    including the climate crisis the things        196    00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.480    we have achieved have been because of        197    00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.720    close partnership and collaboration with        198    00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.720    our legal teams which at interior are        199    00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.480    referred to as        200    00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.959    solicitors late nights long documents        201    00:09:57.959 --> 00:10:01.560    new policies old whole litigation all of        202    00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.040    it has the Fingerprints of dedicated        203    00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.240    lawyers who have committed themselves to        204    00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.279    Public Service I share a few of these        205    00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:11.600    areas of progress because I believe that        206    00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.279    many of you have the desire and        207    00:10:14.279 -->

the transition toward a        210    00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.120    clean energy future we pursued this        211    00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.360    since day one of this Administration and        212    00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.760    I'm deeply proud that the department is        213    00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.760    playing a leading role we're doing this        214    00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.560    through approval of dozens of new        215    00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.440    renewable energy projects on our        216    00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.320    nation's public lands that are bringing        217    00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.560    affordable clean energy to millions of        218    00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.399    households to date we've permitted an        219    00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:47.519    historic 25 gwatt of onshore clean        220    00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:50.040    energy from solar to geothermal to new        221    00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.360    transmission lines stretching from        222    00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.720    California to Arizona to Wyoming with        223    00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.360    more under review that's enough to power        224    00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.079    more than 12 million        225    00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.560    homes using the power of our ocean we        226    00:11:10.560 -->

first eight offshore wind        229    00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.680    energy projects enough to power four        230    00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.560    million homes with more on the way in        231    00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.600    the coming        232    00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.440    months when we see nature as our Ally        233    00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.000    and really act like nature is our Ally        234    00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.519    we can accomplish tremendous progress        235    00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:36.279    for our climate our planet and the        236    00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:38.399    communities that depend on these natural        237    00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:42.480    spaces to thrive every day for example        238    00:11:42.480 -->

Sagebrush ecosystem is        248    00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.440    the largest contiguous ecotype in the        249    00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.399    United States comprising onethird of the        250    00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:23.000    land mass of the lower 48 states but in        251    00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000    the last 20 years half of this area has        252    00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.560    been lost due to climate change and        253    00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.639    habitat destruction our Sagebrush        254    00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:33.600    Keystone initiative combines        255    00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.240    community-led conservation with Federal        256    00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.680    partnership to defend and grow the core        257    00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.120    for future generations to        258    00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.920    Steward our Keystone initiatives from        259    00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.839    grasslands in Appalachia to drought and        260    00:12:47.839 --> 00:12:50.800    Wildfire are sweeping and expansive by        261    00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.279    Design but at the heart of the framework        262    00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:54.120    is        263    00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.320    collaboration because we aren't going to        264    00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.440    get anywhere meaningful if we don't        265    00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.480    bring every partner to the table that        266    00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.560    partnership must include Indian tribes        267    00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.399    indigenous peoples indigenous knowledge        268    00:13:07.399 --> 00:13:10.120    incurred over Millennia informs how we        269    00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.320    build a better world that extends to how        270    00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.480    our team addresses the wrongs of the        271    00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.160    past and how we correct harmful policies        272    00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.560    and decisions that were designed to        273    00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.440    eradicate native        274    00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.720    peoples when I announced the federal        275    00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.120    Indian boarding school initiative I        276    00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.560    didn't realize that it would become a        277    00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.880    core Legacy issue for our department our        278    00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.440    goal was noble and mighty to unravel the        279    00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.360    intergenerational trauma that has        280    00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.120    plagued our communities since the start        281    00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.560    of this horrific era an era that saw        282    00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.639    indigenous children including my        283    00:13:45.639 --> 00:13:48.040    grandparents torn from their families        284    00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.920    and taken to government sponsored        285    00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.240    schools that stripped them of their        286    00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.720    languages their cultures and their        287    00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.160    lifeways this is the first time the        288    00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.160    federal government has researched the        289    00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.959    details of these schools the children        290    00:14:02.959 --> 00:14:05.360    who attended and the funding that        291    00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.360    impacts that assimilation policies had        292    00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.360    on the children their families and their        293    00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.560    larger        294    00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.839    communities I have traveled across the        295    00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:15.880    country to Bear witness to the many        296    00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.480    survivors of the boarding school era to        297    00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.120    give them space to share their stories        298    00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.759    shed their tears and to know that they        299    00:14:23.759 --> 00:14:26.800    are seen and heard we have so much more        300    00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.680    to do to reconcile this painful chapter        301    00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.560    in our nation's history but our progress        302    00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.320    is        303    00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.839    real the department has also made        304    00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:37.320    critical improvements to the        305    00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.839    implementation of laws like the Native        306    00:14:39.839 --> 00:14:42.079    American Graves protection and        307    00:14:42.079 --> 00:14:45.040    repatriation act passed over three        308    00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.000    decades ago the law aims to return        309    00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.240    sacred objects and the remains of our        310    00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.720    ancestors to the communities from which        311    00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.959    they were stolen stolen from digging up        312    00:14:56.959 --> 00:14:59.759    Graves of our ancestors from from sacred        313    00:14:59.759 --> 00:15:02.680    sites from people's homes and        314    00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.800    lands despite this essential charge the        315    00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.440    law has too often been under prioritized        316    00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.199    by universities and museums including        317    00:15:11.199 --> 00:15:14.199    the peab peab museum right here on        318    00:15:14.199 --> 00:15:17.160    campus in December though we announced        319    00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.040    Define a rule that streamlines        320    00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.040    requirements for institutions to        321    00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.000    inventory and identify these items        322    00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.120    increases accountability and prioritizes        323    00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.839    tribal consent already several including        324    00:15:30.839 --> 00:15:33.480    Peabody are changing the policies and        325    00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.480    procedures that govern this work I'm        326    00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.399    grateful that now thanks to this        327    00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:40.920    collaborative effort tribes can be        328    00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.759    reunited with their cultural property        329    00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:48.720    and finally lay their ancestors to        330    00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.120    rest the these are just some of our        331    00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.319    Department's Milestones winds for our        332    00:16:01.319 --> 00:16:03.480    climate our lands and Waters and the        333    00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.120    communities who depend on these        334    00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.199    resources every single day it might be        335    00:16:08.199 --> 00:16:10.519    hard to picture the people Behind These        336    00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:13.440    successes well the fact is they look        337    00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.399    like        338    00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:17.639    you each of you have more power than you        339    00:16:17.639 --> 00:16:20.880    realize you're Harvard Law graduates for        340    00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.360    goodness sakes        341    00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.680    you have the power to build off these        342    00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.040    accomplishments and to continue moving        343    00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.600    our country toward the sustainable        344    00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.680    ethical plentiful future we know is        345    00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.079    possible for        346    00:16:41.079 --> 00:16:43.680    everyone I know for a fact you're all        347    00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.720    powerful because Harvard Law graduates        348    00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.800    and former faculty have helped lead our        349    00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.160    momentous efforts at the department        350    00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.440    since day one nowhere is that clearer        351    00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.839    than the work we are doing in Indian        352    00:16:55.839 --> 00:16:58.440    Country guiding us in our work is the        353    00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:03.600    solic is the solicitor Bob        354    00:17:08.039 --> 00:17:11.120    Anderson for over a decade Bob was the        355    00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.919    Onida Indian Nation visiting professor        356    00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:17.480    of law here at Harvard Law School his        357    00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.839    contributions to our team have inspired        358    00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:22.240    us all but one accomplishment in        359    00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.760    particular is close to my        360    00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.679    heart last year the Supreme Court stood        361    00:17:27.679 --> 00:17:30.600    behind the Indian child welfare act or        362    00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.200    IA ending a lawsuit against our        363    00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.039    department and        364    00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:37.679    me that challenged keeping on        365    00:17:37.679 --> 00:17:40.880    reservation child adoptees with their        366    00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.600    tribes this was a legal precedent en        367    00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.480    fored by the violent boarding school        368    00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.960    Legacy I spoke of earlier the horrific        369    00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.960    impacts of this Legacy are more        370    00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.919    prominent than we realize in fact like        371    00:17:53.919 --> 00:17:56.440    me you probably know someone who has        372    00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.240    been        373    00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.679    impacted a dear friend friend of mine        374    00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:02.360    and all six of her siblings were adopted        375    00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.919    out of their family and raised apart my        376    00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:07.880    friend has spent the better part of her        377    00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.840    adult life working to piece together the        378    00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.400    family she should have had growing        379    00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.919    up this important equa decision upheld        380    00:18:16.919 --> 00:18:18.919    what presidents and Congressional        381    00:18:18.919 --> 00:18:20.960    majorities on both sides of the aisle        382    00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.000    have recognized for the past four        383    00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.280    decades that Indian children belong with        384    00:18:26.280 -->

Today, it is my great honor and pleasure        24    00:09:56.529 --> 00:10:01.867    to introduce Harvard Kennedy Schools    Graduation Speaker for 2024        25    00:10:02.501 --> 00:10:06.405    Ambassador of the United States    to the People's Republic of China.        26    00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:09.842    Nicholas Burns.        27    00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.053    Our distinguished Speaker        28    00:10:21.053 --> 00:10:25.391    was a much admired member    of our faculty for 13 years.        29    00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:30.496    He was an honored teacher and mentor    to countless students        30    00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.900    and esteemed colleague,    to faculty and staff members,        31    00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:39.405    and a wise and trusted    advisor to me as Dean.        32    00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.508    He left the school when he was sworn        33    00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:45.511    in as ambassador in 2021.        34    00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:48.914    I hope that someday we will persuade him    to come home        35    00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:52.218    to the Kennedy School faculty again.        36    00:10:58.824

stellar example        39    00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:10.036    of principled    and effective public service.        40    00:11:11.137 --> 00:11:14.140    He has had a distinguished career    in government        41    00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.043    serving for a quarter century in the U.S.        42    00:11:17.043 --> 00:11:19.078    Department of State.        43    00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:22.448    He has tackled consequential matters    in international affairs.        44    00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:28.421    Use his deep insight and broad experience    to build greater understandings        45    00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:33.426    and better relations    between nations and between peoples.        46    00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:35.361    As the U.S.        47

traveled widely in China.        51    00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:57.817    Since pandemic restrictions were lifted    and he has called for a major increase        52    00:11:57.817 --> 00:12:02.421    in student exchanges and academic links    between the two countries.        53    00:12:03.489 --> 00:12:05.658    In his previous time    in the State Department.        54    00:12:05.658 -->

We're in a deep recession.        246    00:24:20.158 --> 00:24:22.561    It was a troubling time.        247    00:24:22.561 --> 00:24:25.797    I think a lot of my colleagues, male    and female, went into the government        248    00:24:25.797 --> 00:24:28.800    because, you know,    we just wanted our country        249    00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:32.370    to be a positive,    global, global influence.        250    00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:36.775    We wanted to get our country back    into engaging with the rest of the world.        251    00:24:37.576 --> 00:24:41.179    And I'm forever grateful    for those years in public service.        252    00:24:42.047 --> 00:24:45.050    It gave me the opportunity    and a lot of my friends        253    00:24:45.584 --> 00:24:49.221    to work on really consequential issues    over the last couple of decades.        254    00:24:50.489 --> 00:24:53.558    The fact that the Soviet Union    and communism collapsed in        255    00:24:53.558 --> 00:24:55.360    Europe was an epical event.        256    00:24:56.828 --> 00:24:59.831    911.     One of the worst days in our history.        257    00:25:00.098 --> 00:25:02.801    I was at NATO's ambassador.        258    00:25:02.801 --> 00:25:06.705    All the narrow countries    within six, 7 hours said, we're with you.        259    00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:10.509    And they invoked Article five to come    to the defense of the United States.        260    00:25:10.542 --> 00:25:13.044    That was an incredible day.        261    00:25:13.044 --> 00:25:15.514    To feel that we had something        262    00:25:15.514 --> 00:25:18.517    in common with Canada    and the European countries.        263    00:25:19.317 --> 00:25:21.987    And then there's    the other side of the coin.        264    00:25:21.987 --> 00:25:24.256    But really difficult issues,        265    00:25:24.256 --> 00:25:27.759    our ill fated wars in Iraq    and Afghanistan.        266    00:25:27.759 --> 00:25:28.827    And I was part of that.        267    00:25:28.827 --> 00:25:31.830    And we had to account for that    and think about it        268    00:25:32.097 --> 00:25:35.667    and try to understand    the lessons of those two wars.        269    00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:38.803    And I taught courses here    where we thought about        270    00:25:38.803 --> 00:25:41.806    the lessons of those wars.        271    00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.077    Many of our graduates    today have been public service        272    00:25:46.912 --> 00:25:49.814    or will become public service,        273    00:25:49.814 --> 00:25:52.417    so they know the intrinsic value        274    00:25:52.417 --> 00:25:55.420    of what it's like to be in public service.        275    00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:59.190    You're in an enterprise    in a job with a team        276    00:25:59.658 --> 00:26:03.428    that's bigger than you,    that's more important than you.        277    00:26:04.129 --> 00:26:08.733    A team that's pointed forward    towards a goal, whether you're a Brazilian        278    00:26:09.134 --> 00:26:13.305    or Indonesian or South African or German,    wherever you're from.        279    00:26:13.305 --> 00:26:15.907    In the world    of the United States of America,        280    00:26:15.907 --> 00:26:20.178    there's something really beautiful    about that enterprise government.        281    00:26:21.112 --> 00:26:24.049    And it's been interesting for me    and really heartening        282    00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:27.152    to go back to government    and be part of that team.        283    00:26:27.886 --> 00:26:31.489    It's a chance    to contribute to your children's world        284    00:26:32.324 --> 00:26:34.826    and your grandchildren's world.        285    00:26:34.826 --> 00:26:37.262    And when I retired    in 2008, the first time,        286    00:26:38.229 --> 00:26:41.199    I thought, you know, how can I continue        287    00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:44.636    to be a public servant    in another another vain?        288    00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:50.108    And thankfully, I'd work with four people    who had left Harvard        289    00:26:50.875 --> 00:26:53.878    to go into the US government    and come back to Harvard        290    00:26:54.045 --> 00:26:56.014    Professor Graham Allison,        291    00:26:56.014 --> 00:26:59.451    Professor Joe Nye, Professor Larry Summers        292    00:27:00.085 --> 00:27:03.288    and our great friend, the late Professor    Ash Carter.        293    00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:07.425    And they said, Come to Harvard and teach.        294    00:27:08.426 --> 00:27:10.528    And I hesitated.        295    00:27:10.528 --> 00:27:13.531    I hadn't been in a classroom    since my student days.        296    00:27:13.698 --> 00:27:15.467    I'd never taught before.        297    00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:18.169    I'm not a Ph.D..        298    00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:22.073    And frankly, negotiating the Iran    nuclear issue, that was one thing.        299    00:27:22.741 --> 00:27:27.512    Standing in front of a class of Harvard    graduate students, a little bit daunting.        300    00:27:28.179 --> 00:27:31.149    Professors don't like to tell you that,    but it's true.        301    00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.318    But I agreed to try it for a year,        302    00:27:34.386 --> 00:27:37.055    and I stayed for 13.        303    00:27:37.055 --> 00:27:40.258    I loved    everything about the Kennedy School,        304    00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:43.361    and that's really come flooding back        305    00:27:43.361 --> 00:27:46.564    for Libby and me in the last two days.        306    00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:49.834    I love the mission. Look at these banners.        307    00:27:49.934 --> 00:27:52.937    Ask what you can do.        308    00:27:54.272 --> 00:27:56.141    I love Professor Allison's        309    00:27:56.141 --> 00:27:59.678    description    of the unique value of the Kennedy School.        310    00:27:59.711 --> 00:28:01.212    Here's what he said.        311    00:28:01.212 --> 00:28:04.716    He said, there's an intellectual union    of the young and the old.        312    00:28:05.383 --> 00:28:07.385    The young. That's all of you.        313    00:28:07.385 --> 00:28:10.722    Energy, creativity, optimism.        314    00:28:11.122 --> 00:28:11.690    The all.        315    00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:15.160    That's me and a couple of other professors    here.        316    00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.730    We've got more yesterdays than tomorrows.        317    00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:23.034    We got a little bit of life experience    and perhaps a bit of wisdom        318    00:28:23.468 --> 00:28:26.438    to contribute in the classroom.        319    00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:29.240    I'll tell you what I really loved.        320    00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.609    I love looking out in my class.        321    00:28:31.609 --> 00:28:34.746    I taught big classes, 50, 60 students,        322    00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.883    and the extraordinary kaleidoscope        323    00:28:39.284 --> 00:28:42.053    of ethnic, racial        324    00:28:42.053 --> 00:28:48.259    and religious and gender diversity    in this class, fundamentally different        325    00:28:48.259 --> 00:28:51.429    than the classrooms I'd been in four    or five decades ago.        326    00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.133    As a college and graduate student,        327    00:28:55.166 --> 00:28:57.702    that was really inspiring        328    00:28:57.702 --> 00:29:00.972    and it was really inspiring to see    who was in the front row        329    00:29:01.706 --> 00:29:04.075    of those classrooms.        330    00:29:04.075 --> 00:29:07.078    Invariably, immigrants,        331    00:29:07.145 --> 00:29:10.148    invariably first generation Americans,        332    00:29:10.482 --> 00:29:14.619    refugees to the United States,    people who came from families        333    00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.990    who in many cases    had not had anybody go to university        334    00:29:19.657 --> 00:29:22.961    because they weren't given access    to a university degree.        335    00:29:22.961 --> 00:29:26.865    That was a beautiful memory    that I have of Harvard Kennedy School        336    00:29:28.199 --> 00:29:32.203    in my very first week here as September    President drew files.        337    00:29:32.237 --> 00:29:34.539    She was a great university president.        338    00:29:34.539 --> 00:29:37.509    She sent an email to 20,000 people    in the Harvard community,        339    00:29:38.143 --> 00:29:41.379    and there was an email about what was    going to happen during the school year.        340    00:29:41.379 --> 00:29:45.216    And at the very end of that email,    as I remember it, she said.        341    00:29:45.917 --> 00:29:49.521    But the fundamental purpose    of Harvard University is        342    00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:53.758    the pursuit of knowledge.        343    00:29:53.758 --> 00:29:56.761    Four words The pursuit of knowledge        344    00:29:57.228 --> 00:29:59.798    that made a huge impression on me.        345    00:29:59.798 --> 00:30:03.902    I come from the government    where we have 4000 missions.        346    00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:07.672    She was articulating one mission.        347    00:30:08.173 --> 00:30:10.241    Harvard's mission was extraordinary.        348    00:30:10.241 --> 00:30:13.344    I thought, to research and study        349    00:30:13.678 --> 00:30:18.016    everything about everything, every subject        350    00:30:18.716 --> 00:30:21.719    in every academic    and intellectual discipline.        351    00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:25.323    I found that really exciting    and really meaningful.        352    00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:30.295    Think of the power of this university    and of every university,        353    00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:33.965    the power to investigate the past.        354    00:30:33.965 --> 00:30:36.968    The Poems of Emily Dickinson.        355    00:30:37.068 --> 00:30:40.071    The Impact of the Napoleonic Wars.        356    00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:43.074    The Women's Suffragette Movement        357    00:30:43.074 --> 00:30:46.077    in the 19th and 20th Century.        358    00:30:46.377 --> 00:30:49.380    Universities    have a power to drive the future.        359    00:30:49.848 --> 00:30:51.249    Artificial technology.        360    00:30:51.249 --> 00:30:53.952    Robotics. Quantum science.        361    00:30:53.952 --> 00:30:55.954    Cancer research.        362    00:30:55.954 --> 00:30:59.490    Universities move the humanities forward        363    00:31:00.225 --> 00:31:03.027    and they shine a path toward the future.        364    00:31:03.027 --> 00:31:05.296    And they free minds.        365    00:31:05.296 --> 00:31:09.167    And they ensure free    speech and free thinking.        366    00:31:10.635 --> 00:31:11.369    And people who        367    00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:14.439    speak up and people    who stand their ground.        368    00:31:15.173 --> 00:31:20.912    That's beautiful about this university    and this school and all universities.        369    00:31:20.945 --> 00:31:24.215    So my advice    and you haven't asked me for it,        370    00:31:24.816 --> 00:31:27.418    but a speaker supposed to give it        371    00:31:27.418 --> 00:31:30.755    take that power and freedom of imagination    and inquiry.        372    00:31:31.589 --> 00:31:35.793    Take the innovation with you    to the next stage of your life.        373    00:31:37.996 --> 00:31:40.331    So when you think about it,        374    00:31:40.331 --> 00:31:42.467    every time people graduate, every time        375    00:31:42.467 --> 00:31:45.470    there's a speaker speaking for.        376    00:31:45.503 --> 00:31:48.506    So it seems there's one theme        377    00:31:48.606 --> 00:31:50.942    You're graduating,        378    00:31:50.942 --> 00:31:53.912    you're leaving this world    for another world outside the tent,        379    00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:57.315    outside the gates,    outside the fence of the university.        380    00:31:59.017 --> 00:32:01.586    The world needs change.        381    00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:04.155    The world needs your help.        382    00:32:04.155 --> 00:32:06.190    Change the world.        383    00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:09.160    Change it for the better.        384    00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.162    Make it more humane.        385    00:32:11.162 --> 00:32:11.829    Make it more.        386    00:32:11.829 --> 00:32:14.832    Just make it more prosperous.        387    00:32:15.199 --> 00:32:17.835    Make it more peaceful.        388    00:32:17.835 --> 00:32:20.805    And we need peace in 2024.        389    00:32:22.206 --> 00:32:23.041    Now, I realize        390    00:32:23.041 --> 00:32:26.044    that that sounds a little bit    like a Hallmark card.        391    00:32:26.844 --> 00:32:29.147    A little bit naive.        392    00:32:29.147 --> 00:32:32.016    It'd be asking a bit much        393    00:32:32.016 --> 00:32:35.019    for your class to cure cancer        394    00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.589    in a fairer    make world peace in your first year out.        395    00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:42.860    But change however small or large,        396    00:32:43.528 --> 00:32:47.932    however incremental or transformative,    it's still the right message.        397    00:32:48.599 --> 00:32:52.403    It's still the right goal    because graduations serve        398    00:32:53.171 --> 00:32:55.640    as a changing mechanism.        399    00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.042    They're a changing of the guard        400    00:32:58.042 --> 00:33:00.311    from the old generation        401    00:33:00.311 --> 00:33:02.714    to your new generation.        402    00:33:02.714 --> 00:33:05.249    And we're handing that baton    of leadership out        403    00:33:05.249 --> 00:33:08.252    off to you today.        404    00:33:08.586 --> 00:33:12.123    And I got to tell you, my generation    is leaving you an imperfect world.        405    00:33:12.523 --> 00:33:14.325    Imperfect.        406    00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:17.328    Forgive us.        407    00:33:18.863 --> 00:33:22.000    Here are just a few of the challenges        408    00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:27.038    that your class    is going to face in the next decade or so.        409    00:33:28.239 --> 00:33:30.074    Climate change.        410    00:33:30.074 --> 00:33:33.011    It's the existential threat        411    00:33:33.011 --> 00:33:35.713    to 8 billion people on Earth,        412    00:33:35.713 --> 00:33:38.716    the existential threat to humanity.        413    00:33:38.716 --> 00:33:41.719    And we are lagging behind.        414    00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:44.589    We're lagging behind        415    00:33:44.589 --> 00:33:47.558    in limiting the average global increase        416    00:33:47.725 --> 00:33:50.728    to 1.5 degrees centigrade.        417    00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:54.532    Find a way to get us back on course.        418    00:33:54.565 --> 00:33:57.402    There's nothing more important    for all of us        419    00:33:57.402 --> 00:34:00.605    in this tent and all future generations    beyond.        420    00:34:01.973 --> 00:34:03.307    Second.        421    00:34:03.307 --> 00:34:07.845    Technology has moved    to the very center of global politics.        422    00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:11.983    We see the enormous promise    in biotechnology, quantum        423    00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:14.986    science, robotics and AI.        424    00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:17.822    We also see the dark side,        425    00:34:17.822 --> 00:34:22.827    a forbidding example, a risk, for example,    of trying to manage A.I.        426    00:34:22.827 --> 00:34:25.430    in a nuclear weapons world.        427    00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:29.067    So finally, to find a way    to get that balance on technology, right?        428    00:34:30.268 --> 00:34:32.103    Third,        429    00:34:32.103 --> 00:34:35.106    democracy is under assault        430    00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.341    in the United States        431    00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:41.679    and other countries challenged    from within.        432    00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:43.681    In many cases        433    00:34:43.681 --> 00:34:46.684    by anti-democratic forces        434    00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:50.021    and challenged from without        435    00:34:50.021 --> 00:34:52.590    by authoritarian countries        436    00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:55.626    trying to change the world order    and diminish        437    00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.729    the inherent rights, human rights        438    00:34:58.729 --> 00:35:01.766    that all people in all countries have.        439    00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.403    Defend democracy.        440    00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.873    Fourth,        441    00:35:08.873 --> 00:35:11.876    brutal wars have broken out        442    00:35:12.009 --> 00:35:13.744    in Ukraine.        443    00:35:13.744 --> 00:35:16.747    Russia's assault on Ukraine.        444    00:35:17.381 --> 00:35:21.652    In Israel, in Gaza, in parts of Africa,        445    00:35:23.488 --> 00:35:26.491    the highest priority    in international politics should be        446    00:35:27.158 --> 00:35:30.161    stop the wars and end the bloodshed.        447    00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:43.007    Fifth,        448    00:35:43.007 --> 00:35:46.177    there are multiple a multitude        449    00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:49.981    of what we would call    transnational problems, problems        450    00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:54.585    that are flowing under and over    and right through everybody's borders.        451    00:35:55.419 --> 00:35:57.421    They know no borders.        452    00:35:57.421 --> 00:35:59.390    Let me just list a couple.        453    00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.559    Cyber aggression.        454    00:36:01.559 --> 00:36:04.061    The race for dominance in Space.        455    00:36:04.061 --> 00:36:06.130    Global health challenges.        456    00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:08.199    Billions of people.        457    00:36:08.199 --> 00:36:09.133    More than 2 billion.        458    00:36:09.133 --> 00:36:12.003    Still below the global poverty line.        459    00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:13.137    Human trafficking.        460    00:36:13.137 --> 00:36:15.940    Trafficking of women and children.        461    00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:18.943    Ever more powerful Drug    and criminal cartels.        462    00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:22.313    Alarming income inequality    all over the world.        463    00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.116    And, of course, terrorism.        464    00:36:25.116 --> 00:36:28.519    These are seemingly overwhelming    challenges.        465    00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:32.023    And we could add    if we went around this tent        466    00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:34.659    and asked for ideas, a thousand more.        467    00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:36.427    It is.        468    00:36:36.427 --> 00:36:39.564    These    are the defining challenges of our time.        469    00:36:40.031 --> 00:36:44.035    Use your HK network around the world,        470    00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:48.639    across borders    to coalesce to fight these challenges.        471    00:36:50.141 --> 00:36:53.444    Now, I got to I have to admit,    these are heavy issues to contemplate        472    00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:57.848    on what should be a celebratory day    for all of you.        473    00:36:57.848 --> 00:37:00.518    Forgive me once again,        474    00:37:00.518 --> 00:37:03.421    but it is the real world    you're going to inherit        475    00:37:03.421 --> 00:37:05.590    when you leave Harvard after tomorrow,    after        476    00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:08.593    you get your degree.        477    00:37:08.626 --> 00:37:13.030    Libby My wife, Libby,    came to one of my lectures at Harvard        478    00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:17.902    a couple of years ago on the subject    of these transnational challenges.        479    00:37:18.302 --> 00:37:21.305    In this period of racing global change,        480    00:37:21.439 --> 00:37:25.776    and we were walking home here    in Cambridge, just down Brattle Street        481    00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:29.680    after the lecture, I said,    How'd that go, Libby?        482    00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:32.917    She said, You're depressing everybody.        483    00:37:34.418 --> 00:37:35.820    She said,        484    00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:38.823    All that talk about nuclear war    and climate change.        485    00:37:39.156 --> 00:37:42.159    There are problems in the world,    of course,        486    00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.595    but you got to give people hope        487    00:37:44.595 --> 00:37:47.598    in Libby, as always, was right.        488    00:37:47.898 --> 00:37:50.401    The last thing I want to do is depress you        489    00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:53.804    all and your families    the day before graduation.        490    00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:56.540    So let's talk about hope.        491    00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.509    Let's talk about hope.        492    00:37:58.509 --> 00:38:01.479    I do believe you can be change agents.        493    00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:05.049    And as a Kennedy School network,    you have that opportunity.        494    00:38:06.117 --> 00:38:09.153    But you also have the obligation        495    00:38:09.987 --> 00:38:13.524    as a Kennedy School graduate    to be that change agent.        496    00:38:15.026 --> 00:38:18.029    Kennedy School's very different    from a lot of schools.        497    00:38:18.162 --> 00:38:22.366    You studied under banners and we've    got them here today, as I pointed out.        498    00:38:23.034 --> 00:38:27.438    And those banners are from President    Kennedy, for whom the school is named.        499    00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:28.773    Ask what you can do.        500    00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:33.611    It's not what will I gain?        501    00:38:33.878 --> 00:38:35.880    It's not        502    00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.748    what will I        503    00:38:37.748 --> 00:38:39.383    profit from?        504    00:38:39.383 --> 00:38:41.452    It's not what's in it for me.        505    00:38:41.452 --> 00:38:42.753    It's what.        506    00:38:42.753 --> 00:38:45.323    Ask what you can do        507    00:38:45.323 --> 00:38:47.825    to make this a better world.        508    00:38:47.825 --> 00:38:50.361    And the Kennedy School asks that        509    00:38:50.361 --> 00:38:54.131    you not just be involved in the world,    but be great in the world        510    00:38:55.199 --> 00:38:56.534    as individuals.        511    00:38:56.534 --> 00:39:00.071    Great in the truest sense,    have an impact on the world,        512    00:39:00.971 --> 00:39:03.974    both as individuals and as a class.        513    00:39:04.508 --> 00:39:07.778    And in that regard, we had another speaker        514    00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:11.248    in Harvard Yard in September 1943.        515    00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:16.253    It was Winston Churchill    who came to Harvard in the middle        516    00:39:16.253 --> 00:39:21.859    of the Second World War, and he challenged    Harvard students way back then        517    00:39:22.426 --> 00:39:27.832    with a message that is strikingly,    I think, relevant to your class today.        518    00:39:28.332 --> 00:39:32.770    Here's what he said    to the Harvard students in 1943.        519    00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:36.841    The price of greatness is responsibility.        520    00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:43.381    Churchill said one cannot rise    to be in many ways, the leading country        521    00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:48.085    in the world without being involved    in the world's problems,        522    00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:51.389    convulsed by its agonies        523    00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:54.392    and inspired by its causes.        524    00:39:54.692 --> 00:39:57.695    The people of the United States, Churchill    concluded,        525    00:39:57.962 --> 00:40:01.165    cannot escape world responsibility.        526    00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:05.469    That was a powerful message to a country    that had been isolationist.        527    00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:09.473    And if you look at the public opinion    polls in America today,        528    00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.843    we've got some isolationist    sentiment back.        529    00:40:13.177 --> 00:40:15.546    How is that possible        530    00:40:15.546 --> 00:40:17.515    in a time when we are all connected        531    00:40:17.515 --> 00:40:20.518    around the world    and your class personifies that        532    00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:24.088    when the only way forward    is to combine forces        533    00:40:24.755 --> 00:40:29.160    with people, students,    universities around the world?        534    00:40:30.428 --> 00:40:32.329    That's an important warning        535    00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:36.434    that we might recall    from the memory of 1943.        536    00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:40.538    You've got an opportunity to lead    and you have an obligation to lead.        537    00:40:41.071 --> 00:40:42.706    And you know, you have a choice, too.        538    00:40:44.008 --> 00:40:44.408    You could        539    00:40:44.408 --> 00:40:47.378    be overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude        540    00:40:47.478 --> 00:40:50.915    of the challenges before your class,    and we really couldn't blame you.        541    00:40:52.016 --> 00:40:55.019    Or you could find the collective vision,        542    00:40:55.052 --> 00:40:58.055    the collective faith, the collective        543    00:40:59.056 --> 00:41:02.059    courage to do something about it.        544    00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:06.297    Previous generations    were overwhelmed, too,        545    00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:08.732    by a multitude of problems.        546    00:41:08.732 --> 00:41:11.702    But as so often happens,    far sighted, courageous        547    00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:14.705    people stood up to lead.        548    00:41:15.506 --> 00:41:17.708    Think of Lincoln        549    00:41:17.708 --> 00:41:21.111    writing the Emancipation Proclamation.        550    00:41:21.912 --> 00:41:24.915    Think of Susan B Anthony        551    00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:27.985    and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, asserting        552    00:41:27.985 --> 00:41:30.988    that women have fundamental rights    in the 19th century.        553    00:41:32.189 --> 00:41:32.890    Think of Dr.        554    00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:36.460    Martin Luther King writing a single letter        555    00:41:37.495 --> 00:41:41.065    from a Birmingham jail    that changed history.        556    00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:47.104    Think of Nelson    Mandela, 27 years in prison.        557    00:41:48.105 --> 00:41:51.575    And yet he emerged to dismantle apartheid        558    00:41:52.042 --> 00:41:55.980    and create a multiracial South Africa    just three decades ago.        559    00:41:57.081 --> 00:42:00.084    Think of the courage of a Polish pope,        560    00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:03.621    Karol Wojtyla,    who stood against soulless communism.        561    00:42:04.488 --> 00:42:06.857    Think of the courage in our day        562    00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:09.460    of President Volodymyr Zelensky        563    00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:13.964    standing up to a wicked despot    in Vladimir Putin.        564    00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:17.268    Think of the bravery        565    00:42:17.268 --> 00:42:20.204    of your commencement speaker at Harvard    tomorrow.        566    00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:21.872    Maria Ressa.        567    00:42:21.872 --> 00:42:25.476    She's standing up for press freedoms        568    00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:28.712    around the world.        569    00:42:28.712 --> 00:42:31.916    We have examples from the past    that can lead us forward.        570    00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:35.419    And we have other examples.        571    00:42:35.419 --> 00:42:39.156    When I taught here, am I great powers    course in my diplomacy course.        572    00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:42.192    I'd also always end each semester,        573    00:42:42.192 --> 00:42:45.729    each class at the very end with a dramatic        574    00:42:45.729 --> 00:42:50.801    reading of a speech by Theodore    Roosevelt at the Sorbonne in 1910.        575    00:42:50.834 --> 00:42:53.637    It's known as the Man in the Arena speech.        576    00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:56.173    Why don't we modernize Roosevelt?        577    00:42:56.173 --> 00:43:01.211    The person in the arena,    the woman as well as the man in the arena.        578    00:43:01.679 --> 00:43:02.479    Here's what he said.        579    00:43:03.948 --> 00:43:04.748    He said the credit        580    00:43:04.748 --> 00:43:07.751    belongs to those who have the courage    to step into the arena.        581    00:43:07.785 --> 00:43:10.654    He meant what we would call    public service.        582    00:43:10.654 --> 00:43:12.256    At Harvard Kennedy School.        583    00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:15.793    And he praised those who fight for change,        584    00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:20.798    even if they're bloodied,    even if they fail in the process.        585    00:43:21.632 --> 00:43:23.934    And he ends with a key message        586    00:43:23.934 --> 00:43:26.604    that I think    I hope might have some resonance        587    00:43:26.604 --> 00:43:29.540    with your class as you step out        588    00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:32.576    to fight the battles in the arena of 2024.        589    00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:36.380    He seven he said even if she fails,        590    00:43:37.514 --> 00:43:40.517    at least she fails while daring greatly        591    00:43:40.884 --> 00:43:43.887    so that her place shall never be        592    00:43:43.988 --> 00:43:46.690    with those cold and timid souls        593    00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.660    who know neither victory nor defeat.        594    00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.895    Isn't that an amazing quote?        595    00:43:51.895 --> 00:43:54.131    What was he saying?        596    00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:57.368    You're never going to change the world    from your living room armchair.        597    00:43:58.569 --> 00:43:59.370    You're never going to        598    00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:02.373    change the world    unless you take some risks,        599    00:44:02.439 --> 00:44:05.776    unless you go out into the world    to do things that are hard        600    00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:09.213    and difficult and daunting.        601    00:44:09.613 --> 00:44:12.616    Change the world by taking those risks.        602    00:44:14.051 --> 00:44:16.787    There's a final issue        603    00:44:16.787 --> 00:44:19.390    that we should discuss,        604    00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:22.259    and that's the challenges    that you've been facing        605    00:44:22.259 --> 00:44:26.497    as individuals    and facing collectively here at Harvard.        606    00:44:27.665 --> 00:44:29.767    This year.        607    00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:32.369    It's the elephant in the room        608    00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:34.204    at every graduation in America.        609    00:44:34.204 --> 00:44:39.243    This spring, it's the crisis of the war    in Israel and Gaza.        610    00:44:39.543 --> 00:44:42.780    That has engulfed    so many university campuses.        611    00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:46.684    You know this far better than me.        612    00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:49.386    You've been here on campus.        613    00:44:49.386 --> 00:44:52.856    I've been 7000 miles away in China.        614    00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:57.161    I don't come here to be judge and jury.        615    00:44:57.194 --> 00:45:02.666    All I can offer today is a sense of my own    experience as a diplomat in dealing        616    00:45:03.734 --> 00:45:06.737    with difficult, emotional        617    00:45:07.771 --> 00:45:10.774    discussions about polarization,        618    00:45:11.275 --> 00:45:13.243    about injustice,        619    00:45:13.243 --> 00:45:16.480    about the tragedy that every life lost        620    00:45:17.347 --> 00:45:20.350    is a loss for humanity,        621    00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:23.854    about looking at both sides to a conflict.        622    00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:27.758    My profession of diplomacy        623    00:45:27.758 --> 00:45:31.328    is all about disagreement and debate        624    00:45:32.029 --> 00:45:35.032    and discussion and speech.        625    00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.836    If you think about the United Nations,    nearly        626    00:45:38.836 --> 00:45:42.906    every issue that comes to    the rostrum is a difficult issue.        627    00:45:42.906 --> 00:45:46.143    Where people are divided,    where nations are divided.        628    00:45:47.444 --> 00:45:49.613    And Professor O'Sullivan        629    00:45:49.613 --> 00:45:52.616    and I have been talking about this, and        630    00:45:53.784 --> 00:45:56.019    I think we agree we agree the other day        631    00:45:56.019 --> 00:45:59.256    that this process of learning    how to disagree,        632    00:46:00.924 --> 00:46:03.427    learning how to cope,        633    00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:05.329    learning how to reach out.        634    00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:07.631    That's a life skill.        635    00:46:07.631 --> 00:46:11.769    It's not something that you're just going    to have to process in practice. Now.        636    00:46:12.569 --> 00:46:15.472    It'll be part of your life forever more.        637    00:46:16.673 --> 00:46:18.609    So what are the lessons we might learn        638    00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:21.578    from the experience of this spring        639    00:46:22.312 --> 00:46:25.282    about how we move forward        640    00:46:25.282 --> 00:46:28.285    as a unified public?        641    00:46:29.086 --> 00:46:32.089    You now the adage from the Bible.        642    00:46:32.489 --> 00:46:34.525    Be slow to judge.        643    00:46:34.525 --> 00:46:37.127    Be quick to forgive.        644    00:46:37.127 --> 00:46:39.096    Speak your mind.        645    00:46:39.096 --> 00:46:41.331    Stand your ground.        646    00:46:41.331 --> 00:46:44.334    But listen as well as speak.        647    00:46:44.768 --> 00:46:47.704    Ask yourself    the question that I certainly don't ask.        648    00:46:47.704 --> 00:46:49.973    I think a lot of us don't.        649    00:46:49.973 --> 00:46:52.442    How might I be wrong?        650    00:46:52.442 --> 00:46:54.678    Are my assumptions correct?        651    00:46:54.678 --> 00:46:56.079    Are my facts correct?        652    00:46:56.079 --> 00:46:59.917    It's important    for people like me to ask those questions.        653    00:47:00.551 --> 00:47:03.520    In my line of work,        654    00:47:03.587 --> 00:47:06.256    find the humanity in the person    that you're arguing        655    00:47:06.256 --> 00:47:10.127    with, debating with maybe shouting at.        656    00:47:10.561 --> 00:47:13.697    There's a human being there you are to        657    00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:17.201    find more spaces at        658    00:47:17.201 --> 00:47:19.870    and around the country for diverse voices.        659    00:47:21.438 --> 00:47:22.606    Progressive,        660    00:47:22.606 --> 00:47:25.609    middle of the road, conservative.        661    00:47:25.976 --> 00:47:28.812    We're one country, not two.        662    00:47:28.812 --> 00:47:30.247    Not three.        663    00:47:30.247 --> 00:47:35.285    Listen to everybody and be civil    and be peaceful.        664    00:47:35.986 --> 00:47:38.989    And debate and discussion.        665    00:47:39.256 --> 00:47:42.726    One other way to look at this    and I know this is hard        666    00:47:43.727 --> 00:47:46.730    and I know it's been difficult this year        667    00:47:47.898 --> 00:47:50.601    that we're not the first generations        668    00:47:50.601 --> 00:47:53.604    of Americans and people around the world        669    00:47:53.804 --> 00:47:56.173    to contend with disagreement        670    00:47:56.173 --> 00:47:59.176    and to contend    with really difficult issues.        671    00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:04.147    In the wake of the Cuban Missile    Crisis, 1962, 63,        672    00:48:05.249 --> 00:48:08.418    when much of the world was at risk    of complete        673    00:48:08.919 --> 00:48:11.455    physical destruction.        674    00:48:11.455 --> 00:48:15.292    If a nuclear war had been fought in    October 1962,        675    00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.462    President Kennedy spent        676    00:48:18.462 --> 00:48:21.632    eight months    thinking about what had nearly happened,        677    00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:25.535    and he went to the American University    in June 1963.        678    00:48:26.169 --> 00:48:28.005    And here's what he said        679    00:48:29.139 --> 00:48:31.074    about about what happens when        680    00:48:31.074 --> 00:48:34.845    you demonize someone and what he was    saying to the American people.        681    00:48:34.845 --> 00:48:37.514    We've demonized the Soviet people.        682    00:48:37.514 --> 00:48:39.816    We've turned them into the enemy.        683    00:48:39.816 --> 00:48:42.019    Here's what he said.        684    00:48:42.019 --> 00:48:44.855    For in the final analysis,        685    00:48:44.855 --> 00:48:47.591    our most basic common link        686    00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:50.594    is that we all inhabit this small planet.        687    00:48:51.428 --> 00:48:54.431    We all breathe the same air.        688    00:48:55.098 --> 00:48:58.502    We all cherish our children's future.        689    00:48:59.102 --> 00:49:02.105    And we are all mortal.        690    00:49:02.506 --> 00:49:07.177    Wow. That those sentences are as relevant        691    00:49:07.177 --> 00:49:10.414    today as they were in 1963.        692    00:49:10.981 --> 00:49:12.516    They're insightful.        693    00:49:12.516 --> 00:49:15.485    And by the way,    if you look at granite posts        694    00:49:15.485 --> 00:49:18.522    all around John F Kennedy Park,    take a moment when you leave.        695    00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:20.924    You'll find that quote        696    00:49:20.924 --> 00:49:23.927    put there by Professor Allison    when he was Dean        697    00:49:24.461 --> 00:49:27.898    on one of our hallmarks here at Harvard    Kennedy School.        698    00:49:29.366 --> 00:49:31.034    So as you graduate tomorrow,        699    00:49:32.035 --> 00:49:35.439    consider how are you in small and big ways        700    00:49:35.973 --> 00:49:38.976    can be a force for civil discussion,        701    00:49:39.609 --> 00:49:42.579    civil debate in a democracy,        702    00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:47.818    can you be a force for unity    in a world that somehow, sometimes        703    00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:52.089    it appears, just wants to divide    and even disintegrate?        704    00:49:52.422 --> 00:49:55.659    Be that voice for compassion, learning,        705    00:49:55.892 --> 00:49:58.895    understanding and unity?        706    00:49:59.062 --> 00:50:01.298    And because Libby wants us        707    00:50:01.298 --> 00:50:04.267    to focus on hope and she's right.        708    00:50:04.868 --> 00:50:07.838    The final thing I want to say to you    today is this.        709    00:50:09.139 --> 00:50:12.309    I'm Irish-American, as is Professor    O'Sullivan,        710    00:50:12.776 --> 00:50:16.380    as his eyes are Libby    and Elizabeth Burns, our daughter,        711    00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:22.019    one of our greatest modern poets    in Ireland, is Seamus Heaney.        712    00:50:22.052 --> 00:50:23.720    He taught here.        713    00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.889    He was a professor at Harvard.        714    00:50:25.889 --> 00:50:29.860    He wrote a poem called The Cure of Troy    in 1991.        715    00:50:30.527 --> 00:50:32.295    Is my favorite poet.        716    00:50:32.295 --> 00:50:35.298    More importantly, he's    Joe Biden's favorite poet.        717    00:50:35.665 --> 00:50:39.069    Here's what he said    about the future and about how        718    00:50:40.337 --> 00:50:41.571    history says        719    00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:44.574    don't hope on this side of the grave.        720    00:50:45.509 --> 00:50:48.378    But then, once in a lifetime,        721    00:50:48.378 --> 00:50:52.482    the longed for tidal    wave of justice can rise up        722    00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:56.620    and hope and history rhyme.        723    00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.723    Harvard Kennedy School Class of 2024.        724    00:51:00.524 --> 00:51:03.527    Please give us hope.        725    00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:04.461    Thank you.        726    00:51:04.461 --> 00:51:07.464    And congratulations to all of you.        727    00:51:41.531 --> 00:51:41.998    Thank you.        728    00:51:41.998 --> 00:51:45.836    Ambassador Burns,    I know that your words will guide        729    00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:50.440    and inspire the class of 2024    as they find their way in the world.        730    00:51:51.341 --> 00:51:55.045    To all of the graduates and their families    and friends, I look forward        731    00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:59.449    to seeing you here tomorrow    for the Kennedy School diplomas ceremony.        732    00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:01.284    Thank you very much.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.920    a doctor my mom set my hand on        10    00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.960    fire after wrapping my hand with several        11    00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.079    Nils of cotton the then soaking it in        12    00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.360    wine she put a chopstick into my mouth        13    00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.159    and ignited the        14

serum pan made me want to scream but the        17    00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.880    Chopstick prevented it all I could do        18    00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.479    was watch my hand        19

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.320    you see the part of China I grew up in        23    00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.119    was a rural Village and at that time        24    00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.439    pre-industrial when I was born my        25    00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.799    Village had no cars no telephones no        26    00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.960    electricity not even running water and        27    00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.680    we certainly didn't have access to        28    00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.960    Modern medical        29    00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.200

basic biochemistry isn't        37    00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.120    it but I'm a PhD student in Biochemistry        38    00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.040    at        39    00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.480    Harvard I now know that better less        40    00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.000    painful and less risky treatments        41    00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.720    existed so        42    00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.560    I can't help but ask        43    00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.720    myself why I didn't receive one at the        44    00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.560    time 15 years have passed since that        45    00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.120    incident I'm happy to report that my        46    00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.720    hand is        47    00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.080    fine but this question lingers and are        48    00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.760    continue to be troubled by the unequal        49    00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.640    distribution of scientific knowledge        50    00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.879    throughout the        51    00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.599    world we have learned to addit the human        52    00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:00.680    dream        53    00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.920    and unlock many secrets of how cancer        54    00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.400    progresses we can manipulate neuronal        55    00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.599    activity literally with the switch of        56    00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.360    light each year brings more advances in        57    00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.720    biomedical research exciting        58    00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.480    transformative        59    00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.959    accomplishments yet despite the        60    00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.640    knowledge we have amassed we haven't        61    00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.239    been so successful in deploying it to        62    00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.560    where is needed        63    00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.239    most according to the World Bank 12 per        64    00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.239    of the world population lives on less        65

300 million people are        68    00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.400    afflicted by malaria        69    00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.040    globally all over the world we        70    00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.040    constantly see these problems of poverty        71    00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.159    illness and lack of resources impeding        72    00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.040    the flow of scientific        73    00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.280    information life- saving knowledge we        74    00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.799    take for granted in our modern world is        75    00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.319    often unavailable in these        76    00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.959    underdeveloped        77    00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.599    regions and so in far too many places        78    00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.959    people still essentially trying to cill        79    00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.360    a spider bite with        80    00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.160    fire while studying at Harvard I saw how        81    00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.639    scientific knowledge can help others in        82    00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.080    simple yet profound        83    00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.919    ways the bird flu pandemic in the 2000s        84    00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.320    looked to my Village like a spell cast        85    00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.080    by demons        86    00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.440    our folk medicine didn't even have half        87    00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.759    mess to        88    00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:37.240    offer once more Farmers didn't know the        89    00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.080    difference between common cold and flu        90    00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.160    they didn't understand that the flu was        91    00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.280    much more lethal than common cold most        92    00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.600    were also unaware that the virus could        93    00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.400    transmit across different animal        94    00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.120    species so when I realized that simple        95    00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.199    hygiene practices like separating        96    00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.320    different animal species could help        97    00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.680    contain the spread of disease and that I        98    00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.600    could help make this knowledge available        99    00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.680    to my        100    00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.080    Village that was my first aha moment as        101    00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.840    a b in        102    00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.160    scientist but it was more than that it        103    00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.880    was also a vital inflection point of my        104    00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.440    own ethical development my own self-        105    00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.080    understanding as a member of the global        106    00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.400    Community Howard dares us to dream big        107    00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.960    to Aspire to change the world he here on        108    00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.759    this commencement day we are probably        109    00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.800    thinking of the grand destinations and        110    00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.080    Big Adventures that await        111    00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.479    us as for me I'm also thinking of the        112    00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.000    farmers in my        113    00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.840    Village my experience here reminds me        114    00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.199    how important it is for researchers to        115    00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.360    communicate our knowledge to those who        116    00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.280    need it because by using the science we        117    00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.400    already have we could probably bring        118    00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.280    myage and thousands like it into the        119    00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.240    world you and I take for granted every        120    00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.199    day and that's an impact every one of us        121    00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.479    can        122    00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.440    make but the question is will we make        123    00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.720    the effort or        124    00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.280    not more than ever before our society        125    00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.240    emphasizes science and Innovation but an        126    00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.440    equally important emphasis should be on        127    00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.639    Distributing the knowledge we have to        128    00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.599    those who need it changing the world        129    00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:34.880    doesn't mean everyone has to find the        130    00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.880    next big thing it can be a simple as        131    00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.160    becoming better communicators and        132    00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.400    finding more creative ways to pass on        133    00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.400    the knowledge we have to people like my        134    00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.960    mom and the farmers in the local        135    00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.800    community our society also needs to        136    00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.199    recognize that the equal distribution of        137    00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:55.000    knowledge is a pivotal step of human        138    00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.599    development and we'll work to bring this        139    00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:00.160    into reality        140    00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.000    and if we do that then perhaps a        141    00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.520    teenager in rural China who is beaten by        142    00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.759    a poisonous spider will no longer have        143    00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:10.680    to burn his hand but we know to seek a        144    00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.080    doctor        145    00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.560    instead thank you        146    00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.639    [Applause]        147    00:07:25.900

--> 00:01:14.920    home it could still happen though so        28    00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.799    don't get cocky okay don't turn that        29    00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.560    room into a home gym        30    00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.360    yet when I first got the call to be the        31    00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.119    class day speaker I was touched and        32    00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.240    thrilled and I swelled with pride of        33    00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.960    course that call came in 2011 and they        34    00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.400    only called me because they needed me to        35    00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.720    forward the request to Amy        36    00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.079    polar but this year when I got the call        37    00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.200    I had the same reaction I had when I was        38    00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.640    accepted to Harvard wow a bunch of        39    00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.399    people said no and they had to go to the        40    00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.759    waiting list that's true I was on the        41    00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.880    waiting        42    00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.880    list nonetheless this is a dream come        43    00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.399    true so thank you for allowing me to be        44    00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.600    here        45    00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.119    today I graduated from the esteemed        46    00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.320    establishment in        47    00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.560    1997 19 years ago I was right where you        48    00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.719    are I was poised to receive the highest        49    00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.200    Collegiate honor in the world so        50    00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.800    naturally I slept through my alarm and        51    00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.160    was woken up by my boyfriend's roommate        52    00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.120    panicked and hung over I checked my        53    00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.599    pager that was cutting edge back then by        54    00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.319    the way and as I bolted to the yard I        55    00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.519    threw on my cap and gown like I was in a        56    00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.519    John Hughes movie and made it just in        57    00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.080    time for commencement I wish I could say        58    00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.599    a lot has changed since then fortunately        59    00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.400    the exact same montage laed out this        60    00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.720    morning minus the cap and gown plus a        61    00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.440    newly chronic knee problem which slowed        62    00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.280    me down and obviously I have a much        63    00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.239    nicer pager        64    00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.200    now just standing here in Harvard Yard I        65    00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.280    can easily transport myself back in time        66    00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.080    I made so many wonderful memories here        67    00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.720    on this campus that will last a lifetime        68    00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.000    taking a

00:09:19.079 --> 00:09:21.440    weren't true why wouldn't you have        230    00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.240    chosen to go to        231    00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.000    Stanford where the weather is sick and        232    00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.320    it's right next door to Silicon Valley        233    00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.800    and you could have just used student        234    00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.560    population as beta testers for some        235    00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.519    awesome new app and then sold it right        236    00:09:33.519 -->

chose to graduate from it        239    00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.120    no one successful graduates from Harvard        240    00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.720    as mentioned Matt Damon William Randolph        241    00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.440    Hurst Bonnie rate Bill Gates Mark        242    00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.640    Zuckerberg dropouts can you name anyone        243

00:09:59.680    example of a successful person that        246    00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.240    graduated from        247    00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.560    Harvard but Rashida you may ask what

253    00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.120    doesn't mean you can't fix it you're        254    00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.720    young you have time you're thinking I'm        255    00:10:20.720 -->

Vape hits later 20 years        258    00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.079    years will have passed and you will be        259    00:10:31.079 --> 00:10:33.360    asking yourself giant questions about        260    00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.320    work life balance priorities and passion        261    00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.639    meaning and direction and you will be        262    00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:40.680    both empowered and constrained by the        263    00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.440    choices you make and the ones you don't        264    00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.399    make the minute you walk out of this        265    00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:48.040    yard so my self-imposed job today is to        266    00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.040    spare you from the midlife crisis that        267    00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.519    is silently and patiently waiting for        268    00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:55.240    you in your 40s this may not sound like        269    00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.279    a pressing issue today as you prepare to        270    00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:58.600    ENT enter the land of adult        271    00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.240    responsibility but every move you make        272    00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.560    from now on is creating the map the        273    00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.120    foundation on which you build upon for        274    00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.480    your whole life it's crucial that you        275    00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.360    start thinking about how you're going to        276    00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.839    avoid getting your first tattoo at        277    00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:14.240    45 so before you glaze over I'd like to        278    00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.160    offer three simple pieces of advice one        279    00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.200    don't count on the system two protect        280    00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.480    your instinct to care and three choose        281    00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.040    love one don't count on the system        282    00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.360    you're here you did it you're graduating        283    00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.279    from Harvard after four years of        284    00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:32.480    determination and studying your nuts off        285    00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.880    you finally crossed the Finish Line you        286    00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.279    got here because you're a rule follower        287    00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:39.240    and that's great you trusted in the        288    00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.800    system and the system rewarded you you        289    00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.519    did all the right things you were the        290    00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:45.279    star of your high school you got the        291    00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:46.880    grades you were in all the curric        292    00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.279    extracurricular activities you Charmed        293    00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:51.000    the teachers and you duped the Harvard        294    00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.200    admissions team by greatly exaggerating        295    00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.600    how much you learned on your 3-day        296    00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.560    volunteer trip to        297    00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.800    Haiti I know this because I'm just like        298    00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.200    you I told my parents when I was four        299    00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.079    that I wanted to go to Harvard I        300    00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:05.959    recognized that on the path to getting        301    00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:07.880    there there were concrete linear steps        302    00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.399    to be executed and I loved the inherent        303    00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:13.000    structure in that I respected Authority        304    00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.720    I trusted in the system I really liked        305    00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.680    those walk and don't walk        306    00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.440    signs I believe that I would always find        307    00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.800    wise experienced people at the helm of        308    00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.480    well-run and fair Enterprises and that        309    00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.160    these people would exercise power and        310    00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.440    distribute opportunity with        311    00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.760    thoughtfulness and nobility and that I        312    00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.399    couldn't possibly understand the        313    00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:34.399    complexities of their process there        314    00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:35.959    would always be a collective that would        315    00:12:35.959 --> 00:12:38.079    know more than I and even if I didn't        316    00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:39.839    have empirical proof that I should trust        317    00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:42.199    in them fully and wholly I just had to        318    00:12:42.199 --> 00:12:43.880    because that's just the way things        319    00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.920    worked after        320    00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.120    graduating I spent the next 10 years        321    00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.680    enjoying a decent amount of success as        322    00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.160    an actress I could support myself which        323    00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.040    in an overcrowded UNM meritocratic        324    00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.240    system like Hollywood is a big        325    00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.800    accomplishment fast forward TW to 20 7        326    00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.279    where I found myself in a bit of a rut I        327    00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:04.120    just come off a great year-long stint        328    00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.120    guest starring on The Office my biggest        329    00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.079    break to date but once again I was back        330    00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:11.360    to pounding the pavement auditioning for        331    00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.600    movies and TV and with the threat of an        332    00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.040    upcoming writer strike there wasn't a        333    00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.600    ton of production so there wasn't a ton        334    00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.680    of auditions and the stuff I was going        335    00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.680    in on for was the wife The Sassy best        336    00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.199    friend the girlfriend you know your        337    00:13:23.199 --> 00:13:24.480    run-of-the-mill two dimensional        338    00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.040    supporting female parts as the dry spell        339    00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.760    continued I found myself increasingly        340    00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.399    deor moralized and frustrated I had        341    00:13:31.399 --> 00:13:33.320    always wanted to write but felt too        342    00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.120    daunted by the task and being surrounded        343    00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.040    by talented professional writer friends        344    00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.240    didn't really help it felt silly to        345    00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.880    start Down A New Path in my 30s but I        346    00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.760    channeled my frustrated unemployed        347    00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.600    energy and with my best friend will        348    00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.720    McCormick we sat down every day for six        349    00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.320    months until we had completed a movie        350    00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.560    script it was called Celeste and Jesse        351    00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.800    Forever and we sold it in a bidding war        352    00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.959    of fox Atomic which is a subsidiary of        353    00:13:56.959 --> 00:13:59.160    fox they wanted to make the movie for        354    00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.360    $16 million we did it it was the        355    00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.920    greatest accomplishment of my life I        356    00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.040    circumvented the system and then the        357    00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.320    system changed a month later Fox Atomic        358    00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.720    folded and then began a two-year journey        359    00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.759    of watching my script go down with the        360    00:14:15.759 --> 00:14:17.759    whole business of major Studios making        361    00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:19.720    smaller films the ones that are neither        362    00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.279    big budget franchise nor tiny        363    00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:23.759    Independents we sold our script again to        364    00:14:23.759 --> 00:14:25.600    another company and they folded 6 months        365    00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.000    later we sold it to another company they        366    00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.519    folded then yet another film financing        367    00:14:30.519 --> 00:14:33.079    company who wanted to make it folded we        368    00:14:33.079 --> 00:14:35.959    were shutting down companies all over        369    00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:38.959    town finally we realized that with the        370    00:14:38.959 --> 00:14:41.320    old system crumbling we had to find        371    00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.720    another way we now had a very short        372    00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.480    window that was slowly closing I        373    00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.279    couldn't if I couldn't find financing        374    00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:49.480    and start filming in a month I would        375    00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.519    lose my actors my crew my director and        376    00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:55.320    probably my mind I had called in every        377    00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.440    favor from everyone I knew I had put        378    00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.560    everything on the line so we said screw        379    00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.399    it let's just make this movie however we        380    00:15:01.399 --> 00:15:04.440    can we got lucky and found an investor        381    00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.440    thank you for Everly Nelson and made the        382    00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.639    movie for $840,000        383    00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:11.079    now that might sound like a lot of money        384    00:15:11.079 --> 00:15:14.120    I mean $840,000 is almost a year of        385    00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.160    Harvard        386    00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.120    tuition but in the film business it's        387    00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.000    peanuts we sold the film at Sundance had        388    00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.839    some pretty nice reviews and got an        389    00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:24.800    independent Spirit award nomination for        390    00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.720    writing launching my writing and        391    00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.800    producing career felt like a milestone        392    00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.480    but but more importantly I overcame my        393    00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.279    own compulsion to work within the system        394    00:15:34.279 --> 00:15:36.279    even after 40 years I have a hard time        395    00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:38.240    accepting that the people in charge are        396    00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.600    not always the most competent now I'm a        397    00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.639    realist I work for myself if I hit a        398    00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:46.360    wall I look for ways outside the system        399    00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.000    to get things        400    00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.279    done the hard fact is this the real        401    00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:53.759    world doesn't reward rule followers the        402    00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:56.000    way the educational world does and the        403    00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.600    real world is not always Merit based the        404    00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.839    instit tions and organizations we yield        405    00:16:00.839 --> 00:16:03.480    to and Trust in to support our success        406    00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.480    whether they be employers or government        407    00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.839    are flawed they have objectives that        408    00:16:07.839 --> 00:16:10.199    will most likely conflict with our own        409    00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:11.880    I'm not suggesting you should act on        410    00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.800    your own self-interest but be on guard        411    00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.440    be agnostic don't just follow the rules        412    00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.079    and assume everything works out because        413    00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:21.160    it's happened that way in the past just        414    00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.440    because they've been doing it a long        415    00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.560    time does not mean it's right in fact        416    00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.680    historial historical precedents and        417    00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.440    traditions are often br rming with        418    00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.199    Injustice and racism and sexism yes        419    00:16:33.199 --> 00:16:35.440    Hasty Pudding theatricals I'm talking to        420    00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.079    you I think it's time to break tradition        421    00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:43.079    and let girls in your show right it's        422    00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.160    time speaking of change at Harvard        423    00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.959    there's been a lot of wonderful advances        424    00:16:48.959 --> 00:16:51.160    even since the time I graduated back        425    00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.519    then Harvard had not even had a a woman        426    00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:56.920    is President and a black Jewish female        427    00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.920    class day speaker is with you today so        428    00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.680    that's a little more history I also        429    00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.360    understand that the final clubs are now        430    00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.640    facing pressure to admit women including        431    00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.720    the notorious porcelan Club the rumor we        432    00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.760    always heard was that the porcelan would        433    00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.199    give $1 million to any alumnus who        434    00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:16.520    wasn't already a millionaire by age 40        435    00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.439    that's awesome if it's true so if they        436    00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:21.959    start admitting women let's see what's        437    00:17:21.959 --> 00:17:27.079    79% of a million anybody know no okay        438    00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.000    but back to you in add in addition to        439    00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.280    other benefits unlearning your rule        440    00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.880    following instincts will allow you to        441    00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.000    get to know yourself in a real way for        442    00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.360    the last four years your identity has        443    00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.679    been wrapped up in this institution and        444    00:17:40.679 --> 00:17:42.280    look how proud you made the people        445    00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.679    around you but what about you outside of        446    00:17:45.679 --> 00:17:48.000    what's expected from you what path do        447    00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.080    you really want to take in life what are        448    00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.280    you prepared to tolerate to realize that        449    00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.480    path or are you waiting for someone else        450    00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.400    to Define that path for you as a fellow        451    00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.400    rule follower I can also tell you that        452    00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.240    it's very painful when the things you        453    00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.360    believe in start to show their cracks        454    00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.039    and their imperfections no job or        455    00:18:06.039 --> 00:18:08.880    employer or Mentor will all ever be the        456    00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.320    answer you want them to be I spent my        457    00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.000    younger years hoping and praying that        458    00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.520    someone would give me a break that        459    00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.679    someone more successful and        460    00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.520    knowledgeable than I would show me the        461    00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.440    way and save me from making mistakes but        462    00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.559    everyone is dealing with their own flaws        463    00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:24.720    and egos don't get me wrong I've been        464    00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.080    lucky enough to work with some        465

kind of        494    00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.840    responsibility a couple of years ago in        495    00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.679    expressing concern about the worldwide        496    00:19:36.679 --> 00:19:38.679    policies towards the ongoing Refugee        497    00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:41.320    crisis Pope Francis coined the phrase        498    00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.640    the globalization of indifference        499    00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.240    indifference is an Insidious and toxic        500    00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.600    State of Mind for your

00:19:59.440    that        506    00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.200    unfortunately the world you've inherited        507    00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.039    is beat down and polarized and fraught        508    00:20:04.039 --> 00:20:07.200    with conflict we as humans are not great        509    00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.799    at learning from our Collective mistakes        510    00:20:09.799 --> 00:20:12.440    but it's nothing we can't recover from        511    00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.080    it will take a generation of compassion        512    00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.880    and empathy and action to make it happen        513    00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.000    and that's where you come in having        514    00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.880    compassion and focus is becoming        515    00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.559    increasingly more difficult in the        516    00:20:23.559 --> 00:20:25.760    information age because there's a lot of        517    00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.799    information it's hard to care about        518    00:20:27.799 --> 00:20:29.200    something for very long because before        519    00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.880    you know it there's an even newer        520    00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.679    breaking news story or the ding of an        521    00:20:32.679 --> 00:20:34.919    email or a Facebook notification begging

person you were obligated        548    00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.360    to be loud to rise above the        549    00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.600    fear-mongering and bigotry and        550    00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.760    misinformation to make yourself heard        551    00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.880    through all the noise and you can be        552    00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.039    heard it's        553    00:21:48.039 --> 00:21:50.760    possible the way to really be heard is        554    00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.039    to do even more than you        555    00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:55.400    say people tend to find it a little        556    00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.200    Annoying for celebrities to be vocal        557    00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.880    about politics and I get it I know I'm        558    00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.159    an actress I'm not a world leader and        559    00:22:02.159 --> 00:22:03.960    the line of reasoning is these bright        560    00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.039    shiny objects get more airtime not        561    00:22:06.039 --> 00:22:07.320    because they're more informed or they're        562    00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.919    any smarter but just because they played        563    00:22:08.919 --> 00:22:10.760    some badass hero in a movie and they        564    00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.080    think they know everything I've often        565    00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.200    been told by trolls to stick to acting        566    00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.200    or to shut up because I'm a stupid        567    00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.880    celebrity but you know what I don't care        568    00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.799    I don't care there's two much to fight        569    00:22:23.799 --> 00:22:26.799    for the equality and respect that people        570    00:22:26.799 --> 00:22:29.039    before us have fought for and the laws        571    00:22:29.039 --> 00:22:31.320    put in place to protect these things are        572    00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.720    at risk of slipping away young unarmed        573    00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.799    black men are being killed in record        574    00:22:36.799 --> 00:22:39.039    numbers states are passing laws that are        575    00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:40.600    systematically stripping away women's        576    00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.640    Reproductive Rights a presidential        577    00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.600    candidate is encouraging his supporters        578    00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.760    to be violent and racist and wants to        579    00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.960    ensure that there are no gunfree zones        580    00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.520    in this country while we're distracted        581    00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.480    with pretty Instagram shots of coffee        582    00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.159    and celebrity breakups our freedoms are        583    00:22:56.159 --> 00:22:59.360    at risk of slipping away and to me this        584    00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.400    issue is more important than smiling        585    00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.840    pretty and talking about how much fun I        586    00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.360    had on a movie set I am aware this could        587    00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.760    make me unlikable I'm aware that being        588    00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.320    political could open me up to criticism        589    00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.000    and look every one of us wants to be        590    00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.120    liked it sucks to have people say awful        591    00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.919    things about you I mean no human is        592    00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:17.520    immune to that except maybe Donald Trump        593    00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.120    I'm not sure I human so we'll        594    00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.760    see all this to say care about what        595    00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.600    matters to you and don't let complacency        596    00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.200    or feeling overwhelmed or the haters        597    00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.720    distract you from this it's too        598    00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.520    important as my dear friend who I've        599    00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.039    never met before DJ colled says they        600    00:23:38.039 --> 00:23:41.760    don't want you to win so you have to win        601    00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.840    by caring that's what he means when he        602    00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.960    says win he wants you to care I want you        603    00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.960    to care whatever you know what I mean        604    00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.679    protect your instinct to care choose        605    00:23:50.679 --> 00:23:53.679    love my dad has given me some remarkable        606    00:23:53.679 --> 00:23:56.240    advice over the years actually just a        607    00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.880    couple hours ago he said something        608    00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.799    profound he said honey in your speech        609    00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:02.840    today make sure you mention my        610    00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.400    remarkable        611    00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.120    advice he has told me you can't get an A        612    00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.080    if you're afraid of getting an F he has        613    00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.279    told me to approach work with humility        614    00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:14.840    and Grace because I'm really just a        615    00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.240    conduit for a higher power he has told        616    00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.520    me to live every day like it's your last        617    00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.440    and one day you'll be right a piece of        618    00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.159    advice that becomes scarily more        619    00:24:23.159 --> 00:24:26.039    meaningful to me as the older I get but        620    00:24:26.039 --> 00:24:28.399    maybe the best advice he's ever given me        621    00:24:28.399 --> 00:24:30.960    is to live in love and not fear it        622    00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.799    sounded like a parental platitude when I        623    00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:34.880    first heard it but then I started to        624    00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.679    apply that Paradigm to every decision I        625    00:24:36.679 --> 00:24:39.600    made all of a sudden I was asking myself        626    00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.200    where my decision- making was coming        627    00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.559    from was I scared to disappoint people        628    00:24:43.559 --> 00:24:45.640    was I scared to fail was I scared I        629    00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.480    wasn't up to the task or was I excited        630    00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.760    and nervous about the unknown did I        631    00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.760    picture myself possibly pushing past        632    00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.360    what I thought my limitations were we        633    00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.799    have to consciously choose love because        634    00:24:57.799 --> 00:24:59.000    it's scary        635    00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000    choosing love is not always the easiest        636    00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.880    answer and it doesn't always put you on        637    00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.360    the clearest path choosing love is        638    00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.360    inexorably tied to taking risk and what        639    00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.200    this actually means to you I can't ever        640    00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.919    know because it's different for everyone        641    00:25:12.919 --> 00:25:15.200    what you love is so personal what        642    00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.960    inspires you what makes you tick so I        643    00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.080    can only say when big decisions pop up        644    00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:25.320    get quiet real quiet and listen turn off        645    00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.880    your phone turn off your computer and        646    00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.679    listen to to your true heart hear the        647    00:25:30.679 --> 00:25:32.440    thing that makes you feel sick with        648    00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.600    excitement and scares you because you        649    00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.399    know you'll learn and do that        650    00:25:37.399 --> 00:25:39.760    thing so just to review because I think        651    00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.320    maybe some of you are hung over or maybe        652    00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.679    have been asleep for a little bit here's        653    00:25:43.679 -->

00:01:19.439    gym and in this point in my failed        25    00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.119    Endeavors to start writing I've grown        26    00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.200    rather fond of this little pet        27    00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.680    squirrel I haven't named        28    00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.280    him        29    00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.079    bubbles but then in the blink think of        30    00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.119    an I I've got 24 hours to finish 12        31    00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.079    pages in The Rise of socialism in late        32    00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.600    19th century Poland and I'm freaking out        33    00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.079    but you know the drill maybe bubbles my        34    00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.079    optimistic pet squirrel who's caused all        35    00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:43.799    this anxiety and stress maybe he has        36    00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.560    something encouraging to say right        37    00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.799    bubbles B bu        38    00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.280    bubbles where are you        39    00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.240    bubbles we all procrastinate right        40    00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.119    procrastination is as vital to the        41    00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.680    Harvard students life as water is to        42    00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.200    fish or as lotteries are to Harvard        43    00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.520    classes so why do we        44    00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.400    procrastinate according to highly        45    00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.080    reputable news source busy.com        46    00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.920    we procrastinate because we want to        47    00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.480    escape the traumatic pain that comes        48    00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.599    with the task that we are supposed to be        49    00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.400    doing to all your thesis survivors it's        50    00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.720    okay your thesis won't find you here        51    00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.560    when I was a freshman the upper classman        52    00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.920    I knew would always tell me focus on the        53    00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.120    people here apparently if there was one        54    00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.480    thing they regretted doing it was        55    00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.120    spending too much time grinding away        56    00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.280    pets and not enough time hanging out        57    00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.920    with friends so I took their advice to        58    00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.599    heart I shouldn't spend time on pets        59    00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.280    fine with me I'll be an English        60    00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.440    major no pets ever except for        61    00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.920    spu so after after a turbulent freshman        62    00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.760    year in which I juggled school with        63    00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.840    sports a series of first world        64    00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.400    existential        65    00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.360    crises I found myself sophomore year        66    00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.159    when I decided I wanted to        67    00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.400    become a people        68    00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.840    person now for context in high school I        69    00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.239    was so busy focusing on me that I didn't        70    00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.680    even know what hangout meant on top of        71    00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.560    that I was an only child who spent much        72    00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.400    of his formative years swimming one of        73    00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.239    the most individualistic and antisocial        74    00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.519    of        75    00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.040    sports so when I decided I wanted to        76    00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.879    become this people person it was pretty        77    00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.799    nerve-wracking because in order to be a        78    00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:35.680    people        79    00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.280    person you need        80    00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.560    people people are        81    00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.760    weird and I'm pretty weird but I didn't        82    00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.159    know if other people's kind of weird        83    00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.239    wanted to hang out with my kind of        84    00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.720    weird but as it turns out you all are        85    00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.200    friendly and soon enough as I began        86    00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.120    choosing to hang out with my friends        87    00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.799    rather than study the term people person        88    00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:58.720    became a        89    00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.720    euphemism for professional        90    00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.720    procrastinator I've spent the last three        91    00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.200    years at Harvard spending entire days        92    00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.840    forgoing my personal work only to give        93    00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.680    in to the Sweet temptation of hanging        94    00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.120    out with the people around me I remember        95    00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.040    multiple occasions just freestyling with        96    00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.040    my buddy Steven until 3:00 a.m. in the        97    00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.160    morning just Hing a lot because I'm not        98    00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.759    a very good        99    00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:26.639    rapper people I like to say are my fifth        100    00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.720    class which is also saying a lot cuz I        101    00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.039    would never take five classes here at        102    00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.759    Harvard I'd moved from one conversation        103    00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:37.840    in D Hall to another in the common room        104    00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.240    mesmerized by my peers talks of their        105    00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.560    past travels their current research        106    00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.680    proposals and their determined dreams to        107    00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.520    change the world in one particular        108    00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.840    conversation Pat a good friend of mine        109    00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.520    told me that he wanted to use statistics        110    00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.199    to change the world and that his dream        111    00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.759    is a somay positively affect 1 billion        112    00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.360    people and sure enough this past winter        113    00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.160    break P got started on that dream when        114    00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.840    in the wake of Nepal's catastrophic        115    00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.880    earthquakes he and his roommate decided        116    00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.280    to travel to Nepal to conduct database        117    00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.400    research to help improve disaster relief        118    00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.400    efforts there exchanges like this both        119    00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.919    fascinated me and left me in awe sure at        120    00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.520    the end of these conversation fill days        121    00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.280    I'd find myself back at my desk in my        122    00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.680    room having started none of the        123    00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.800    assignments or readings due the next        124    00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.880    morning but I'd feel incredibly rich and        125    00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.120    satisfied because I had learned so much        126    00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.800    about the people around me as if you all        127    00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.280    will one big story book come        128    00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.080    alive and guess what professionally        129    00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.319    procrastinating my way through college        130    00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:42.840    must have paid off somehow I am one of        131    00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.440    the few English concentrators to        132    00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.600    graduate from my department with a        133    00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.639    job and by job I mean        134    00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.840    internship        135    00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.520    and by internship I actually mean two        136    00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.440    months of shredding paper getting coffee        137    00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.639    and sharpening pencils all the things my        138    00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.840    English degree prepared me        139    00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.479    for but professionally procrastinating        140    00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:15.680    my way through college wasn't always        141    00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.520    just fun in games though I spend entire        142    00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.639    afternoons or evenings talking with the        143    00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:23.280    brightest funniest the most insightful        144    00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.039    people I have the Blessed opportunity to        145    00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.840    call classmates at the same        146    00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.440    time i' ironically feel like a shell of        147    00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.440    a person as if I lacked an Essence that        148    00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.319    made me me like there was no substance        149    00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:40.440    to who I        150    00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.759    was and in my efforts to be more        151    00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:45.840    sociable I realized what was really        152    00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.080    scary was not the prospect of being        153    00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.000    rejected by        154    00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.880    people what was really scary was feeling        155    00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.080    alone and        156    00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.879    incompetent even while being around        157    00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:01.080    people I considered friends        158    00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.319    after 45 minutes of delightful dialogue        159    00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:05.759    it would be my peers peers who would        160    00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.560    have to check their watches and head off        161    00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.879    to a class or meeting or the library and        162    00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:14.520    I felt like it was my peers not me who        163    00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.240    were diligent focused enough to take        164    00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.919    School seriously make an impact in this        165    00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:24.000    world and I think we've all felt that        166    00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.639    way one time or        167    00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:30.160    Another Empty somehow        168    00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.800    worth less because of just how amazing        169    00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.599    our fellow classmates can be there's        170    00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:37.560    this unspoken self-consciousness that        171    00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.160    pervades this unintentional belittling        172    00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.960    of ourselves that we're not as        173    00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.240    accomplished or as mature as we thought        174    00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.720    we'd be after four years here at        175    00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.960    Harvard and I think it's safe to assume        176    00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.599    that most of us have wondered even if we        177    00:07:52.599 --> 00:07:53.919    trust a        178    00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:58.120    moment am I Harvard's a mission        179    00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.720    mistake I know I've worried about        180    00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.319    that the same time as I stand here today        181    00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:09.560    reexamining how I use every moment of my        182    00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.000    precious time here at Harvard I don't        183    00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.080    regret a        184    00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.159    thing sure I might not be the most        185    00:08:15.159 --> 00:08:16.879    impressive student here with the best        186    00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:18.960    GPA or the most stunning        187    00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.840    accolades but what I do have is a        188    00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.680    collection of experiences derived simply        189    00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.120    from talking with other people and I        190    00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.720    think that's what Harvard is about cuz        191    00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.560    of more time procrastinating means that        192    00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.680    you had an intense heart tohe heart with        193    00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.719    your two other roommates and maybe that        194    00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:37.120    inefficient cramming later on was worth        195    00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.919    it I'm more driven now to do something        196    00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.919    to be someone to change the world to        197    00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.720    leave an impact than I've ever been        198    00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.880    before precisely because of how I've        199    00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.320    been shaped and fueled by all of your        200    00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.480    stories and unlike the section readings        201    00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.680    I didn't do for my        202    00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.800    classes I'll actually remember your        203    00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.440    stories a decade or two from        204    00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.279    now whatever Pathways we embark work on        205    00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:02.240    one thing is for sure we'll always face        206    00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.839    trade-offs trying to find the perfect        207    00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:06.800    balance between focusing on our own work        208    00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.240    and engaging with other people and at        209    00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.200    these Crossroads there will be a voice        210    00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.440    inside of our        211    00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.959    heads now whether that voice manifests        212    00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:17.800    itself as your conscience on the form of        213    00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.000    an optimistic pet squirrel is not the        214    00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.360    point what matters is that we listen to        215    00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.079    that voice and that we take the time to        216    00:09:27.079 --> 00:09:29.680    consider the unexpected Valu that we        217    00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.160    might learn from the people around        218    00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:38.839    us so to to the graduating class of        219    00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.760    2016 I have a pet        220    00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.120    squirrel and he lives in my        221    00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.399    head and I hope he continues to live        222    00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:54.160    there for a long long time thank        223    00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.320    you

00:03:01.410    this is my third graduation speech if        47    00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.940    you don't count the one I gave in high        48    00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.160    school and I would ask as a favor that        49    00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.750    you please not count the one I gave in        50    00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.480    high school my first year as Dean I gave        51    00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.130    a speech about time and last year I        52    00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.410    talked about sin when people started        53    00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.000    asking me what I would talk about this        54    00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.500    year are usually just replied that's a        55    00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.270    good question and then I finally        56    00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.010    realized well that's a lame answer but        57    00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.050    it's actually a good topic for a speech        58    00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.750    so today I'd like to talk with you about        59    00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.790    the beauty and power of good questions        60    00:03:26.790 -->

65    00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.890    answer to which is I did next year I        66    00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.180    plan to talk about the importance of        67    00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.510    using good titles for speeches before we        68    00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.070    get to the question phase of this talk        69    00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.810    I'd like to

hall anyway and they proved        89    00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.979    somewhat reluctant to leave for the        90    00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.240    parents in the audience we're pretty        91    00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.020    sure they're gone we walked a few steps        92    00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.820    closer toward fulfilling the promise of        93    00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.070    diversity while at the same time        94    00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.060    appreciating even more that this is a        95    00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.940    long journey all of you our students        96    00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.830    were as active and inspiring as ever        97    00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.720    inside the classroom and outside of it        98

00:05:47.280    letters euphy sit on the mashed potato        113    00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.250    bar and Guttman and you washed it all        114    00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.780    down with roughly three hundred and        115    00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.220    seventy two gallons of free coffee        116    00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.600    outside of Appian Way we witnessed a        117    00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.030    truly bizarre an unsettling political        118    00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.490    season we bid farewell to the likes of        119    00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.590    Prince Harper Lee Antonin Scalia and        120    00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.900    David Bowie we witness student protests        121    00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.330    across the country and across Harvard we        122    00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.280    applauded the compassion of individuals        123    00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.470    like Isaiah Brit a seven-year-old from        124    00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.450    Virginia who raised $10,000 for        125    00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.610    elementary schools in Flint Michigan so        126    00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.080    their students would have clean water to        127    00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:25.860    drink and let's just say we had mixed        128    00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.870    feelings about the various rulings on        129    00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.170    Tom Brady's role in deflategate go        130    00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.710    Giants        131    00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:44.939    oh come on like I said mixed feelings        132    00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:48.789    you you may be worried you may be        133    00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:50.199    worried about the world that you are        134    00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:51.819    about to reenter and I'm here to tell        135    00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:55.029    you that's not a bad idea can I have        136    00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:56.319    some applause for that it's a scary        137    00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:01.899    world in all seriousness disparities and        138    00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:03.999    injustice is based on income wealth and        139    00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:05.800    race continued a week in the fabric of        140    00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.860    our world our nation in our communities        141    00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.869    intolerance and authoritarianism appear        142    00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:12.610    by some measures on the rise both at        143    00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.619    home and abroad our world seems to be        144    00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:16.360    getting hotter and less hospitable both        145    00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.489    politically and environmentally though        146    00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:20.259    it was truly heartening to learn that as        147    00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:22.629    of this year the lovable manatee is no        148    00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:28.419    longer an endangered species by coming        149    00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:30.489    to HGSE you have signaled that your        150    00:07:30.489 --> 00:07:32.289    response to social inequities and        151    00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:34.079    injustice is is through education I'm        152    00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:36.639    surely a biased but I applaud your        153    00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:38.649    choice as I'm convinced that education        154    00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:42.159    is the only long-term solution to these        155    00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:45.149    long-term problems        156    00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.190    for that reason I believe you are the        157    00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.110    luckiest graduates in the entire        158    00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.880    university because you are going to work        159    00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.560    in education and there is no higher        160    00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.190    calling        161    00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.889    no more rewarding or meaningful field in        162    00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:07.820    which to work I hope and trust I hope        163    00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.770    and trust you feel prepared and inspired        164    00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.660    for the tasks that lie ahead I have seen        165    00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.820    your passion your commitment to social        166    00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.800    justice and your enormous talents on        167    00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.990    display all year and while I'm sad to        168    00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.669    bid you farewell I take solace and        169    00:08:19.669 --> 00:08:21.020    knowing that you are leaving here to        170    00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.190    make the world a better place        171    00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:27.460    in short you are all going to rock I        172    00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.270    know I said this to last year's class        173    00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.469    but this year I really mean it whether        174    00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:40.870    you are graduating from our EDD program        175    00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:45.490    our EDL d program        176    00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:54.019    or our masters and Cas programs you're        177    00:08:54.019 --> 00:08:56.089    all collectively and individually going        178    00:08:56.089 --> 00:08:58.249    to rock I'm sure of it okay so any        179    00:08:58.249 --> 00:09:02.839    questions so far no okay so clearly we        180    00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:05.149    have some work to do on the importance        181    00:09:05.149 --> 00:09:07.699    of good questions as my pithy title        182    00:09:07.699 --> 00:09:09.470    suggests I have three suggestions for        183    00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.629    you in this regard the first suggestion        184    00:09:11.629 --> 00:09:13.639    is that you cultivate the art of asking        185    00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:16.610    good questions with your newly minted        186    00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.350    Harvard degree you might think that        187    00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.089    you're now expected to have all the        188    00:09:20.089 --> 00:09:22.449    answers and others might think the same        189    00:09:22.449 --> 00:09:24.589    including especially those family        190    00:09:24.589 --> 00:09:26.360    members who financially contributed to        191    00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.809    your education or more broadly it's        192    00:09:29.809 --> 00:09:31.100    obvious that we live in a world where        193    00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.019    people both want instant answers and are        194    00:09:33.019 --> 00:09:34.999    ready to offer answers and judgments at        195    00:09:34.999 --> 00:09:36.920    a moment's notice indeed this tendency        196    00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.839    defines far too much of our public        197    00:09:38.839 --> 00:09:41.089    discourse which is disturbingly shallow        198    00:09:41.089 --> 00:09:43.610    for just this reason I would urge you to        199    00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.410    resist the temptation to have answers at        200    00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.059    the ready and to spend more time        201    00:09:47.059 --> 00:09:49.249    thinking about the right questions to        202    00:09:49.249 --> 00:09:52.579    ask the simple truth is that an answer        203    00:09:52.579 --> 00:09:55.579    can only be as good as a question asked        204    00:09:55.579 --> 00:09:58.299    I know this from painful experience        205    00:09:58.299 --> 00:10:00.429    the scene was Charlottesville Virginia        206    00:10:00.429 --> 00:10:04.069    1990 at a UVA Law School dance I had        207    00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:05.569    finally mustered the courage to        208    00:10:05.569 --> 00:10:08.029    introduce myself to Cady Homer a fellow        209    00:10:08.029 --> 00:10:09.860    law student on whom I had developed a        210    00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.999    crush but I made two mistakes first I        211    00:10:13.999 --> 00:10:16.009    decided to introduce myself while kini        212    00:10:16.009 --> 00:10:19.360    was actually dancing with someone else        213    00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.649    please don't ask me why though that        214    00:10:21.649 --> 00:10:24.740    would be a good question the second and        215    00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.499    more important mistake is that I lost my        216    00:10:27.499 --> 00:10:29.240    nerve at the last minute and instead of        217    00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.189    introducing myself to Katy I actually        218    00:10:31.189 --> 00:10:34.329    introduced myself to her dance partner        219    00:10:34.329 --> 00:10:38.089    I'll call him Norman I asked quite        220    00:10:38.089 --> 00:10:39.919    loudly so I could be heard over the        221    00:10:39.919 --> 00:10:42.169    music are you Norman Huckabee by any        222    00:10:42.169 --> 00:10:44.629    chance I asked because we're in Civil        223    00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:46.399    Procedure class together and I've really        224    00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:47.959    admired your contributions to class        225    00:10:47.959 --> 00:10:51.259    discussion all I can say is please don't        226    00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:53.899    judge me at this point in any event        227    00:10:53.899 --> 00:10:56.329    Norman cheerfully answered I sure AM and        228    00:10:56.329 --> 00:10:59.510    thanks now given the question        229    00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.460    I asked that was a perfectly appropriate        230    00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.610    answer but it was still the wrong answer        231    00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.430    the right answer was I'm Katie Homer        232    00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:10.370    it's so nice to meet you and yes I        233    00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.390    actually would like to marry you        234    00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.040    but without asking the right question I        235    00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.100    couldn't hope to get the right answer        236    00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.630    luckily for me Katie understood the real        237    00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.400    question I was trying to ask which may        238    00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.290    explain why we are married today rather        239    00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:34.520    than Norman and I but thinking of Mary        240    00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.410    bonauto an honorary degree recipient        241    00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.210    this morning how great is it that if        242    00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.070    circumstances were different Norman and        243    00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:43.270    I could be married today        244    00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.790    so posing good questions is harder than        245    00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.470    it might seem and I say this not simply        246    00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.120    by way of explaining why I asked the        247    00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.070    wrong question at the dance it's hard        248    00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.260    because asking good questions requires        249    00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.190    that you see past easy answers and focus        250    00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.260    instead on the difficult the tricky the        251    00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.600    mysterious the awkward and sometimes the        252    00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.880    painful but I suspect that you and your        253    00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.530    listeners will be richer for the effort        254    00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:11.210    and that this will be true in both your        255    00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:13.790    professional and your personal lives for        256    00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.560    those who will be teachers for example        257    00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.990    you know that the question lies at the        258    00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:20.360    heart of education that well posed        259    00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.520    questions make knowledge come to life        260    00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.650    and create the spark that lights the        261    00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:26.900    flame of curiosity and there is no        262    00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.090    greater gift to bestow on students than        263    00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.030    the gift of curiosity for those who will        264    00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.920    be leaders which is to say all of you        265    00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.230    don't worry about having all the answers        266    00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.210    great leaders don't have all the answers        267    00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:40.310    that they know how to ask the right        268    00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:42.680    questions questions that force others        269    00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.990    and themselves to move past old and        270    00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:46.820    tired answers questions that open up        271    00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.010    possibilities that before the question        272    00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.860    was posed went unseen for those of you        273    00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.290    who will be researchers and innovators        274    00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.850    remember the observation of Jonas Salk        275    00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.860    who discovered and developed the vaccine        276    00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.750    for polio what people think of as a        277    00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.760    moment of discovery he observed is        278    00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.010    really the discovery of the question it        279    00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.530    takes time and work to discover the        280    00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.470    question for your sake and ours please        281    00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:11.960    take that time asking good questions        282    00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.430    will be just as rewarding        283    00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:14.930    your personal life good friends as you        284    00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:16.760    know ask great questions as do good        285    00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.040    parents they pose questions that just in        286    00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.230    the asking show my show how much they        287    00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:23.480    know and care about you they ask        288    00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.100    questions that make you pause that make        289    00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.620    you think that provoke honesty and that        290    00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.200    invite a deeper connection they ask        291    00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.600    questions that don't so much demand an        292    00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.510    answer as proved irresistible because        293    00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:38.240    they're so compelling my simple point is        294    00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.880    that posing irresistible questions is an        295    00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.940    art worth cultivating stressing the        296    00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:44.930    importance of asking good questions        297    00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:47.020    implies that there are bad questions        298    00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.459    which brings me to my second suggestion        299    00:13:49.459 --> 00:13:51.800    it's a cliche to say that there is no        300    00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.320    such thing as a bad question that's        301    00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.410    actually false but only partially so        302    00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:59.180    there are plenty of questions that are        303    00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.250    bad at first glance as in are you Norman        304    00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:04.670    Huckabee whether those questions remain        305    00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:06.560    bad however often depends on the        306    00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.600    listener and the suggestion I want to        307    00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.580    make to you is that you as listeners        308    00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.680    have within you the power to turn most        309    00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.959    bad questions into good ones provided        310    00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:17.230    that you listen carefully and generously        311    00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.880    to be sure you will come across some        312    00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.589    questions that are beyond repair but        313    00:14:21.589 --> 00:14:23.630    many that seem bad at first glance are        314    00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.910    actually good questions or at least        315    00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.650    innocent ones that are dressed in        316    00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.290    awkward clothing to help you see this        317    00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.810    I'd like to give you a short quiz or as        318    00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.980    they say today a formative assessment I        319    00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.690    will tell two stories both true and your        320    00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.520    task is to identify what's different        321    00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.880    about them shortly after I arrived on        322    00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.040    the Yale campus as a college freshman I        323    00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.750    struck up a conversation with a female        324    00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.580    classmate now I should say Yale is        325    00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.870    important to the second story I'm not        326    00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.360    just trying to slip that in quietly this        327    00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.310    is not like my gratuitously saying boola        328    00:14:55.310 --> 00:15:00.380    boola boola boola in any event I was        329    00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.390    having this lively and easy conversation        330    00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:03.529    it seemed to be going really well and        331    00:15:03.529 --> 00:15:05.870    then after about 20 minutes my classmate        332    00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.700    paused and said can I ask you a question        333    00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.520    and I thought to myself this is amazing        334    00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.190    I've only been on campus for two days        335    00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:14.810    and I'm pretty sure I'm about to be        336    00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:19.279    asked out on a date now before I tell        337    00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:21.890    you the question she actually asked I        338    00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:23.900    should point out that when I started        339    00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.450    college at this point in my life I was        340    00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:27.620    roughly five        341    00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.320    feet three inches tall a good six inches        342    00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.390    shorter than the hulking five foot nine        343    00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.920    inch frame that stands before you today        344    00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:48.250    perhaps more relevant to this story at        345    00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.800    this point in my life puberty was to me        346    00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.880    still a hypothetical concept in short so        347    00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.540    to speak        348    00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.120    I look like I was about 12 or 13 years        349    00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.310    old so back to the question instead of        350    00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:01.630    asking me to dinner        351    00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.510    my hope for date said I'm not quite sure        352    00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.060    how best to ask this but are you one of        353    00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:13.570    those you know child prodigies funny for        354    00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:19.270    you maybe now contrast that to a        355    00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.890    question my mother was asked about two        356    00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:22.510    months after my child prodigy        357    00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.340    conversation I grew up in a small        358    00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.350    blue-collar town in northern New Jersey        359    00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.300    called Midland Park it was filled with        360    00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.910    plumbers electricians and landscapers it        361    00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.410    was surrounded by wealthier suburbs        362    00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.170    whose homeowners employed the plumbers        363    00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:36.760    electricians and landscapers from        364    00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.130    Midland Park our grocery store the A&P        365    00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:40.930    was on the border of Midland Park and        366    00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:42.640    one of these wealthy neighboring towns        367    00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.800    as my mother was putting groceries in        368    00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.900    her car one day a particularly well        369    00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.150    coughed woman came over and asked my mom        370    00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:51.730    if she was from Midland Park after my        371    00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.560    mom told her yes the woman pointed to        372    00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.089    the Yale sticker on the back windshield        373    00:16:55.089 --> 00:16:56.860    of my parents car which they had just        374    00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.320    purchased they just purchased a sticker        375    00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.660    at parents weekend a few weeks earlier        376    00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.910    and this woman asked my mom I don't mean        377    00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.430    to pry but I'm just so curious was that        378    00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:08.020    Yale sticker on the car when you bought        379    00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:08.350    it        380    00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:14.199    I know right yeah so you see the        381    00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:15.640    difference between these two questions        382    00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.670    right the first one was innocent which I        383    00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.130    even recognized ultimately once I got        384    00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:22.750    over feeling embarrassed and finally hit        385    00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.699    puberty if just a few agonizingly long        386    00:17:24.699 --> 00:17:28.600    years later the second question was        387    00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.550    hostile it wasn't even a question really        388    00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.810    it was an insult        389    00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.820    you will get if you haven't already some        390    00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.890    hostile questions in your life some from        391    00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.600    strangers others from colleagues or        392    00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.430    supervisors or parents or school board        393    00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.920    members or even from students the trick        394    00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.660    is to distinguish the hostile ones from        395    00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.270    the genuine but clumsy ones because the        396    00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.800    clumsy question might really be the        397    00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.900    questioners way of asking to get to know        398    00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.430    you better or could just be motivated by        399    00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:54.830    mixture of anxiety and ignorance and to        400    00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.380    close the loop here the only truly bad        401    00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.150    questions are not really questions at        402    00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:01.100    all their statements meant to be        403    00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.600    demeaning or designed to trip you up        404    00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.540    that are disguised as questions beware        405    00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.260    of those denounced them or ignore them        406    00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.000    as the occasion demands but let your        407    00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.070    heart your ears and your mind remain        408    00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.860    open to all others my final suggestion        409    00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.420    is that there are five truly essential        410    00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.860    questions that you should regularly ask        411    00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.260    yourself and others my claim is that and        412    00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.700    this is slightly outlandish as a claim        413    00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.340    but this is a graduation speech if you        414    00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.540    get in the habit of asking these        415    00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.070    questions you have a very good chance of        416    00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.140    being both successful and happy and you        417    00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:31.700    will be in a great position to answer I        418    00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.150    did - the bonus question at the end the        419    00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.160    first is a question my kids are fond of        420    00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.510    asking and it's one you may have heard        421    00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.700    other teenagers pose or maybe you still        422    00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.230    pose it yourself the question is the        423    00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:48.860    classic weight but it could be asked as        424    00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.640    weight what or weight what my kids        425    00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.830    typically pose this question when I get        426    00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.270    to the point in a conversation where I'm        427    00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.490    asking them to do a chore - from their        428    00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:00.050    perspective they hear me saying blah        429    00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.180    blah blah blah blah blah and then        430    00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.620    tomorrow I'd like you to clean your room        431    00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.510    and at that precise moment the question        432    00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:09.620    comes wait what clean what wait what is        433    00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.630    actually a very effective way of asking        434    00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.820    for clarification which is crucial to        435    00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.440    understanding it's a question you should        436    00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.350    ask before drawing conclusions or before        437    00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:20.420    making a decision the Dean of Harvard        438    00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.760    College Rakesh Khurana gave a great        439    00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.590    master class this year where he        440    00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.630    emphasized the importance of inquiry /        441    00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.120    advocacy it's important to understand an        442    00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.460    idea in other words before you advocate        443    00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.250    for or against it the weight which        444    00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.560    precedes the what is also a good        445    00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.750    reminder that it pays to slow down to        446    00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.970    make sure you truly understand the        447    00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.070    second question is I wonder which can be        448    00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.710    followed by why or if so I wonder why I        449    00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:49.280    wonder if asking I wonder why is the way        450    00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.170    to remain curious about the world and        451    00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:53.300    asking I wonder if is the way to start        452    00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.310    thinking about how you might improve the        453    00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:57.350    world as and I wonder why our schools        454    00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.690    are so segregated and I wonder if we        455    00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:01.820    could change this or I wonder why        456    00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.920    students often seem bored in school and        457    00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.830    I wonder if we could make their classes        458    00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.710    more engaging the third question is        459    00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.980    couldn't we at least this is a question        460    00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.509    to ask that will enable you to get        461    00:20:13.509 --> 00:20:16.239    unstuck as they say it's what enables        462    00:20:16.239 --> 00:20:17.889    you to get past disagreement to some        463    00:20:17.889 --> 00:20:20.559    consensus as in couldn't we at least all        464    00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:22.480    agree that we care about the welfare of        465    00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.919    students even if we disagree about        466    00:20:23.919 --> 00:20:27.070    strategy it's also a way to get started        467    00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.350    when you're not sure where you'll finish        468    00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:32.529    as in couldn't we at least begin by        469    00:20:32.529 --> 00:20:34.090    making sure that all kids have the        470    00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:35.619    chance to come to school healthy and        471    00:20:35.619 --> 00:20:39.100    well fed the fourth question is how can        472    00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.940    I help you are at HGSE I presume because        473    00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.710    you are interested in helping others but        474    00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.899    you know from your time here to be aware        475    00:20:46.899 --> 00:20:49.330    of the savior complex of the stance        476    00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.429    where you are the expert or the hero who        477    00:20:51.429 --> 00:20:54.489    swoops in to save others we shouldn't        478    00:20:54.489 --> 00:20:56.590    let the real pitfalls of the Savior        479    00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.239    complex extinguish one of the most        480    00:20:58.239 --> 00:21:00.879    humane instincts there is the instinct        481    00:21:00.879 --> 00:21:04.659    to lend a hand but how we help matters        482    00:21:04.659 --> 00:21:07.029    as much is that we do help and if you        483    00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:10.600    ask how can I help you're asking with        484    00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.850    humility for direction and you are        485    00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.190    recognizing that others are experts in        486    00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.230    their own lives and that they will        487    00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.679    likely help you as much as you help them        488    00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:22.960    the fifth question is what truly matters        489    00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.629    you can tack on to me as appropriate        490    00:21:25.629 --> 00:21:27.940    this is a question that forces you to        491    00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.399    get to the heart of issues and to the        492    00:21:30.399 --> 00:21:31.600    heart of your own beliefs and        493    00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.879    convictions indeed it's a question you        494    00:21:33.879 --> 00:21:36.369    might add to or substitute for New        495    00:21:36.369 --> 00:21:38.049    Year's resolutions you might ask        496    00:21:38.049 --> 00:21:41.109    yourself in other words every new year        497    00:21:41.109 --> 00:21:44.109    what truly matters to many so these are        498    00:21:44.109 --> 00:21:45.820    the five essential questions wait what        499    00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.009    is at the root of all understanding I        500    00:21:48.009 --> 00:21:50.519    wonder is at the heart of all curiosity        501    00:21:50.519 --> 00:21:53.289    couldn't we at least is at the beginning        502    00:21:53.289 --> 00:21:55.659    of all progress how can I help is at the        503    00:21:55.659 --> 00:21:57.970    base of all good relationships and what        504    00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.950    really matters gets you to the heart of        505    00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:01.389    life if you ask these questions        506    00:22:01.389 --> 00:22:04.629    regularly especially last one you'll be        507    00:22:04.629 --> 00:22:06.249    in a great position to answer the bonus        508    00:22:06.249 --> 00:22:08.440    question which is at the end of the day        509    00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.840    the most important question you'll ever        510    00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.659    face this bonus question is posed in        511    00:22:13.659 --> 00:22:15.009    many ways and you've surely heard a        512    00:22:15.009 --> 00:22:17.230    version of it before to me the single        513    00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:19.290    best phrasing of this question comes in        514    00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:21.600    poem by Raymond Carver called late        515    00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.300    fragments it's one of the last poems he        516    00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.790    wrote I came across it recently on the        517    00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:29.430    very sad occasion of a memorial service        518    00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.650    for one of my dearest and closest        519    00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.390    friends my former law school roommate        520    00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.670    Doug Kendall who died in September at        521    00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.640    the far too young age of 51 the poem was        522    00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.260    printed on the back of the program for        523    00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.090    his memorial and it starts with this        524    00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:43.860    question what I'm calling the bonus        525    00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.140    question and did you get what you wanted        526    00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:50.400    out of life even so did you get what you        527    00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.450    wanted out of life        528    00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:54.600    even so the even so part of this to me        529    00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.450    captures perfectly the recognition of        530    00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.250    the pain and disappointment that        531    00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:02.310    inevitably make up a full life but also        532    00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:05.730    the hope that life even so offers the        533    00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.910    possibility of joy and contentment my        534    00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:10.710    claim is that if you regularly ask wait        535    00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:12.240    what I wonder        536    00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.980    couldn't we at least how can I help and        537    00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.900    what really matters when it comes time        538    00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.640    to ask yourself and did you get what you        539    00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.730    wanted out of life even so your answer        540    00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:24.060    will be I did so the poem asks and did        541    00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.620    you get what you wanted out of life even        542    00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.470    so and then continues I did and what did        543    00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:33.150    you want to call myself beloved to feel        544    00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:37.740    beloved on this earth to feel beloved is        545    00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.890    to feel not only dearly loved but also        546    00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:43.380    cherished and respected and while I        547    00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:47.370    promise I'm at the very near end of my        548    00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:49.170    speech let me just say that when I read        549    00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:50.820    these lines it's hard for me not to        550    00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.790    think about students we spend a lot of        551    00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:56.640    time here and elsewhere thinking about        552    00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.110    how we might improve student performance        553    00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:01.440    which is just as it should be yet I        554    00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.620    can't help but think that schools and        555    00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.330    indeed the world would be better places        556    00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.690    if students didn't simply perform well        557    00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:12.450    but also felt beloved beloved by their        558    00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:15.500    teachers and by their fellow classmates        559    00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.760    to tie this all together into one        560    00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.520    slightly misshapen package and to bid        561    00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.070    you a final farewell as you leave Appian        562    00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.660    Way and head into a world that        563    00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.660    desperately needs you let me express my        564    00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.300    sincere hope and belief that if you        565    00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.280    never stop asking and listening for good        566    00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:32.960    question        567    00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.820    you will feel beloved on this earth and        568    00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.280    just as importantly you will help others        569    00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.830    especially students feel the same thank        570    00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.280    you very much        "

   seems unavoidable and mesmerizing what        21    00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.730    is going on what is happening to the        22    00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.510    world the tumultuous state of

 00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.170    before it is in some ways reassuring at        41    00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.060    this 365th commencement to recall all        42    00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.840    that Harvard has endured over centuries        43    00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.310    a number of these festival rites took        44    00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.269    place under clouds of war others in        45    00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.180    times of financial crisis and despair        46    00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.440    still others in face of epidemics from        47    00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.310    smallpox in the 17th century to the        48    00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.130    devastating flu of 1918 to the h1n1        49    00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.299    virus just a few years ago Harvard has        50    00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.290    not just survived these challenges but        51    00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.190    has helped to confront them we sing in        52    00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.980    all our alma mater about calm rising        53    00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.889    through change and through storm what        54    00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.819    does that mean for today's crises where        55    00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.389    do universities fit in this threatening        56    00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:41.959    mix what can we do what should we do        57    00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.549    what must we do we are gathered today in        58    00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.760    tercentenary theatre with Widener

time when we have never        64    00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.620    needed them more and much is at stake        65    00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.159    for us and for the world we look at        66    00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:18.760    Widener Library and        67    00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.720    see a great edifice a backdrop of giant        68    00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.560    columns where photos are taken and 27        69    00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.580    steps are worn down ever so slightly by        70    00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.400    the feet of a century of students and        71    00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.750    scholars we also see a repository of        72    00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.820    learning with 57 miles of shelving at        73    00:04:41.820 -->

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.350    facts that fuel free inquiry and our        79    00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.240    constantly evolving understanding a        80    00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.450    vehicle for Veritas for exploring the        81    00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.250    path to truth wherever it may lead a        82    00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.680    tribute to the belief that knowledge        83    00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.140    matters that facts matter in the present        84    00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.110    moment as a basis for the informed        85

   for new insight as James Madison wrote        88    00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.210    in 1822 a people who mean to be their        89    00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.260    own governor's must arm themselves with        90    00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.280    the power that knowledge gives or as        91    00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.620    early 20th century civil rights        92

   evidence reason facts logic an        95    00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.290    understanding of history and of science        96    00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.420    the ability to know as former dean

00:06:26.500    bedrock of Education and of an informed        100    00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.150    citizenry with the capacity        101    00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.040    to lead to explore to invent yet this        102    00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.850    commitment to reason and truth to their        103    00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.790    pursuit and preeminence seems        104    00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.110    increasingly a minority viewpoint in a        105    00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.170    recent column George will deplored the        106    00:06:48.170 -->

and adapt to facts universities        109    00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.670    are defined by this principle we produce        110    00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.620    a ready stream of evidence and insights        111    00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.020    many with potential to create a better        112    00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.330    world so what are our obligations when        113    00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.180    we see our fundamental purpose under        114    00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.230    siege our reason for being discounted        115    00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:29.810    and undermined first we must maintain an        116    00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.380    unwavering dedication to rigorous        117    00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.500    assessment and debate within our own        118    00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.150    walls we must be unassailable in our        119    00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.690    insistence that ideas most fully thrive        120    00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.610    and grow when they are open to challenge        121    00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:53.330    truth cannot simply be claimed it must        122    00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.470    be established even when that process is        123    00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.970    uncomfortable universities do not just        124    00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.000    store facts they teach us how to        125    00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.780    evaluate tests challenge and refine them        126    00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.390    only if we ourselves model a commitment        127    00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.850    to fact over what Stephen Colbert so        128    00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.240    memorably labeled as truthiness and he        129    00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.550    also actually sometimes called it very        130    00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.300    toss eNOS        131    00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.560    only then can we credibly call for        132    00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.360    adherence to such standards in public        133    00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.770    life and in a wider world we must model        134    00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.919    this commitment for our students as we        135    00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.620    educate them to embrace these principles        136    00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.190    in their work here and in the lives they        137    00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.589    will lead as citizens and leaders of        138    00:08:48.589 --> 00:08:52.880    national and international life we must        139    00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.180    support and sustain fact and reason        140    00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:00.890    beyond our walls as yell as well and we        141    00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:05.779    must do still more facing Widener stands        142    00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:09.440    Memorial Church built in the aftermath        143    00:09:09.440 -->

quality of men's and women's        146    00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.320    thoughts but as my predecessor James        147    00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.130    Conant put it the radiance of their        148    00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:32.779    deeds the more than 1100 Harvard and        149    00:09:32.779 --> 00:09:35.630    Radcliffe students faculty and alumni        150    00:09:35.630 -->

they believed that some        153    00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.959    things had greater value than their own        154    00:09:49.959 --> 00:09:54.620    individual lives are juxtaposed Widener

00:10:04.070    represent because I believe that reason        158    00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.220    and knowledge must be inflected with        159    00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.490    values and that those of us who are        160    00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.890    privileged to be part of this community        161    00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:14.890    of learning their consequent        162    00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.200    responsibilities now it may surprise        163    00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.890    some of you to hear that this is not an        164    00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:24.170    uncontroversial assertion for this        165    00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.320    morning ceremony I wore the traditional        166    00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.410    Harvard

00:10:45.910    of Harvard College created to educate a        172    00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.870    learnin ministry up until the end of the        173    00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:54.010    1800s most American college presidents        174    00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:57.160    taught a course on moral philosophy to        175    00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.640    graduating students but with the rise of        176    00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.460    the research university in the late 19th        177    00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:08.140    and early 20th century moral and ethical        178    00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:12.010    purposes came to be seen as at odds with        179    00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:15.130    the scientific thinking transforming        180    00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:19.540    higher education but in today's world I        181    00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.870    believe it is dangerous for universities        182    00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.990    not to fully acknowledge and embrace        183    00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.470    their responsibilities to values and to        184    00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.320    service as well as to reason and        185    00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.700    discovery there is no value free science        186    00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:42.150    there is no algorithm that writes itself        187    00:11:51.149 --> 00:11:55.540    the questions we choose to ask and the        188    00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.959    research we decide to support the        189    00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:02.229    standards of integrity we expect of our        190    00:12:02.229 --> 00:12:05.859    colleagues and students the community we        191    00:12:05.859 --> 00:12:10.209    build and the model we offer all of this        192    00:12:10.209 --> 00:12:14.470    is central to who we are we can see        193    00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.869    these values clearly in the choices and        194    00:12:16.869 --> 00:12:19.649    passions of our faculty and students in        195    00:12:19.649 --> 00:12:22.149    the motto of Harvard Business School        196    00:12:22.149 --> 00:12:25.509    which you heard this morning uh turd by        197    00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:28.269    the Dean the commitment to make a        198    00:12:28.269 --> 00:12:31.449    difference in the world most of the rest        199    00:12:31.449 --> 00:12:33.850    of the university would readily embrace        200    00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:37.509    this sentiment in the enthusiasm of        201    00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:39.489    students and faculty we see it as well        202    00:12:39.489 --> 00:12:42.549    from across the university graduate        203    00:12:42.549 --> 00:12:44.139    professional and hundreds of        204    00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:47.079    undergraduates we see a remarkable        205    00:12:47.079 --> 00:12:49.359    enthusiasm for example for the field of        206    00:12:49.359 --> 00:12:52.479    global health because it unites the        207    00:12:52.479 --> 00:12:55.269    power of knowledge and science with a        208    00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:58.119    deeply felt desire to do good in the        209    00:12:58.119 --> 00:13:01.239    world to lead lives of meaning and        210    00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:05.049    purpose this spirit animates not just        211    00:13:05.049 --> 00:13:08.730    global health but so much of all we do        212    00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:13.049    Harvard is and must be a community of        213    00:13:13.049 --> 00:13:17.889    idealists and today we send thousands of        214    00:13:17.889 --> 00:13:21.579    you doctors lawyers teachers artists        215    00:13:21.579 -->

youngest students those        218    00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.429    just beginning to shape their adult        219    00:13:33.429 --> 00:13:33.999    lives        220    00:13:33.999 -->

for them these questions of        223    00:13:44.289 --> 00:13:47.489    values and responsibilities take on        224    00:13:47.489 --> 00:13:52.329    particular salience Harvard College is a

difference we at Harvard        235    00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:29.740    strive to be united by it in myriad ways        236    00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.530    we challenge our students to be        237    00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:36.490    individuals of character as well as of        238    00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:40.060    learning we seek to establish standards        239    00:14:40.060 -->

00:00:52.380    brother hard in the forearm with a red        7    00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.620    plastic wiffle ball bat and I was really        8    00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.320    really sorry he is 13 years my senior 18        9    00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.540    at the time so we didn't roughhouse that        10    00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.210    much but it still surprised me that he        11    00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.810    took the hit so hard as the pain grew        12    00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.119    first a couple days and then a week or        13    00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.580    so his insistence that something was        14    00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.460    wrong one out against Mama's intuition        15    00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.880    that it was just a bad bruise none of us        16    00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.220    knew that trauma could aggravate a rare        17    00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.880    form of cancer called osteosarcoma        18    00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.460    trauma like a fall or a swing from a        19    00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.940    four-year-olds toy what we all thought        20    00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.160    was just child's play had awakened the        21    00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.960    tumor in my brother's arm that was        22    00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.380    already there the memories are faint now        23    00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.380    but I must have thought wow I've really        24    00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.420    gone and done it I'm so sorry it's        25    00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.460    coming up on two decades later and        26    00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.950    besides my brief step at t-ball I've        27    00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.220    given up bats for good        28    00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.170    also after treatment and recovery my        29    00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.360    brother has been cancer-free for over a        30    00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.570    decade        31    00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.410    I learned many years ago that the cancer        32    00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.150    wasn't my fault        33    00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.819    I'll never forget the day that mama told        34    00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.880    me Joshua what you did was a blessing in        35    00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.450    disguise which I with my fledgling        36    00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.060    vocabulary misunderstood as a blessing        37    00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.130    in the skies that somehow I had been        38    00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.170    God's little helper and making sure my        39    00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.580    big brother was okay in a way both turns        40    00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.580    of phrase mean the same thing I believed        41    00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.470    I had been at just the right place at        42    00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.720    the right time and that everything had        43    00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.180    played out as a set of the best possible        44    00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.850    circumstances I didn't need to feel        45    00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.380    sorry anymore but in the time that has        46    00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.959    passed I have learned new ways to be        47    00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.050    sorry new ways to worry that I might be        48    00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.410    making mistakes i disguised the truest        49    00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.080    version of myself behind apology after        50    00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.680    apology I'm sorry for being annoying I'm        51    00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.510    sorry for taking up too much space        52    00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.769    I'm sorry if this speech is boring you        53    00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.380    we all do it here at Harvard where        54    00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.110    everyone seems to be a straight-a type a        55    00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.390    student I believe our biggest struggle        56    00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.670    often becomes finding ways to feel        57    00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.480    inadequate        58    00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.120    so unused to being among people who are        59    00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.190    and all their differences still so        60    00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.980    similar to ourselves we constantly play        61    00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.870    the game of throwing ourselves into        62    00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.019    relief of one another we assume a need        63    00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.810    to be apologetic up front to save        64    00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.870    ourselves from vulnerability incessantly        65    00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.329    teasing out our strengths and weaknesses        66    00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.970    we forget that we are whole people with        67    00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.130    complexities that interact mellifluous        68    00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.690    ly like lines of musical counterpoint I        69    00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.760    sing quite a bit and in the same way        70    00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.739    that I beat myself up over singing a        71    00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.049    wrong note that destabilizes a harmony        72    00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.690    we obsess over whether or not every        73    00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.980    fiber of our being is ringing in tune I        74    00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.859    have a fear I fear that I don't know how        75    00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.019    to live life authentically because I've        76    00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.450    spent so much time trying to be a        77    00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.090    perfect        78    00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.150    version of myself I won't say that it        79    00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.520    was time wasted that drive for        80    00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.110    perfection helped me to grow as a        81    00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.780    musician and it also helped me to turn        82    00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.410    in something that looks like a thesis        83    00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.740    but I will say looking out inspired by        84    00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.930    your presence here today that it's high        85    00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.889    time I learned to live without apology        86    00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.389    being authentic requires it it means not        87    00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.560    apologizing for the imperfections        88    00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.440    because those imperfections make up our        89    00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.979    beautiful differences in the classroom        90    00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.639    as a student of music and French I spent        91    00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:56.750    a lot of time thinking about        92    00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.389    authenticity and difference and about        93    00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.419    how those things make us human I also        94    00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.490    think a lot about how to navigate my own        95    00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.639    subjectivity as an artist I struggle        96    00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.680    with the conundrum of how to be true to        97    00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.440    myself when a big part of my life is        98    00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.680    framed by performance I struggle more        99    00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.919    with the ways I must perform as a person        100    00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.700    of color and a too often hostile world        101    00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.979    but I have discovered that the        102    00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.139    relationship between performing and        103    00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.690    living authentically can be a space of        104    00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.370    self exploration in fact the two are not        105    00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.400    so different from me I have begun to        106    00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.280    feel the most like myself when I'm on        107    00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.849    stage when the lights go up I feel the        108    00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:48.500    need to apologize fly away why is it so        109    00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.840    hard to find this strength in everyday        110    00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.320    life what is this force that keeps human        111    00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.139    beings creative and adaptive beings        112    00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.580    moving and living professor Alice        113    00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.000    Jardine my adviser and my academic mom        114    00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.240    once gave an answer to that question her        115    00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.669    hair curling in the heat of the Parisian        116    00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:15.770    summer she said it's play you lose that        117    00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.620    play and you're fried you're done I        118    00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.660    think that's a good warning for all of        119    00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.020    us        120    00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.450    artists or not when I am on stage I am        121    00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.540    play but I want to be at play all the        122    00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.880    time not just because play has served        123    00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.490    humankind well but because it feels        124    00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.690    right it feels like me the me I don't        125    00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.310    have to be sorry for        126    00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.610    we have to take ourselves less seriously        127    00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.040    and our beneficial relationship to the        128    00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.070    world around us more seriously we have        129    00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.500    something to give this world something        130    00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.630    that being a cookie cutter a human being        131    00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.900    can't give it in turn the world has many        132    00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.360    things to offer us gifts and        133    00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.520    opportunities that we cannot accept if        134    00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.130    we're preoccupied with perfection and        135    00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.090    not with play when we play we learn how        136    00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.030    being vulnerable can lead to meaningful        137    00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.220    collaboration when we play we reach        138    00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.520    upward and outward hands open to receive        139    00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.340    both life's pleasures and it's necessary        140    00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.360    pains I haven't done the statistical        141    00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.010    analysis on how many speeches have        142    00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.750    borrowed these words but frankly I don't        143    00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.810    care today you are you it's truer than        144    00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.290    true there's no one alive who is you er        145    00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.590    than you I don't have to be sorry for my        146    00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.710    poorness my privileges or my prowess I        147    00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.200    must only know that they are a part of        148    00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.930    me and that the mystic order of the        149    00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.430    skies has allowed it to be just so I        150    00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.140    want to invite all of us to find the        151    00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.410    courage to walk in that truth I've begun        152    00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.760    to find it and friends who are        153    00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.740    constantly pushing me out from shadows        154    00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.650    of self-doubt I have found it even in        155    00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.960    correcting myself out loud sometimes        156    00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.600    when I begin to say I'm sorry I stopped        157    00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.030    myself and announced to those around me        158    00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.170    no wait I'm not sorry of course I will        159    00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.540    be remorseful if I do something wrong or        160    00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.690    if I am somehow hurtful to others but        161    00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.990    from now on I will stop apologizing for        162    00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:23.330    me        163    00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.479    and I won't stop playing whether that        164    00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:29.750    play is musical expression or tinkering        165    00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:31.520    with things I don't understand or        166    00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.500    finding more of the places I have room        167    00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.890    to grow I will play with the ferocity        168    00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:40.430    and abandon of my four-year-old self and        169    00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.010    I will laugh at myself as the world        170    00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.910    watches or doesn't watch because play is        171    00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.480    essential because life could turn out        172    00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.690    far worse if you hold on to the red bat        173    00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:57.579    and never take this way        174    00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.510    you

acquaintance or as girl        33    00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.920    in Section I'm sorry to those who didn't        34    00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.690    you've nearly made it escape unscathed        35    00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.960    while you still can        36    00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.979    Harvard is a funny place        37    00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.590    not literally at least if you're judging        38    00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.060    by the quality of the Lampoon but it's        39    00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.460    but in a figurative sense on the one        40    00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.899    hand we leave it with a plethora of        41    00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.020    shared experiences memories and deeply        42    00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.759    rooted neuroses that will last a        43    00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:07.500    lifetime        44    00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.729    calling this place home for four years        45    00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.890    leaves unmistakable marks like an        46    00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.900    aversion to walking anywhere with quad        47    00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.060    in its name even though you'd walk much        48    00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.070    further to get somewhere else here's        49    00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.640    looking at you northwest labs but on the        50    00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.980    other hand the Harvard experience is        51    00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.370    something of a misnomer sure we all went        52    00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.060    here cried here laughed here manically        53    00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.160    cry laugh does the last remaining scraps        54    00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.260    of our sanity rolled away from us in the        55    00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.120    wee hours of the morning before a final        56    00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.989    paper or piece that was due all here but        57    00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.940    trying to figure out what to say to more        58    00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.519    than 1,600 individuals many of whom I've        59    00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.799    never been able to meet was like trying        60    00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.420    to find a reasonable Crimson staff        61    00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.660    editorial probably not impossible but        62    00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.780    not really worth the effort        63    00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.580    there are some keywords that unite us        64    00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.730    all        65    00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:10.550    mumps swai incommunicado and key        66    00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.650    questions like how am I supposed to        67    00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.940    reenact scenes from Good Will Hunting        68    00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.800    now that both the Bow Street Dunkin        69    00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.950    Donuts and Obon pen are gone and now        70    00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.440    that we're about to graduate how exactly        71    00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.100    does one adult but even these common        72    00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.750    threads of experience present their own        73    00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.390    problems most of us manage to steer        74    00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.800    clear of the mumps one of the many        75    00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.390    fringe benefits of not being in the        76    00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.770    Phoenix some of us perhaps however a        77    00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.050    deep but secret love of swai that we'll        78    00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.110    take to the grave some of us poor souls        79    00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.780    have never even seen Good Will Hunting        80    00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.340    at least no one knows how to be a real        81    00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.090    adult yet if they claim to they're lying        82    00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.940    um but seriously if someone can explain        83    00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.250    to me how exactly I get 401 K dollars        84    00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.320    into my 401 K please hit me up lucky for        85    00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.390    us there's no correct way to adults just        86    00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.160    as there was no correct way to Harvard        87    00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.910    what does it even mean to Harvard is it        88    00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.890    having more snow days during your time        89    00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.630    here than there were during the entire        90    00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.750    20th century is it walking into the        91    00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.340    Queen's Head pub with your best friend        92    00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.200    Ben Affleck I'm hearing you declare so        93    00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.739    this is a Javed BA is it getting pinkeye        94    00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.960    from Mather leather or could it be        95    00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.410    something else entirely take me for        96    00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.860    example        97    00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.320    not that this speech is or should be all        98    00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.210    about me but this is a story with which        99    00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.100    I happened to be familiar since I was        100    00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.040    there for some of it you think I'm        101    00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.450    talking about blacking out        102    00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.090    but don't be ridiculous I didn't party        103    00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.790    my trips to the hospital were for kidney        104    00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:44.300    stones        105    00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.990    I say trips plural because there were        106    00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.120    two and the second time I had to        107    00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.280    convince UHS that I was not in fact        108    00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.410    pregnant        109    00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.940    that I am standing here before you is        110    00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.970    nothing short of a miracle if there were        111    00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.220    an award for messing up as much as it is        112    00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.650    possible to do at Harvard I would have        113    00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.539    probably messed up getting that too I        114    00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.090    skipped classes didn't study for classes        115    00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.449    and then to my great astonishment failed        116    00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.090    classes and I don't mean I got to see I        117    00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.220    mean I failed classes we are talking        118    00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.810    academic probation for multiple        119    00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.599    semesters level stuff truly impressively        120    00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:25.470    awful        121    00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.900    I switched my concentration so much that        122    00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.669    the registrar's coping mechanism became        123    00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.819    too flat out ignore me and I could never        124    00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:34.500    seem to remember that notes has a seven        125    00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.659    dollar credit card minimum but I was        126    00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:39.120    always given pizza anyway so maybe we        127    00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.330    can call that a win the point is I made        128    00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.550    mistakes a lot of mistakes        129    00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.620    if the Harvard experience were a midterm        130    00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.849    I would probably have gotten like a 25%        131    00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:53.759    so I passed with flying colors and Here        132    00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:56.729    I am today but the larger point here is        133    00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.909    that we've made it science or humanities        134    00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:02.280    River our quad board plus spender or        135    00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.349    board plus hoarder yeah that's right we        136    00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:07.849    see you people who have $100 left in May        137    00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:11.039    we're all here now and we're all about        138    00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.690    to embark on yet another adventure        139    00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.690    together I'm getting all choked up just        140    00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.479    thinking about it my jaws swelling with        141    00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.110    emotion or maybe that's just the bumps        142    00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.940    and even though there won't be a        143    00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.590    screening of love story to ease our        144    00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.810    transition into the real world if I        145    00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.699    managed to dig my way out of the        146    00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.830    catastrophe that was much of my time in        147    00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.600    college none of you have anything to        148    00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.410    worry about        149    00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.210    except maybe scheduling dentist        150    00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.520    appointments because how do those even        151    00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.009    work do you call them on their cell        152    00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:43.800    phones late night when you have tooth        153    00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.150    pain can you order them on Amazon Prime        154    00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.500    do you tell them we should grab a meal        155    00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.130    sometime so you never have to go I guess        156    00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.600    these are just things we'll have to find        157    00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.419    out in the real world thank you all for        158    00:06:57.419 --> 00:06:59.400    the last four years and good luck not        159    00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.479    that you'll need it        160    00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:03.030    with adulting and thank you in advance        161    00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.010    for the couches I hope you will offer me        162    00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.110    when I'm inevitably fired for pushing        163    00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.270    back on comments and meetings and for        164    00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.130    being willfully underprepared for major        165    00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.199    events add poignant but hilarious        166    00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:16.370    conclusion here

   00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.559    good afternoon and        2    00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.360    welcome one of the wonderful courses in        3    00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.119    our MBA program and one that I used to        4    00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.600    enjoy teaching is called authentic        5    00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.600    leadership development a central idea in        6    00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.599    that course is that each one of us is        7    00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.519    deeply shaped by The Crucible        8    00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.880    experiences in our lives those moments        9    00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.040    of adversity that Mark us        10    00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.640    forever I think the same thing is true        11    00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.879    for us as a group and for the class of        12    00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.640    2016 a powerful Crucible experience was        13    00:00:44.640 -->

       31    00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.200    enjoyed or        32    00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.640    didn't friends with whom you laughed or        33    00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.240    cried today as you leave our campus I        34    00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.399    would like to offer you a l set of        35    00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.479    thoughts as you all know I am perhaps        36    00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.600    over fond of        37    00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.799    alliteration I'm going to talk to you        38    00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.080    today about Three Ages hope humility and        39    00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.360    honor when I think about hope my        40    00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.519    thoughts turn thousands of miles to the        41    00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.560    South to        42    00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.800    Antarctica over this last winter holiday        43    00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.120    I was fortunate to travel to this remote        44    00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.080    and magnificent part of the        45    00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.720    world what made the trip truly special        46    00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.720    for me was was that we were able to        47    00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.840    share this experience with my        48    00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.400    83-year-old father and his two        49    00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.400    grandchildren our College age        50    00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.840    daughters I know it may be way too early        51    00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.720    for you to be forming a bucket list but        52    00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.400    put this on yours when you get to        53    00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.400    it during much of this trip we were        54    00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.120    retracing the route traveled by the by        55    00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.400    the Explorer Ernest        56    00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.800    Shackleton many of you might be familiar        57    00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.200    with the story of Shackleton during a        58    00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.360    journey to EXP explor Antartica        59    00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.519    shackleton's ship the endurance became        60    00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.200    trapped in ice and was destroyed after        61    00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.760    many months the crew reached a deserted        62    00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.560    island but Shackleton determined they        63    00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.319    would die if they stayed there so 100        64    00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.440    years ago on this month of May        65    00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.920    Shackleton set out in a small open boat        66    00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.239    on an 800m Voyage to summon help leading        67    00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.159    Rescuers back to his crew all of whom        68    00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.959    miraculously and remarkably        69    00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.439    survived as I reread his story on our        70    00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.200    trip to Antarctica my admiration for        71    00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.599    Shackleton kept        72    00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.400    increasing even in a large modern ship        73    00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.640    the Seas were rough how he survived this        74    00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.519    Voyage in a tiny open boat is beyond my        75    00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.879    imagination yet shackleton's greatest        76    00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.599    achievement wasn't in the logistics or        77    00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.120    The Bravery of his mission        78    00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.280    instead it was this in a situation that        79    00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.120    most would have considered        80    00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.319    hopeless he continued not only to remain        81    00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.239    optimistic himself but he continually        82    00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.760    instilled hope in his crewm mates he        83    00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.120    refused to let them given to the despair        84    00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.799    that logic would lead them to feel he        85    00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.120    did not allow them to give up either        86    00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.320    emotionally or        87    00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.320    physically this is what great leaders do        88    00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.520    they not only spark home hope in        89    00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.800    themselves they instill hope in others        90    00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.639    as someone who has taught leadership for        91    00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.759    many years I am specially inspired by        92    00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.360    historical leaders like Abraham Lincoln        93    00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.240    or Winston Churchill or Mahatma Gandhi        94    00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.560    who nurtured a hope among vast numbers        95    00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.400    of people during the bleakest of times        96    00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.680    as you continue your work as Leaders        97    00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.560    always remember the importance of Hope        98    00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.560    the second quality of virtue I ask you        99    00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.039    to consider today is        100    00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.240    humility a few weeks ago when I visited        101    00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.919    your classrooms during Bridges I        102    00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.240    witnessed many of you discussing leaders        103    00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.680    who were inspiring examples of the        104    00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.199    school's mission of making a difference        105    00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.319    in the world across classes the word I        106    00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:24.039    most commonly found on the Blackboard        107    00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.400    outlining these leaders virtues was        108    00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.759    humility now humility is a broad quality        109    00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.600    but it has a few important        110    00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.639    Dimensions intellectual humility is the        111    00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.520    virtue of knowing that no matter how        112    00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.400    smart you think you are you can always        113    00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.400    learn something from other people now        114    00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.360    horror business school is a ideal        115    00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.639    training ground for INT intellectual        116    00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.680    humility while all of you are        117    00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.160    extraordinarily smart you have now spent        118    00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.000    2 years in classes where you have        119    00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.759    inevitably learned from someone else in        120    00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:00.880    the room and this is an attitude you        121    00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.080    should continue to exhibit throughout        122    00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.720    your        123    00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.319    careers equally important is moral        124    00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:10.319    humility which is the awareness that no        125    00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.520    matter how self assured you are about        126    00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.360    your moral compass you are vulnerable        127    00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.240    under stress or in certain contexts to        128    00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.560    losing your way remember the mgrm        129    00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.960    experiments you studied in your        130    00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.039    leadership and corporate accountability        131    00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.759    class although we would like to believe        132    00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.639    that we are the one who would be able to        133    00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.400    resist an authority figur instructions        134    00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.199    to deliver electric shocks to innocent        135    00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.360    people remind yourself that most people        136    00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.639    just like us with an equal commitment to        137    00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.199    decency succumbed in this situation it's        138    00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:48.680    a lesson you should keep in mind in your        139    00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.000    professional and personal        140    00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.039    lives personal humility is knowing that        141    00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:58.199    it is so much better to let others talk        142    00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:00.440    about your accomplishments than to talk        143    00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.319    about them yourself there are many        144    00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:04.919    Harvard Business School alumni who        145    00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:08.000    embody personal humility indeed as I        146    00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.599    think about the distinguished alumni we        147    00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:12.319    celebrate today it is a characteristic        148    00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:14.120    they all        149    00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.000    share someone I personally think of as        150    00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.520    exemplifying this virtue is Dick        151    00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.720    Spangler a member of our class of        152    00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.400    1956 who will be returning to campus        153    00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.319    next week for his 60th reunion now this        154    00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:31.599    is is something I hope each and every        155    00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:33.240    one of you will also        156    00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.879    do perhaps the most frequently told        157    00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:37.599    story about Mr        158    00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:40.520    Spangler is that is one that some of you        159    00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.240    may have experienced yourself when Mr        160    00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.720    Spangler visits campus he arrives        161    00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.919    unannounced his very favorite thing to        162    00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:52.199    do is to wander into the dining hall        163    00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:54.919    unobtrusively sit down with students as        164    00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:57.720    they eat their meals and engage them in        165    00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.159    discussions about their back grounds        166    00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:02.440    their studies and their        167    00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.720    Ambitions sometimes students leave these        168    00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.840    interactions having no idea who this        169    00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.919    charming inquisitive Southern gentleman        170    00:08:10.919 --> 00:08:14.240    was other times students might ask his        171    00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.199    name and he replies quite simply I'm        172    00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:19.319    dick        173    00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:22.280    Spangler when this happens you can see        174    00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.479    the puzzled look turning into an        175    00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:28.000    epiphany on these students faces oh my        176    00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.159    God I'm talking to Mr Spangler as in the        177    00:08:31.159 --> 00:08:32.159    Spangler        178    00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.120    Center there is a magic to how low-key        179    00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.839    Mr Spangler is about his contributions        180    00:08:37.839 --> 00:08:41.080    both to the world and to our institution        181    00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.240    he never calls attention to himself he        182    00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.200    doesn't travel with an        183    00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.519    Entourage he's more interested in        184    00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:50.600    learning about you than having you pay        185    00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.240    attention to him he listens far more        186    00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.720    than he        187    00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.440    talks this kind of personal humility is        188    00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.959    becoming all too rare as social breeder        189    00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:07.560    beats breeds an attitude of Look at me        190    00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.519    now I have nothing against posting        191    00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:12.079    photos of a joyous occasion like today        192    00:09:12.079 --> 00:09:13.920    but it's important to keep in mind that        193    00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.720    even when you're taking        194    00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.279    selfies other people are        195    00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:21.040    watching you will all become leaders of        196    00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.760    teams and organizations and as you        197    00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.560    assume these roles people will be        198    00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.800    watching closely for signs of huous and        199    00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.680    self-importance        200    00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.880    don't drop the        201    00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.720    hbomb this is never an attractive        202    00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.079    quality consider how frequently the        203    00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.200    tabloids are filled with stories about        204    00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.920    some self-entitled person shouting at        205    00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.120    someone those six words that can quickly        206    00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.680    ruin a        207    00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.920    reputation don't you know who I        208    00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.079    am so no matter what you accomplish and        209    00:09:56.079 --> 00:09:58.240    we all hope it will be a great great        210    00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.839    deal always remain        211    00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:05.040    humble finally I ask you to consider a        212    00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.360    third virtue that of        213    00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.120    Honor many people like to use the word        214    00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.640    honor as a noun as something you give or        215    00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.720    receive such as the honor you have        216    00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.120    achieved for yourself and your families        217    00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.760    by graduating from our institution this        218    00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.440    afternoon however I prefer to use the        219    00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.440    word honor most frequently as a verb in        220    00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.360    this usage honor is something active        221    00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.200    that you do honor is about making and        222    00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.079    keeping        223    00:10:35.079 --> 00:10:37.720    commitments start first by honoring        224    00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.000    people who don't expect it but whose        225    00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.200    work helps make your leadership possible        226    00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.920    two years ago students at horror        227    00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.200    business school began a practice called        228    00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.600    staff appreciation day and it's become        229    00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.880    one of my favorite annual        230    00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.040    traditions this is a day in which        231    00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.440    students honor the people who serve them        232    00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.720    around the campus the people who prepare        233    00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.440    their meals wash their blackboards and        234    00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.360    set up the chairs on which you're        235    00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.880    sitting right now this year your class        236    00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.880    utilized Instagram to offer these thanks        237    00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.920    and it was gratifying to see you put        238    00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.800    your own mark on this tradition even        239    00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.360    when you leave here remember to honor        240    00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.600    the work of all the people in your        241    00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.040    organization and especially those who        242    00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.839    are seldom        243    00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.160    recognized I have learned much about        244    00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.200    honor over many years of teaching a        245    00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.079    particular group of MBA        246    00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:34.800    students veterans who arrive at horror        247    00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.800    business school directly from their        248    00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.440    military service which in recent years        249    00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.800    has often included tours of Iraq or        250    00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.399    Afghanistan we have more than 50 of        251    00:11:45.399 --> 00:11:47.120    these students graduating        252

commitment that in some cases        255    00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.720    includes risking their        256    00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.320    lives we should all take every        257

   00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310    I live with two other Kennedy school        2    00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.049    students and so obviously the first        3    00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.430    thing you see when you walk into our        4    00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.950    apartment is a huge poster of John F        5    00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.910    Kennedy it's May of 1960 in the thick of        6    00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.009    the Democratic presidential primary and        7    00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.540    he's got this great big grin on his face        8    00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.789    as he holds up a newspaper with the        9    00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.910    headline Jack Kennedy is on the road to        10    00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:29.310    glory one night on my way to bed that        11    00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.070    poster froze me as I went to turn out        12    00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.950    the light it's only 8 months before        13    00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.200    Kennedy becomes president in only three        14    00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.870    and a half years before he is killed and        15    00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.520    he is so young when JFK died he was 46        16    00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.100    years old        17    00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.350    imagine do you could have intervened if        18    00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.879    you could somehow step through that        19    00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.100    poster and warn him before he becomes        20    00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.399    president of what lies ahead would he        21    00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.039    still have Bushido I think he would I        22    00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:02.789    think he would have said that the        23    00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.379    problems we faced were too urgent that        24    00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.720    the need to act was too strong whatever        25    00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.570    the cost I wonder as we get ready to        26    00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.040    walk out these gates whether we face a        27    00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.369    version of the same choice each of us        28    00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.920    has our own hopes and passions and        29    00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.659    callings and each of those comes with        30    00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.060    its own risks are we prepared to pursue        31    00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.430    them and to pay the cost that may come        32    00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.400    with that choice the terrifying thing        33    00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.590    about today is that you work so hard to        34    00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.509    come here and then suddenly it's over        35    00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.750    dreams diaries essays exams I feel like        36    00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.820    it's been half my life taking the GRE        37    00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.119    and then you get here and you realize        38    00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.610    it's not an ending but a beginning the        39    00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.790    word commencement is carefully chosen        40    00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.890    this is not a summit Concord or over the        41    00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.110    foothills of a new mountain and a steep        42    00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.200    path ahead it's only a steep path but a        43    00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.570    forked one with crossroads latent with        44    00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.850    danger I wonder if some of you have also        45    00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.130    had some sleepless nights recently as we        46    00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.869    ask ourselves tough questions about the        47    00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.729    choices we will make and by extension        48    00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.009    the people that we will be it's like a        49    00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.140    moment of vertigo of looking down        50    00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.140    unexpectedly from a great height and so        51    00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.819    we quickly busy ourselves again in the        52    00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.230    frenzy of life        53    00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.050    HKS in quorum calls and bidding wars and        54    00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.849    cheap coffees at Dunkin Donuts and        55    00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.459    overpriced drinks at park we don't stand        56    00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.500    still for fear or fooling one thing I've        57    00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.709    learned here is how much I don't know        58    00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.160    I still remember day one and my sense of        59    00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.190    awe when I first met my mpa classmates        60    00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.230    now this may seem strange given at day        61    00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.180    one it's also with me that the 15        62    00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.220    seconds of fame introductions when we        63    00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.349    MPs learned that one of our classmates        64    00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.209    as a killer Donald Duck impression        65    00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.310    another burps on command and the third        66    00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.069    sings a beautiful Argentinian tango but        67    00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.370    you were so impressive with skills and        68    00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.930    experiences and languages from every        69    00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.780    corner of the earth we are a very        70    00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.540    diverse group from former teachers by        71    00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.849    myself to economists and entrepreneurs        72    00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.160    and well let's face it policy geeks in        73    00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.650    pretty much every field imaginable we        74    00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.299    have come from very different places and        75    00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.859    our pastor once again about to diverge        76    00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.060    but there is one thing about the road        77    00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.000    ahead that unites us there were others        78    00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.709    thousands of others who wanted to study        79    00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.359    here and he couldn't because we got to        80    00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.700    be here instead we have not yet earned        81    00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.530    these seats JFK walked out of Harvard        82    00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.319    into a world at war we walk into one        83    00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.690    that are still shaped by tumult there is        84    00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.989    still full of hunger and fear in this        85    00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.150    room there are some serious student        86    00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.709    loans that needs to be paid back there        87    00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.049    are families to support in these two        88    00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.989    years we have had births and        89    00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.489    bereavements we have hell engagements        90    00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.190    and breakups my guess is that life is        91    00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.720    going to keep getting more complicated        92    00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.010    not less but as we go into the world its        93    00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.060    challenges are now upon us there's no        94    00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.829    class here that could have taught us        95    00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.500    courage can only be exercised on        96    00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.829    conditions of uncertainty or fear as our        97    00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.569    stato said courage can only be learned        98    00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.650    by performing courageous acts to        99    00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.609    commence is to begin as JFK said in his        100    00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.769    inaugural address last weekend

   do I have to admit primarily because I        9    00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.199    can't deny it as it was leaked in the        10    00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.320    Wikileaks release of the Sony hack that        11    00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.600    when I was invited I replied and I        12    00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.719    directly quote my own email wow this is        13    00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.079    so nice I'm going to need some funny        14    00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.120    ghost riders any        15    00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.879    ideas this initial response now        16    00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.640    blessedly public was from the knowledge        17    00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.559    that at my class day we were lucky        18    00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.520    enough to have will frell as class day        19    00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.760    speaker and that many of us hung over or        20    00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.800    even freshly High mainly wanted to laugh        21    00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.640    so I have to admit that today even 12        22    00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.040    years after graduation I'm still        23    00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.799    insecure about my own worthiness I have        24    00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.159    to remind myself today you are here for        25    00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.280    a reason today I feel much like I did        26    00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.960    when I came to Harvard Yard as a        27    00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.439    freshman in 1999 when you guys were to        28    00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.479    my continued shock and horror still in        29    00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.680    kindergarten I felt like there had been        30    00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.119    some mistake that I wasn't smart enough        31    00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.040    to be in this company and that every        32    00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.000    time I opened my mouth I would have to        33    00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.799    prove I wasn't just a dumb actress so I        34    00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.320    start with an apology this won't be very        35    00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.040    funny I'm not a comedian and I didn't        36    00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.759    get a ghost riter but I am here to tell        37    00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.560    you today Harvard is giving you all        38    00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.320    diplomas tomorrow you are here for a        39    00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.079    reason sometimes your insecurities and        40    00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.880    your inexperience may lead you too to        41    00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.000    embrace other people's expectations        42    00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.079    standards or values but you can harness        43    00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.280    that inexperience to carve out your own        44    00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.159    path one that is free of the burden of        45    00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.840    knowing how things are supposed to be a        46    00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.560    path that is defined by its own        47    00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.080    particular set of        48    00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.480    reasons the other day I went to an        49    00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.120    amusement park with my soon Tobe        50    00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.519    four-year-old son and I watched him play        51    00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.519    Arcade games he was incredibly focused        52    00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.280    throwing his ball at the Target Jewish        53    00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.800    mother that I am I skipped 20 steps and        54    00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.560    was already imagining him as a major        55    00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.519    league player with what his his aim and        56    00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.000    his arm and his        57    00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.200    concentration but then I realized that        58    00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.800    when he won he was playing to trade in        59    00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.720    his tickets for the crappy plastic toys        60    00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.000    the prize was much more exciting than        61    00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.920    the game to get it I of course wanted to        62    00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.879    urge him to take joy and the challenge        63    00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.159    of the game the Improvement of pron        64    00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.400    practice the satisfaction of doing        65    00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.319    something well and even feeling the        66    00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.080    accomplishment when achieving the game's        67    00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.319    goals but all of these aspects were        68    00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.840    shaded by the little 10-cent plastic men        69    00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.640    with sticky stretchy blue arms that        70    00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.519    adhere to the walls that that was the        71    00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.879    prize in a child's nature we see many of        72    00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.920    our own innate Tendencies I saw myself        73    00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.080    in him and perhaps you do too prizes        74    00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.280    serve as false Idols everywhere Prestige        75    00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.920    Wealth Fame power you will be exposed to        76    00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.959    many of these if not all of course part        77    00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.239    of why I was in invited to come speak        78    00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.280    today beyond my being a proud Alum is        79    00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.439    that I've crewed some very coveted toys        80    00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.959    in my life including a not so plastic        81    00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.319    not so crappy one an Oscar so we bump up        82    00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.239    against a common Trope I think of the        83    00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.879    commencement address people who have        84    00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.599    achieved a lot telling you that the        85    00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.560    fruits of achievement are not always to        86    00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.680    be trusted but I think that        87    00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.879    contradiction can be reconciled and is        88    00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.319    in fact instructive achievement is        89    00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.280    wonderful when you know why you're doing        90    00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.400    it and when you don't know it can be a        91    00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.280    terrible trap I went to a public high        92    00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.920    school on Long Island sasid High        93    00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.360    School oh hello        94    00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.000    saset the girls I went to school with        95    00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.959    had Prada bags and flat ironed hair and        96    00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.760    they spoke with an accent I who would        97    00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.680    move there at age n from Connecticut        98    00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.400    mimic to fit in Florida oranges        99    00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.440    chocolate cherries since I'm ancient and        100    00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.959    the internet was just starting when I        101    00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.080    was in high school people didn't really        102    00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.560    pay that much attention to the fact that        103    00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.800    I was an actress I was known mainly at        104    00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.440    school for having a backpack bigger than        105    00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.280    I was and always having white out on my        106    00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.160    hands as I hated seeing anything crossed        107    00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.960    out in my notebooks I was voted for my        108    00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.919    senior yearbook most likely to be a        109    00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.400    contestant on Jeopardy or code for        110    00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.039    nerdiest when I got to Harvard just        111    00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.240    after the release of Star Wars episode        112    00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.919    one I knew I would be starting over in        113    00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.240    terms of how people viewed me I feared        114    00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.880    people would assume I had gotten in just        115    00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.680    for being famous and that they would        116    00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.960    think I was not worthy of the        117    00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.000    intellectual rigor here and they would        118    00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.360    not have been far from the truth when I        119    00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.160    came here I had never written a 10-page        120    00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.960    paper before I'm not even sure I'd        121    00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.600    written a five-page paper I was alarmed        122    00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.520    and intimidated by the calm eyes of        123    00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.400    fellow students who came here from        124    00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.360    Dalton or exitor who thought that        125    00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.880    compared to high school the workload        126    00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.320    here was easy I was completely        127    00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.080    overwhelmed and thought that reading a        128    00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.199    thousand Pages a week was unimaginable        129    00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.080    that writing a 50-page thesis was just        130    00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.600    something I could never do I had no        131    00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.000    ideas how to declare I had no idea how        132    00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.600    to declare my intentions I couldn't even        133    00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.039    articulate them to myself I'd been        134    00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.080    acting since I was 11 but I thought        135    00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.319    acting was too frivolous and certainly        136    00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:38.880    not meaningful I came from a family of        137    00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.720    academics and was very concerned with        138    00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.680    being taken seriously in contrast to my        139    00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.479    inability to declare myself on my first        140    00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.960    day of orientation freshman year five        141    00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.720    separate students introduced themselves        142    00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.560    to me by saying I'm going to be        143    00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.160    president remember I told you        144    00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.400    that their names for the record were        145    00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.440    Bernie Sanders Mark Rubio Ted Cruz        146    00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.440    Barack Obama and Hillary        147    00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.199    Clinton in all seriousness I believed        148    00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:10.400    every one of them their bearing and        149    00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.639    self-confidence alone seemed proof of        150    00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:15.199    their prophecy where I couldn't shake        151    00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:17.520    myself self-doubt I got in only because        152    00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.520    I was famous this was how others saw me        153    00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.199    it was how I saw myself driven by these        154    00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:24.120    insecurities I decided that I was going        155    00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.639    to find something to do at Harvard that        156    00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:27.440    was serious and meaningful that would        157    00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.039    change the world and make it a better        158    00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.080    place        159    00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.840    at the age of 18 I had already been        160    00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.240    acting for seven years and assumed I'd        161    00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.599    find a more serious and profound path in        162    00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:39.440    college so freshman fall I decided to        163    00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.960    take neurobiology and advanced modern        164    00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.039    Hebrew literature because I was serious        165    00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:45.039    and        166    00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:47.440    intellectual needless to say I should        167    00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.680    have failed both I got bees for your        168    00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.639    information and to this day every Sunday        169    00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:54.080    I burn a small Effigy to the pagan gods        170    00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.520    of great        171    00:06:57.039 --> 00:06:59.479    inflation but as I was fighting my way        172    00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:02.080    way through alive bet yahushua in Hebrew        173    00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.759    and the different mechanisms of neural        174    00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:06.000    response I saw friends around me writing        175    00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.240    papers on sailing and pop culture        176    00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.160    magazines and professors teaching        177    00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.800    classes on Fairy Tales and The Matrix I        178    00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.680    realized that seriousness for serious        179    00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.080    seriousness is sake was its own kind of        180    00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.879    Trophy and a dubious one a pose I sought        181    00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:23.080    to counter some half imagined argument        182    00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.560    about who I was there was a reason I was        183    00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.440    an actor I love what I do and I saw from        184    00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.319    my peers and my mentors that that was        185    00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:32.840    not only an acceptable reason it was the        186    00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.759    best reason when I got to my graduation        187    00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:38.319    sitting where you sit today after four        188    00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:40.240    years of trying to get excited about        189    00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.400    something else I admitted to myself that        190    00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.280    I couldn't wait to go back and make more        191    00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.000    films I wanted to tell stories to        192    00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.199    imagine the lives of others and help        193    00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:51.720    others do the same I had found or        194    00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.120    perhaps reclaimed my reason you have a        195    00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.199    prize now or at least you will tomorrow        196    00:07:58.199 --> 00:07:59.919    the prize as a Harvard degree in your        197    00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:03.159    hand but what is your reason behind it        198    00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:05.039    my Harvard degree represents for me the        199    00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:06.599    Curiosity and invention that we're        200    00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:08.720    encouraged here the friendships I've        201    00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.080    sustained the way Professor Graham told        202    00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.039    me not to describe the way light hit a        203    00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:15.280    flower but rather the shadow that the        204    00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.879    flower cast the way Professor scary        205    00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:19.919    talked about theater as a transformative        206    00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:22.159    religious Force how Professor klin        207    00:08:22.159 --> 00:08:24.199    showed how much of our visual cortex is        208    00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:27.199    activated just by imagining now granted        209    00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:28.720    these things don't necessarily help me        210    00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.440    answer the most common questions I'm        211    00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.320    asked what designer are you wearing        212    00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.599    what's your Fitness regime any makeup        213    00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:37.279    tips but I have never since been        214    00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:39.680    embarrassed to myself ask what I might        215    00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.760    previously have thought was a stupid        216    00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.360    question my Harvard degree and other        217    00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.160    awards are emblems of the experiences        218    00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.680    which led me to them the wood panel        219    00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.360    lecture Halls the colorful fall leaves        220    00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.880    the hot vanilla tokin reading great        221    00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.200    novels in overstuffed library chairs        222    00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.800    running through dining Halls screaming        223    00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.360    ooh ah City step City step City step        224    00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.760    City step        225    00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:08.480    wooo it's easy now to romanticize my        226    00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.240    time here but I had some very difficult        227    00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.279    times here        228    00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:15.959    too some combination of being 19 dealing        229    00:09:15.959 --> 00:09:18.120    with my first heartbreak taking birth        230    00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.920    control pills that have since been taken        231    00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.680    off the market for their depressive side        232    00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.519    effects and spending too much time        233    00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:25.880    missing daylight during winter months        234    00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.920    led me into some pretty dark moments        235    00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.200    particularly during sophomore year there        236    00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.120    were several occasions I started crying        237    00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.560    in meetings with professors overwhelmed        238    00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.320    with what I was supposed to pull off        239    00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.839    when I could barely get myself out of        240    00:09:37.839 --> 00:09:40.120    bed in the morning moments when I took        241    00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.800    on the motto for my school work done not        242    00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.600    good if only I could finish my work even        243    00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.560    if it took eating a jumbo pack of Sour        244    00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.240    Patch Kids to get me through a single        245    00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.480    10-page Paper I felt that I had        246    00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.600    accomplished a great feat I'd repeat to        247    00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.800    myself done not        248    00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.279    good A couple of years ago I went to to        249    00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:01.000    Tokyo with my husband and I ate at the        250    00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000    most remarkable sushi restaurant I don't        251    00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.880    even eat fish I'm vegan so that tells        252    00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.560    you how good it was even with just        253    00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.040    vegetables this Sushi was the stuff you        254    00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.200    dream about the restaurant had six seats        255    00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.440    my husband and I marveled at how anyone        256    00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.800    could make rice so Superior to all other        257    00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.839    rice we wondered why they didn't make a        258    00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:21.320    bigger restaurant and be the most        259    00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.720    popular place in town our local friends        260    00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.640    explain to us that all the best        261    00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.640    restaurants in Tokyo are that small and        262    00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.079    do only one type of dish Sushi or        263    00:10:30.079 --> 00:10:32.800    tempora or Teriyaki because they want to        264    00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.079    do that thing well and beautifully and        265    00:10:35.079 --> 00:10:37.079    it's not about quantity it's about        266    00:10:37.079 --> 00:10:39.000    taking pleasure in the Perfection and        267    00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.360    beauty of the particular I'm still        268    00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.040    learning now that it's about good and        269    00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.600    maybe never done that the joy and work        270    00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.519    ethic and virtuosity we bring to the        271    00:10:48.519 --> 00:10:51.200    particular can impart a singular type of        272    00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.200    enjoyment to those we give to and of        273    00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.800    course to ourselves in my professional        274    00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.560    life it also took me time to find my own        275    00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.320    reasons for doing my work the first film        276    00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.959    I was in came out in 1994 again        277    00:11:04.959 --> 00:11:07.160    appallingly the year most of you were        278    00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.040    born I was 13 years old upon the film's        279    00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.920    release and I can still quote what the        280    00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.639    New York Times said about me verbatim        281    00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:18.079    Miss Portman poses better than she acts        282    00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:19.920    the film had a universally tepid        283    00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.079    critical response and went on to bomb        284    00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:24.040    commercially that film was called the        285    00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.399    professional or Layon in Europe and        286    00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:29.760    today 20 years and 35 films later it is        287    00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.519    still the film people approach me about        288    00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:33.639    the most to tell me how much they loved        289    00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:35.560    it how much it moved them how it's their        290    00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.079    favorite movie I feel lucky that my        291    00:11:38.079 --> 00:11:40.320    first experience releasing a film was        292    00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.480    initially such a disaster by all        293    00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.880    standard measures I learned early that        294    00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.120    my meaning had to be from the experience        295    00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.880    of making the film and the possibility        296    00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.240    of connecting with individuals rather        297    00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.680    than the foremost trophies of my        298    00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.800    industry financial and critical success        299    00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.880    and also that those initial reactions        300    00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.800    could be false predictors of your work's        301    00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.839    ultimate Legacy I started choosing only        302    00:12:02.839 --> 00:12:04.800    jobs I was passionate about and from        303    00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.639    which I knew I could glean meaningful        304    00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:09.120    experiences this thoroughly confused        305    00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.000    everyone around me agents producers and        306    00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.839    audiences alike I made Go's ghosts of        307    00:12:14.839 --> 00:12:16.920    foreign independent film and studied art        308    00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.720    history visiting the pra every day for        309    00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.760    four months as I read about Goya and the        310    00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.680    Spanish Inquisition I made V for        311    00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.720    Vendetta Studio action movie for which I        312    00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.199    learned everything I could about Freedom        313    00:12:26.199 --> 00:12:27.639    Fighters who in other eyes might be        314    00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:29.800    called terrorists from an akam big into        315    00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.600    the Weather Underground I made your        316    00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.600    highness a pothead comedy with Danny        317    00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.760    McBride and laughed for 3 months        318    00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.600    straight I was able to own my meaning        319    00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.880    and not have it be determined by box        320    00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.600    office receipts or Prestige by the time        321    00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.680    I got to making Black Swan the        322    00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.519    experience was entirely my own I felt        323    00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:50.440    immune to the worst things anyone could        324    00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.480    say or write about me unto whether an        325    00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.680    audience felt like going to see my movie        326    00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.560    or not it was instructive for me to see        327    00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.279    that ballet dancers for ballet dancers        328    00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:02.000    once your Technique gets to a certain        329    00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.480    level the only thing that separates you        330    00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.959    from others is your quirks or even flaws        331    00:13:07.959 --> 00:13:09.680    one ballerina was famous for how she        332    00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.000    turned slightly off balance you can        333    00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.440    never be the best technically someone        334    00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.880    will always have a higher jump or a more        335    00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.279    beautiful line the only thing you can be        336    00:13:19.279 --> 00:13:22.800    the best at is developing your own self        337    00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.480    authoring your own experience was very        338    00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.000    much what Black Swan itself was about I        339    00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.519    worked with Darren aronowski the film's        340    00:13:28.519 --> 00:13:30.279    director ctor to change my last line in        341    00:13:30.279 --> 00:13:33.160    the movie to it was perfect because my        342    00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.480    character Nina is only artistically        343    00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.680    successful when she finds Perfection and        344    00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.160    pleasure for herself not when she's        345    00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.560    trying to be perfect in the eyes of        346    00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.279    others so when Black Swan was successful        347    00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:45.199    financially and I began receiving        348    00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:47.639    accolades I felt honored and grateful to        349    00:13:47.639 --> 00:13:49.760    have connected with people but the true        350    00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.800    core of my meaning I had already        351    00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.759    established and I needed it to be        352    00:13:53.759 --> 00:13:56.519    independent of people's reactions to me        353    00:13:56.519 --> 00:13:58.199    people told me that Black Swan was an        354    00:13:58.199 --> 00:14:00.880    artistic risk a scary challenge to try        355    00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.040    to Port portray a professional ballet        356    00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.199    dancer but it didn't feel like courage        357    00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:07.560    or daring that Drew me to it I was so        358    00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.759    oblivious to my own limits that I did        359    00:14:09.759 --> 00:14:12.560    things I was woefully unprepared to do        360    00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.720    and so the very inexperience that in        361    00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.880    college had made me feel insecure and        362    00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.360    made me want to play by others rules now        363    00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.680    was making me actually take risks I        364    00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.199    didn't even realize were risks when        365    00:14:24.199 --> 00:14:26.040    Darren asked me if I could do ballet I        366    00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.399    told him that I was basically a        367    00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:29.600    ballerina which by by the way I        368    00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.399    wholeheartedly believed when it quickly        369    00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:34.880    became clear in preparing for the film        370    00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.639    that I was maybe 15 years away from        371    00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:38.800    being in ballerina it made me work a        372    00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.959    million times harder and of course the        373    00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:42.959    magic of Cinema and body doubles helped        374    00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:45.560    the final effect but the point is if I        375    00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.880    had known my own limitations I never        376    00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.880    would have taken the risk and the risk        377    00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.720    led to one of my greatest artistic and        378    00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.000    personal experiences and that I not only        379    00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.079    felt completely free I also met my        380    00:14:56.079 --> 00:14:57.680    husband during        381    00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.279    filming similarly I just directed my        382    00:15:00.279 --> 00:15:02.600    first film a tale of love and darkness        383    00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.399    and was quite blind to the challenges        384    00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:07.079    ahead of me the film is a period film        385    00:15:07.079 --> 00:15:09.560    completely in Hebrew in which I also act        386    00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.880    with an 8-year-old child as a co-star        387    00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.519    all of these are challenges I should        388    00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:15.399    have been terrified of as I was        389    00:15:15.399 --> 00:15:17.720    completely unprepared for them but my        390    00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.199    complete ignorance as to my own        391    00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:21.600    limitations looked like confidence and        392    00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.839    got me into the director's chair once        393    00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:25.880    there I had to figure it all out and my        394    00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.680    belief that I could handle these things        395    00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.800    contrary to all evidence of my ability        396    00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.319    to do so was half the battle the other        397    00:15:32.319 --> 00:15:35.639    half was very hard work the experience        398    00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:37.399    was the deepest and most meaningful one        399    00:15:37.399 --> 00:15:39.959    of my career now clearly I'm not urging        400    00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:41.800    you to go perform heart surgery without        401    00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.480    the knowledge to do so making movies        402    00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.880    admittedly has less drastic consequences        403    00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.880    than most professions and allows for a        404    00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.519    lot of effects that make up for mistakes        405    00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:53.800    the thing I'm saying is make use of the        406    00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.639    fact that you don't doubt yourself too        407    00:15:55.639 --> 00:15:58.240    much right now as we get older we get        408    00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.920    more realistic and that gets and that        409    00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.319    that includes about our own abilities or        410    00:16:04.319 --> 00:16:07.240    lack thereof and that realism does us no        411    00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.720    favors people always talk about diving        412    00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.600    into things you're afraid of that never        413    00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.839    worked for me if I'm afraid I run away        414    00:16:14.839 --> 00:16:16.839    and I would probably urge my child to do        415    00:16:16.839 --> 00:16:20.279    the same fear protects us in many ways        416    00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:22.519    what has served me is diving into my own        417    00:16:22.519 --> 00:16:24.759    obliviousness being more confident than        418    00:16:24.759 --> 00:16:26.519    I should be which everyone tends to        419    00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:28.800    decry in American kids and those of us        420    00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.600    who have been grade inflated and ego        421    00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.800    inflated well it can be a good thing if        422    00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.519    it makes you try things you never might        423    00:16:34.519 --> 00:16:37.120    have tried your inexperience is an asset        424    00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.800    and will allow you to think in original        425    00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.399    unconventional ways accept your lack of        426    00:16:41.399 --> 00:16:43.920    knowledge and use it as your asset I        427    00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.040    know a famous violinist who told me that        428    00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.079    he can't compose because he knows too        429    00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:49.800    many pieces so when he starts thinking        430    00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.199    of a note an existing piece immediately        431    00:16:52.199 --> 00:16:54.959    comes to mind just starting out one of        432    00:16:54.959 --> 00:16:56.600    your biggest strengths is not knowing        433    00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.560    how things are supposed to be you you        434    00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.519    can compose freely because your mind is        435    00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:02.880    encl cluttered with too many pieces and        436    00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.439    you don't take for granted the way        437    00:17:04.439 --> 00:17:06.760    things are the only way you know how to        438    00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.120    do things is your own way you here will        439    00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.319    all go on to achieve great things there        440    00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:15.039    is no doubt about that each time you set        441    00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:16.720    out to do something new your        442    00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.360    inexperience can either lead you down a        443    00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.360    path where you will conform to someone        444    00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.160    else's values or you can forge your own        445    00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.880    path even if you don't realize that's        446    00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.880    what you're doing if your reasons are        447    00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.120    your own your path even if it's a        448    00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.520    strange and clumsy path will be wholly        449    00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.679    yours and you will control the rewards        450    00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:36.600    of What You Do by making your internal        451    00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.120    life        452    00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.760    fulfilling at the risk of sounding like        453    00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.559    a Miss America contestant the most        454    00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:46.280    fulfilling things I've experienced have        455    00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.039    truly been the

465    00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.280    a cliche because it's true that helping        466    00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.159    others ends up helping you more than        467    00:18:11.159 --> 00:18:13.799    anyone getting out of your own concerns        468    00:18:13.799 --> 00:18:15.600    and caring about someone else's life for        469    00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.120    a while reminds you that you are not the        470    00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.360    center of the universe and that in the        471    00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.200    ways we are generous or not we can        472    00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.600    change the course of someone's life even        473    00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.919    at work the small Feats of kindness crew        474

impact and of course first and foremost        477    00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.039    the center of my world is the love I        478    00:18:37.039 --> 00:18:39.760    share with my family and friends I wish        479    00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.559    for you that your friends will be with        480    00:18:41.559 --> 00:18:43.640    you through it all as my friends from        481    00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.360    Harvard have been together since we        482    00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.880    graduated my friends from school are        483    00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.320    still very close we have nursed each        484    00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.200    other through heartaches and danced at        485    00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.080    each other's weddings we've held each        486    00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.000    other at funerals and rocked each        487    00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.159    other's new babies we've worked together        488    00:18:58.159 --> 00:19:00.200    on run projects helped each other get        489    00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.440    jobs and thrown parties for when we've        490    00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.960    quit bad ones and now our children are        491    00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.520    creating a second generation of        492    00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.840    friendship as we look at them toddling        493    00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.840    together Haggard and disheveled working        494    00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.679    parents that we are grab the good people        495    00:19:13.679 --> 00:19:16.159    around you don't let them go the biggest        496    00:19:16.159 --> 00:19:18.080    asset the school offers you is a group        497    00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.679    of peers that will be both your family        498    00:19:20.679 --> 00:19:22.520    and your school for        499    00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.679    life I remember always being pissed at        500    00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:29.159    the spring here in Cambridge tricking us        501    00:19:29.159 --> 00:19:31.400    into remembering a sunny yard full of        502    00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.200    laughing th frisbee throwers after eight        503    00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.840    months of dark frigid Library dwelling        504    00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.760    it was like the school had managed to        505    00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.840    turn on the good weather as a last        506    00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.600    memory we should keep in mind that would        507    00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.080    make us want to come back but as I get        508    00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.360    farther away from my years here I know        509    00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.240    that the power of this school is much        510    00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.600    deeper than weather control it changed        511    00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.400    the very questions I was asking to quote        512    00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.480    one of my favorite thinkers Abraham        513    00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.360    Joshua hesel to be or not to be is not        514    00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.880    the question the vital question is how        515    00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.799    to be and how not to be thank you I        516    00:20:04.799 --> 00:20:06.840    can't wait to see how you do all the        517    00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.799    beautiful things you will        518    00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.400    do

   00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.870    in every Harvard dorm there is a little        2    00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.160    piece of history        3    00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.709    a small red landline phone most of us        4    00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.449    probably disconnected it on our first        5    00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.760    day and stashed it in the back of a        6    00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.000    closet or under a futon but imagine for        7    00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.890    a moment we left that red phone        8    00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.530    connected and imagine that it rang        9    00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.740    we'd have no idea who was calling or        10    00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.140    what they needed or even if the call was        11    00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.500    meant for us the only way to find out        12    00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.700    would be to pick up now we all have cell        13    00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.880    phones to make us more connected but we        14    00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.760    are all so busy that usually when we get        15    00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.210    a call we rush to silence it we wonder        16    00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.890    why didn't they just text me I received        17    00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.860    a call about a year ago from a 16 year        18    00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.739    old friend of mine named Avery Avery had        19    00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.770    leukemia and I had had lymphoma several        20    00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.660    years earlier        21    00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.929    so naturally we talked about sports on        22    00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:08.969    this particular phone call he told me        23    00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:10.709    about his make-a-wish trip to the Super        24    00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:12.990    Bowl with Jamie Foxx in Leonardo        25    00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.130    DiCaprio Leo was the man he told me he        26    00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.119    was rocking this giant beard and I met        27    00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.149    Kate Upton and I was making her laugh        28    00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.219    and she even gave me a kiss I teased        29    00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:30.779    Avery that maybe there was still a        30    00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:32.729    chance he would get Kate Upton's number        31    00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.369    but in the meantime I was glad to hear        32    00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.759    he was doing so well        33    00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.499    tragically about a week later        34    00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:44.700    Avery passed away it wasn't fair what        35    00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.789    happens to Avery but I am always so        36    00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.700    grateful that he and I shared that phone        37    00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.020    call the warmth and the joy in his voice        38    00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.560    always give me strength a lot of things        39    00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.319    aren't fair at the beginning of the year        40    00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.840    Dean karana asked us do we want to        41    00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.029    prepare students for the world as it is        42    00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:10.710    or the world as we want it to be it is        43    00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.020    easy to disengage in the world as it is        44    00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.300    when we hear of the suffering of people        45    00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.170    from Iraq        46    00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.660    to Newtown when we know the globe is        47    00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.069    warming and the middle class is        48    00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.950    shrinking it is easy to think that no        49    00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.040    one can solve these big problems and to        50    00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.190    conclude that no one should try but it        51    00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.380    is also easy to disconnect in smaller        52    00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.900    moments it's easy to answer        53    00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.830    how are you with busy to end a        54    00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.020    conversation rather than feel vulnerable        55    00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.200    by opening up it's easy to sweetly lie        56    00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.580    to those people in Harvard Square        57    00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.540    holding clipboards I'll be back soon and        58    00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.900    then avoid them for the rest of the day        59    00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.489    it is easy to be unavailable because        60    00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.319    each of us is working on something        61    00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.040    important engaging requires us to choose        62    00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.519    empathy to set aside time for what is        63    00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.959    important to others but at Harvard in        64    00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.549    ways big and small we engaged        65    00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.069    we chose optimism over cynicism when we        66    00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.080    plan an educational trip to Israel and        67    00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.959    Palestine or we gave a voice to refugees        68    00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.150    the world had left in the dust of        69    00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.209    Western Tanzania we watched as fifth        70    00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.220    graders beamed at their state senator        71    00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.260    when she told them that they were all        72    00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.650    actually her boss it reminded us that        73    00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.260    our democratic political system so often        74    00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.519    a punch line can still inspire we chose        75    00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.549    to appreciate each other's gifts rather        76    00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.190    than view them as threats to our own we        77    00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.230    brought a latte to a friend up all night        78    00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.109    in a lab across campus we cheered        79    00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.079    together on Spring Break trips all over        80    00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.450    the world when Steve's take the shot to        81    00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.010    beat Yale as time expired        82    00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.680    we chose empathy when we respectfully        83    00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.190    disagree in class and said I just like        84    00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.670    to push back on that in these moments we        85    00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.660    glimpsed a world as we want it to be now        86    00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.190    as we are about to leave this place        87    00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.040    we're excited even Restless but we worry        88    00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.710    who we like our new job will we get into        89    00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.200    the right grad school will our parents        90    00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.370    keep paying our cell phone bill most of        91    00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.169    all I think we worry about losing our        92    00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.840    ability to choose next year it will be        93    00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.540    easy to stress about big meetings and        94    00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.000    important presentations because our        95    00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.729    bosses will tell us that they matter it        96    00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.350    will be easy to spend even more time        97    00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.570    being busy because that's how we're told        98    00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.090    to get ahead it will be easy to        99    00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.910    disengage and forget those special        100    00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.850    moments that we shared here but in this        101    00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.570    reality then before we worry about        102    00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.630    changing the world let's remember and        103    00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.330    let's choose not to let the world change        104    00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.900    us let's invite someone who looks lost        105    00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.270    to sit with us at lunch like we might        106    00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.910    have in Annenberg let's give our        107    00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.860    neighbor directions like we would to        108    00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.419    tourists looking for the John Harvard        109    00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.419    statue let's keep making time for our        110    00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.150    friends even when we have a million        111    00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.510    things we should be busy doing instead        112    00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.850    like we did when we went out for drinks        113    00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.900    after our roommates turned in their        114    00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.380    theses and like we did for more drinks        115    00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.970    when our roommates got their thesis        116    00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.110    grades back Harvard Graduate Robert        117    00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.090    Kennedy told South Africa under        118    00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.720    apartheid each time we act to improve        119    00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.419    the lot of others we send forth a tiny        120    00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.960    ripple of hope crossing each other from        121    00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.820    a million different centers those        122    00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.740    ripples build a current which can sweep        123    00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.030    down the mightiest walls of oppression I        124    00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.750    see in front of me        125    00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.040    thousands of        126    00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.020    Ripple's toward a world as we want it to        127    00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.870    be I see in our collective imaginations        128    00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.880    and our combined actions the beginning        129    00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.020    of a mighty current Robert Kennedy's        130    00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.670    brother        131    00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.040    President Kennedy installed in the Oval        132    00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.830    Office a direct hotline to the head of        133    00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.020    the Soviet Union        134    00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.040    popularly depicted as a small red        135    00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.490    landline phone they used it in times of        136    00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.650    crisis to build a momentary connection        137    00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.330    to day it would be easy to pretend there        138    00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.570    is nothing we can do to disconnect to        139    00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.370    stash other people's problems in the        140    00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.040    back of a closet or under a futon but        141    00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.010    instead let's connect our red phones and        142    00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.430    make ourselves available for those small        143    00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.870    serendipitous moments when someone needs        144    00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.380    us let's engage even when it makes us        145    00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.290    feel vulnerable because how we treat        146    00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.800    each other        147    00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.920    bit by bit will affect how leaders treat        148    00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.600    leaders and how nations treat nations as        149    00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.640    we celebrate our commencement let's        150    00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.770    always remember that our diploma is not        151    00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.190    a piece of paper rather it is a call a        152    00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:25.540    call to see the world as it is and still        153    00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.060    choose to imagine a world as we want it        154    00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.660    to be right now the phone is ringing off        155    00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.750    the hook        156    00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.550    answering that call requires us to make        157    00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.240    time but when we answer I believe we        158    00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.760    will always be so grateful        159    00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.480    that we did        160    00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:51.909    you

and it is my absolute pleasure        4    00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.279    to be introducing the next speaker the        5    00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.439    one the only Ethan Gabriel Loy so Ethan        6    00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.039    first walked into my life at the onset        7    00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.279    of sophomore year one of my blockmates        8    00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.840    decided to take time off at the last        9    00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.960    minute so my roommates and I thought we        10    00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.040    had somehow beaten the dunster housing        11    00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.120    system and we're already making plans to        12    00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.840    make and transform this coveted extra        13    00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.079    room into the best bomber Man video game        14    00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.719    suite you have ever seen this side of        15    00:00:46.719 -->

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.600    right on into a33 and dropped his        19    00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.920    luggage down smack dab on top of our        20    00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.120    dreams and aspirations of creating the        21    00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.400    ultimate man        22    00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.920    cave however family and friends of the        23

have a happy ending        26    00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.200    unbeknownst to us we did win the housing        27    00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.240    game we got        28    00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.799    Ethan and let me tell you this guy is        29    00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.759    incredibly talented so I'm ecstatic that        30    00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.880    you will all be getting a glimpse at one        31    00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.920    of Ethan's many gifts before piecing out        32    00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.200    out of here but what's even more        33    00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.640    impressive to me Beyond his skill as a        34    00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.360    writer is his willingness to make        35    00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.920    himself vulnerable and try new things        36    00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.200    despite any lingering fears or        37    00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.240    apprehension and so without further Ado        38    00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.439    please put your hands together and        39    00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.040    welcome to the podium Ethan Gabriel        40    00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.840    Louie        41    00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.000    Ariana Grande once        42    00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.039    said don't ever doubt yourself or waste        43    00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.319    one second of your life it's too short        44    00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.720    and you're too        45    00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.120    special powerful        46    00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.480    words but I'm not just here to bombard        47    00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.800    you with incredibly profound        48    00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.200    quotes in fact I'm actually here to        49    00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.200    disagree with Miss Grande though it        50    00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.080    pains me to contradict such a prom        51    00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.879    cultural and intellectual        52    00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.200    leader at first glance her quote seems        53    00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.080    like a harmless collection of graduation        54    00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.800    speech cliches uh believe in yourself        55    00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.480    you're special you are all going to be        56    00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.920    president but let's take a closer look        57    00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.920    at this Gem of wisdom through the always        58    00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.720    helpful lens of academic        59    00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.760    analysis Miss Grande makes two normative        60    00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.000    statements that I would designate as        61    00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.480    potentially problematic        62    00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.920    firstly that life is too short and        63    00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.560    secondly that we are        64    00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.519    special maybe it's too long and we're        65    00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.080    not but I'd like to overlook these        66    00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.480    concerns for now to get to the most        67    00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.920    troubling piece of Miss Grande's advice        68    00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.680    don't ever doubt        69    00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.480    yourself don't ever doubt yourself first        70    00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.920    of all it's not realistic advice I'm        71    00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.319    sure that every one of us in our four        72    00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.920    years at Harvard has come to no        73    00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.159    self-doubt maybe we were un sure of our        74    00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.640    niche in the vast Harvard ecosystem or        75    00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.959    what career path we should follow after        76    00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.840    graduation maybe the doubt itself became        77    00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.360    a source of anxiety that we strove to        78    00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.560    silence to find airtight confidence and        79    00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.640    a straightforward path through life        80    00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.120    rather than struggle with the        81    00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.040    frightening and ambiguous challenges        82    00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.680    that self-doubt can        83    00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.799    present as graduates of a place like        84    00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.120    Harvard this type of evasive        85    00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.040    overconfidence can sneak up on us we're        86    00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.680    young we're successful we have Society        87    00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.799    stamp of approval everything's going        88    00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.120    right for us so we must be living Our        89    00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.959    Lives the right way but this        90    00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.280    closed-minded deterministic thinking        91    00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.480    while it can bring us Comfort can also        92    00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.720    blind us to meaningful        93    00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.320    introspection all too often we associate        94    00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.079    doubt with a lack of courage or        95    00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.120    confidence but today I'd like to argue        96    00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.360    just the opposite I think that to doubt        97    00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.919    yourself in an honest and unsparing way        98    00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.120    actually requires        99    00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.280    courage to question your path through        100    00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.039    life at age 22 or 52 is an act of        101    00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.479    humility that I hope we will not abandon        102    00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.320    the second we win our first paycheck or        103    00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.039    first award self-doubt is more than just        104    00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.199    a growing pain or a fixture of your        105    00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.280    final year at College it's something        106    00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.840    constructive something Illuminating that        107    00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.160    can guide us at any stage of        108    00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.440    life now uh just for the record yes uh I        109    00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.240    am aware that graduation speeches are        110    00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.479    supposed to be        111    00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.880    uplifting so if all this talk of Doubt        112    00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.320    is bringing you down I want to clarify        113    00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.400    the following friends classmates        114    00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.880    comrades you are wonderful and talented        115    00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.919    individuals but as young Harvard        116    00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.039    graduates we have no shortage of people        117    00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.160    telling us that we are great and while        118    00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.639    each and every one of us deserves the        119    00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.080    strength of self-belief let's try to        120    00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.880    balance it with the perspective of        121    00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.919    self-doubt now my personal balance has        122    00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.160    always been weighted a little more        123    00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.400    heavily towards doubt which is an        124    00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.800    understated way of saying that if        125    00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.680    competitive neuroticism were an Olympic        126    00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.160    sport I would be it's Michael        127    00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.680    Phelps But ultimately I'm grateful for        128    00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.440    my ability uh to question myself doubt        129    00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.440    can feel like a burden but I believe        130    00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.880    it's a burden worth        131    00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.360    carrying one especially positive aspect        132    00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.840    of Doubt is that it helps us think        133    00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.000    through our decisions and we've all had        134    00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.120    to make some big ones lately about where        135    00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.960    to go and what to do and why senior year        136    00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.720    is a time of tremendous doubt for many        137    00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.360    of us and in The Crucible of all that        138    00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.400    uncertainty it is so tempting to choose        139    00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.280    the safest or most popular options        140    00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.160    presented to us to make the lowrisk        141    00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.039    decision rather than the one that is        142    00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:09.319    true to our passion and        143    00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:11.800    ideals we've all faced some variant of        144    00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.759    this challenging Crossroads uh        145    00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.479    personally I've long wanted to be a        146    00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.479    teacher or maybe a writer uh but ever        147    00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.120    since my freshman year a great number of        148    00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.479    people from friends to family to drunk        149    00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:24.400    strangers on airplanes have told me that        150    00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.479    I should become a lawyer Ethan they'd        151    00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:30.759    say you're moderately good with words        152    00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:32.720    you have a loud dactic        153    00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.880    voice so it        154    00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.319    settled I never wanted to be a lawyer        155    00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:38.880    but the pressure came from a lot of        156    00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.240    places the aforementioned drunk stranger        157    00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.360    on drunk stranger on an airplane even        158    00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.240    told me that by coming by becoming a        159    00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.199    teacher or a writer I would be wasting        160    00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:49.880    my Harvard diploma but he then proceeded        161    00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.599    to open up Sky Mall and order a set of        162    00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:53.479    matching beer cozies so I think I can        163    00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:56.560    take that opinion with a grain of        164    00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:00.039    salt and yet despite having little        165    00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:02.360    passion or ability for it I almost        166    00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.759    applied to law school I had taken steps        167    00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:06.639    towards becoming a writer but no one was        168    00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:08.759    offering me a book contract and I was so        169    00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:10.919    petrified of being seen as a failure        170    00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:12.919    that I almost accepted a career I knew        171    00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:15.440    was not right for me simply because it        172    00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.960    felt        173    00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.879    safe as I learned from this experience        174    00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:22.199    some people have implicit assumptions        175    00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:23.400    about what Harvard students should do        176    00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.560    with their lives certain predetermined        177    00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.039    paths to a predetermined image of        178    00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:31.319    success and in the stressful tumultuous        179    00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:34.160    uncertainty of senior year it's easy and        180    00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.000    tempting to ignore our doubts and just        181    00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.759    go with the flow to be overwhelmed by        182    00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:42.440    the comforting Allure of money or        183    00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.000    Prestige and my fear is certainly not        184    00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000    that we will uh sell out that would be        185    00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.319    an unfair judgment to make uh everyone        186    00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:50.879    needs to pay the bills and I'm sure many        187    00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:52.759    of us will go on to be great        188    00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:55.159    philanthropists but I worry that by not        189    00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:56.800    sufficiently questioning our path        190    00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.759    through life we may struggle to find        191    00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:02.479    lives of joy and purposeful work as a        192    00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:04.360    member of the class of 2015 I've seen        193    00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.440    firsthand just how smart and capable you        194    00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.639    all are and how driven you are to make        195    00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:10.919    the world a better place which is why I        196    00:08:10.919 --> 00:08:12.919    would hate to see even one of us get        197    00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:15.120    stuck doing work we don't believe        198    00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.240    in now again to be clear I'm not saying        199    00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.680    there is anything wrong with being a        200    00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.879    lawyer or Banker or consultant or any        201    00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:24.639    job that falls under the umbrella of        202    00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:27.039    lucrative and prestigious the world        203    00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:29.080    needs talented good-hearted people to do        204    00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.280    these jobs but let's doubt the        205    00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.039    assumption that the most lucrative        206    00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.640    prestigious path is necessarily the best        207    00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.440    path for us above all let's pursue our        208    00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.839    prospective careers because we find them        209    00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:43.120    meaningful and I don't presume to tell        210    00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.880    you what makes a career meaningful I        211    00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.360    merely ask that we ask and ask        212    00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.680    rigorously don't repress your doubt        213    00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.480    confront it and if you haven't found        214    00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.399    your purpose yet keep searching because        215    00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:55.959    it is better to struggle with tough        216    00:08:55.959 --> 00:08:57.800    existential questions than to come up        217    00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.160    with forced or unsatisfying answers and        218    00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.079    better to fail in pursuit of a worthy        219    00:09:02.079 --> 00:09:05.000    goal than succeed in achieving a hollow        220    00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.560    one class of 2015 we have every reason        221    00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.320    to believe in ourselves but let's not be        222    00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.959    afraid to question ourselves as well        223    00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:15.320    doubt has helped me find some        224    00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.839    perspective on my future maybe it can do        225    00:09:17.839 --> 00:09:20.360    the same for you because we are all just        226    00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.399    searching for a meaningful path through        227    00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:25.279    life and if we keep asking questions I        228    00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:28.720    am confident not doubtful that we will        229    00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.839    find it        230    00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:31.200    thank you classmates thank you Harvard I        231    00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.060    love you        232    00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:37.520    [Applause]        233    00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.600    guys

   00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.319    shoot for the moon and if you fall short        2    00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.080    at least you'll be amongst the Stars        3    00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.160    it's a nice sentiment if only it were        4    00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.439    true it's more like shoot for the moon        5    00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.080    and if you fall short you'll be amongst        6    00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.160    the enormous amount of trash orbiting        7    00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.640    the        8    00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.960    earth now that's true so don't fall        9    00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.160    short or maybe best not to shoot for the        10    00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.520    moon like most people I'm open to taking        11    00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.280    risks as long as I'm guaranteed a        12    00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.719    positive outcome that comes at no cost        13    00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:44.520    to        14    00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.000    myself so when people say things like        15    00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.879    take risks be bold change the world I'm        16    00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.199    left with a burning unanswered        17    00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.960    question        18    00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.039    why especially since doing such things        19    00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.519    might actually kill        20    00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.400    me but the answer started to take shape        21    00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.720    during my time at Harvard with credit        22    00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.320    due to a former undergrad for the last 5        23    00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.240    years I've been a resident tutor in MA        24    00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240    house        25    00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.399    where it's truly been a joy to work with        26    00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.479    hundreds of amazing students to whom        27    00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.079    I've do out such insightful wisdom as do        28    00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.360    not go to grad        29    00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.159    school unless you're willing to endure        30    00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.520    long periods of failure on a daily basis        31    00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.560    punctuated only rarely by incremental        32    00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.970    progress am I        33    00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.439    [Applause]        34    00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.399    right one day over lunch a student told        35    00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.640    me she was nervous about talking to a        36    00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.920    professor about a low exam score before        37    00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.120    she left I said just remember that you        38    00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.160    have intrinsic worth apart from your        39    00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.519    accomplishments and she was stunned and        40    00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.040    said is that really        41    00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.360    true I mean doesn't everyone judge you        42    00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.400    based on your accomplishments        43    00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.560    oh        44    00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.319    right but the thing about intrinsic        45    00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.239    worth is that you have it inherently        46    00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.680    it's part of your personhood you can't        47    00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.599    earn it with accomplishments and        48    00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.040    therefore you can't lose it with        49    00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.879    failures nothing can take it        50    00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.879    away but it's easy to forget since the        51    00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.920    world often reduces us to the sum of our        52    00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.599    achievements and has a long memory of        53    00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.080    our failures        54    00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.360    it's tough to believe something if no        55    00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.560    one else affirms it even if it is        56    00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.879    true two weeks later I saw the same        57    00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.120    student on the M2 shuttle heading back        58    00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.560    to Cambridge from the medical school        59    00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.920    it's 2 miles away so during the next 45        60    00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.680    minutes on the        61    00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.319    bus she asked me how my research was        62    00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.080    going poorly as usual I replied and        63    00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.360    immediately he said well remember you        64    00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.239    have intrinsic worth apart from your        65    00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.439    accomplishments I had to smile a student        66    00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:42.760    actually remembered something I        67    00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.159    said but seriously her reminder really        68    00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.720    struck me and as I pondered it over the        69    00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.640    years I realized that intrinsic worth is        70    00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.400    at the core of resolving those nagging        71    00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.280    questions why take risks when they come        72    00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.480    at such a cost and how to even dare in        73    00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.680    the face of crushing        74    00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.319    failure having worth that cannot be lost        75    00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.480    provides the strength to persevere you        76    00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.840    have a reserve you can draw upon when        77    00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.239    everything is falling apart and you feel        78    00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.880    unjustly pressed on all sides not        79    00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.239    everything is on the line because even        80    00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.880    when you fail you still have worth you        81    00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.160    can still get up again failure doesn't        82    00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.080    have to destroy you which means you can        83    00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.280    afford to be bold to resist the crowd to        84    00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.680    do what's        85    00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.680    right usually challenges to take risks        86    00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.880    ultimately appeal to our narcissism with        87    00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.919    Promises of high risk High

us are jaded lowrisk High        91    00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:58.199    reward people it's also called being        92    00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.720    logical        93    00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.479    but recognizing intrinsic worth in other        94    00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.680    people broadens our perspective my        95    00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.000    student leader told me that knowing her        96    00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.400    own worth changed her life how much more        97    00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.759    lifechanging disruptive even would it be        98    00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.440    if we affirmed worth not only in        99    00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.160    ourselves but also in other people what        100    00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.759    if we acted like it wouldn't we be a bit        101    00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.080    more        102    00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.240    compassionate a bit more considerate in        103    00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.440    criticism a bit more courageous to fight        104    00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.479    injustice how different our news        105    00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.080    headlines would        106    00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.120    be a person has inherent value it's part        107    00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.520    of our shared humanity and that should        108    00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.319    compel us to act boldly for the sake of        109    00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:53.840    others even when it's        110    00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.960    costly recognizing intrinsic worth        111    00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.520    simultaneously motivates and sustains us        112    00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.000    to take those risks to change the world        113    00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.360    and we mustn't think that changing the        114    00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.280    world only applies to special people        115    00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.039    with special circumstances to help the        116    00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.759    poor or the sick or a developing country        117    00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:15.599    far        118    00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:19.720    away every person fundamentally desires        119    00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.759    to be fully known and fully loved        120    00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:26.080    despite their flaws in essence to have        121    00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.280    their intrinsic worth        122    00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.080    affirmed so as my student did for me        123    00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.319    remind each other in the midst of life's        124    00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.840    trivialities and great        125    00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.960    opportunities you have extraordinary        126    00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.720    worth apart from your accomplishments        127    00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.199    and nothing can remove it not even        128    00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:50.560    yourself and if you live confidence that        129    00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.199    your worth is already        130    00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:56.800    secure then you might actually begin to        131    00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.840    change the world        132    00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.840    w

new        69    00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.260    iPhone apps or huffing 5-hour energy in        70    00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.410    Lemont basement we all have different        71    00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.989    views of how Harvard should change some        72    00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.300    of us want smaller section sizes some of        73    00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.950    us want Harvard to divest from fossil        74    00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.580    fuels and some yeah and some of us just        75    00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.400    want more tomato basil ravioli soup        76    00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.459    and we all have different backgrounds we        77    00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.230    have students from all over the world        78    00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.769    like England or Kyrgyzstan or New York        79    00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:06.620    or New York or New York but through all        80    00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.389    these differences in experiences        81    00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.959    worldviews and backgrounds one thing has        82    00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.150    brought us together and guided all of        83    00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.980    our actions in an incredibly important        84    00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.620    way I'm not talking about the pursuit of        85    00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.440    Veritas or our hatred of Yale or even        86    00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.849    ghungroo I'm talking of course about the        87    00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.289    Harvard Student Handbook which this        88    00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.440    totally is that's right        89    00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.889    without this 185 page tome of rules and        90    00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.539    regulations governing this hallowed        91    00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.639    institution Harvard would be nothing        92    00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.090    more than a lawless wasteland without        93    00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.860    the Harvard Student Handbook Dean of the        94    00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.509    college Rakesh Khurana would have to        95    00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:50.090    rule Harvard Yard like a Mad Max road        96    00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.789    warrior running down underage drinkers        97    00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.070    with a HUP d segue affixed with railroad        98    00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.320    spikes confiscated key stones and the        99    00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.449    skulls of freshmen who snuck flats in        100    00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.720    the first chance dance without the        101    00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.820    Harvard Student Handbook president drew        102    00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.919    Faust would convene the ad board in the        103    00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.860    blood-stained Stadium granting intro to        104    00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.990    Congress students nothing more than a        105    00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.110    dull sword to defend against vows        106    00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.430    unfathomable fury her nicely pressed        107    00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.500    pantsuit and a trident        108    00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.759    without the harvard student handbook        109    00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.669    deena freshmen Tom Dingman would        110    00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:32.860    probably just keep being himself what a        111    00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.060    dude but luckily we didn't have to think        112    00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.840    about that        113    00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.330    class of 2015 because the Harvard        114    00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.189    Student Handbook has been there for us        115    00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:44.770    when we registered for classes every        116    00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.569    semester we entered a binding contract        117    00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:49.300    that protected us under sacred Harvard        118    00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.449    Law look how many of us actually read        119    00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:55.180    the Harvard student handbook section kid        120    00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.469    read it Mark Zuckerberg read it the I        121    00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:00.969    guess those folks who ran that satanic        122    00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:02.830    black mass thing probably read it pretty        123    00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.129    thoroughly but the rest of us probably        124    00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:09.159    didn't so who's to say we didn't enter a        125    00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:11.469    contract granting Harvard our firstborn        126    00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:14.889    child or selling Harvard our souls some        127    00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:16.750    of the employed among us may be used to        128    00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.300    such soul draining contracts shout out        129    00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.689    McKinsey totally kidding totally kidding        130    00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:26.830    I meant Bain kidding again I don't know        131    00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.879    the difference but for the rest of us        132    00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:33.129    I'll provide a little spark notes for        133    00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:34.629    the provisions of the Harvard Student        134    00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:36.159    Handbook that you may have missed        135    00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:38.529    in some ways the Harvard Student        136    00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:40.569    Handbook has guided us with simple        137    00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:43.240    directives standards of conduct part        138    00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.819    three don't steal general regulations        139    00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:48.219    part eight no radioactive materials on        140    00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:51.099    campus residential life part four        141    00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:53.199    bicycles may not be written in Harvard        142    00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.930    Yard these directives were simple and        143    00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.969    obvious to nearly all of us except for        144    00:06:57.969 --> 00:06:59.620    you idiots who rode bikes in the yard        145    00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.000    like honestly you people were the worst        146    00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.460    however not all regulations in the        147    00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.589    Harvard Student Handbook were so clear        148    00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:12.430    know some parts shifted and changed over        149    00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.159    our four years at this school like all        150    00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:17.909    great texts the Bible Plato's Republic        151    00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:22.190    The Hunger Games part three Mockingjay        152    00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.750    the Harvard Student Handbook has not        153    00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.450    been static and unchanging its meaning        154    00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.330    has evolved as we've matured the section        155    00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.300    about honesty comes to mind I quote the        156    00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.280    college expects that all students will        157    00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.140    be honest and forthcoming in their        158    00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.520    dealings with the members of this        159    00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.440    community        160    00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.060    freshman year this meant being really        161    00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.600    really honest with every other freshman        162    00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.580    you ever met in Annenberg about        163    00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.650    everything in your life during these        164    00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.990    meals I learned about the AP exam scores        165    00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.970    political affiliations political        166    00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.040    ambitions and deep-seated insecurities        167    00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.690    of just about every other freshman I met        168    00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.550    in Annenberg I even learned some        169    00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.910    people's names but after we transitioned        170    00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.650    to sophomore and junior year and realize        171    00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.600    that no one cared about our AP exam        172    00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.910    scores honesty came to mean something        173    00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.490    different in this in these two years we        174    00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.680    became honest with ourselves and found        175    00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.990    our place on campus be it with a        176    00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.640    talented group of performers in an        177    00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.830    acapella group with a committed crew of        178    00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.290    writers in a magazine or with the speed        179    00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:26.390    club for gentlemen but senior year this        180    00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.220    honesty extended to those outside the        181    00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.110    Harvard community as we all began to        182    00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.510    answer the perennial question what are        183    00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.210    you doing next year and answering this        184    00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.520    terrible terrible question honestly had        185    00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.280    to become a little more creative if we        186    00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.660    were going to be unemployed in our        187    00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.610    parents basement we told people that we        188    00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.450    were working on a start-up if we got a        189    00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.580    consulting or finance gig we told people        190    00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.550    we were moving to New York and if we        191    00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.530    were spending a year traveling without a        192    00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.790    job we told people we got a fellowship        193    00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:01.340    all these answers were honest albeit        194    00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.710    perhaps creative and interpretive and        195    00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.470    who said the aesthetic and interpretive        196    00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.210    understanding part of our gen ed        197    00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.680    requirement was worthless haha I did I        198    00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.380    said that but after tomorrow        199    00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.090    class of 2015 the Harvard Student        200    00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:20.000    Handbook will no longer bind us telling        201    00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.890    us to be honest and the rule of Harvard        202    00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.860    Law will no longer protect us it's been        203    00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.600    our Guardian through thick and thin        204    00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.120    through Hurricane Irene and Dean fee

is for all of us and it can        50    00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.959    be summed up in two words come out when        51    00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.580    was the last time you came out about        52    00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.000    something I don't just mean sexuality        53    00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.370    maybe you told someone you had a crush        54    00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.370    on them maybe you opened up about a        55    00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.580    hardship you have faced maybe you asked        56    00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.400    for help when you really needed it these        57    00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.799    are all different kinds of coming out        58    00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.890    these are all moments when you could        59    00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.180    have pretended that you were        60    00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.359    invulnerable but you chose to be open        61    00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.600    about the things that have kept you back        62    00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.049    the things that have kept you down the        63    00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.380    things you are afraid of when we are out        64    00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.470    about these things in our work in our        65    00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.680    relationships we allow ourselves to be        66    00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.680    the brilliant unruly people we are and        67    00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.440    we give each other permission to come        68    00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.630    out - we are about to graduate from        69    00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.720    Harvard University we are about to        70    00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.090    graduate from one of the most esteemed        71    00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.630    and wealthiest institutions in the world        72    00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.310    and we are about to become bosses I mean        73    00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.430    this colloquially I'm a boss you're a        74    00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.660    boss Natalie Portman is a boss but I        75    00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.600    mean this literally - a lot of us are        76    00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.600    about to become very powerful people and        77    00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.479    that's great because here at Harvard we        78    00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.610    have all the skills required of affect        79    00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.840    leadership decisiveness empathy        80    00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.590    determination except one when it comes        81    00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.860    to vulnerability we are a second rate as        82    00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.770    Yale and that makes sense it is hard to        83    00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.719    be out about the things that have kept        84    00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:53.180    us back when everyone around us is        85    00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.479    soaring many of us have been told that        86    00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.569    we are the wrong race or the wrong        87    00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:02.599    gender or from the wrong income bracket        88    00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.759    or with the wrong abilities or with the        89    00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.719    wrong passions to be truly great so we        90    00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:12.169    hide but if we are going to use the        91    00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.110    power we feel every time we tell someone        92    00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.330    where we go to school to make the world        93    00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.550    a better place we need to come out I        94

   00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.240    to not only be out about my sexuality        109    00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.069    but to write about it bi-weekly as a        110    00:06:16.069 -->

   than his own remarkable life from        16    00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.680    Chicago's South Side to the        17    00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.490    Massachusetts Statehouse when he was

their legal right to freedom        23    00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.880    John Quincy Adams Governor Patrick can        24    00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.730    claim connection with both the African        25    00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.900    heritage of the Amistad rebels and the        26    00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.110    institutional roots of their defender        27    00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.750    Adams as you heard before from president        28    00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.030    Torres was a member of the Harvard        29    00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.950    College class of

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.540    earlier alumnus John Adams of the class        33    00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.810    of 1755 that kind of continuity across        34    00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.140    the centuries is not the least of the        35    00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.049    reasons that we congregate here every        36    00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.440    spring to renew and reinforce our ties        37    00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.400    to this extraordinary play        38    00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.920    let me start by noticing what is both        39    00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.270    obvious and curious we are here today        40    00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.540    together we are here in association it's        41    00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.750    an association of many people and many        42    00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.260    generations we celebrate a connection        43    00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.400    across time in these festival rites        44    00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.290    singing our alma mater adorning        45    00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.200    ourselves in medieval robes to mark the        46    00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.170    deep-rooted traditions of Harvard and of        47    00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.590    universities more generally even in the        48    00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.580    age of the online in the virtual an        49    00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.519    institution has brought us together and        50    00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.180    brings us back we have also son or        51    00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.480    rather the Magnificent Renee Fleming his        52    00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.769    son America the Beautiful to honor        53    00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.890    another institution our Democratic        54    00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.650    Republic which the men and women whose        55    00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.380    names are carved in stone in Memorial        56    00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.530    Church right behind me and Memorial Hall        57    00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.860    just behind that gave their lives to        58    00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.329    protect and uphold when the founders of        59    00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.579    the Massachusetts Bay Colony arrived on        60    00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.519    these shores in 1630 they came as        61    00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.269    dissenters rejecting institutions of        62    00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.390    their English homeland but I've always        63    00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.190    found it striking that here in the        64    00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.760    wilderness        65    00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.519    we're mere survival was the foremost        66    00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.060    challenge they so rapidly felt compelled        67    00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.299    to found this seat of learning so that        68    00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.370    New England in the words of William        69    00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.590    Hubbard of the class of 1642 so that New        70    00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.590    England might be supplied with persons        71    00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.370    fit to manage the affairs of both church        72    00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:12.150    and state Church state and College three        73    00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.720    institutions they deemed essential to        74    00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.549    this Massachusetts experiment three        75    00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:20.739    institution        76    00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.430    to ensure that the colonists as Governor        77    00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.639    John Winthrop urged could be knit        78    00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.740    together as one in a new society in a        79    00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.680    brave new world        80    00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.539    dozens of generations have come and gone        81    00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.060    since then and the University's        82    00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.180    footprint has expanded considerably        83    00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.979    beyond a small cluster of wooden        84    00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.520    buildings but we have never lost faith        85    00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.150    in the capacity of each generation to        86    00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.419    build a better society than the one it        87    00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.349    was born into we have never lost faith        88    00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.580    in the capacity of this College to help        89    00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.020    make that possible        90    00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.680    as an early founder Thomas Sheppard put        91    00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.949    it we hope to graduate into the world        92    00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.610    people who are in his words enlarged        93    00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.319    toward the country and the good of it        94    00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.060    you have now nearly four centuries later        95    00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.030    we find ourselves in a challenging        96    00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.349    historical moment how do we enlarge our        97    00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:36.539    graduates a new job for the treasurer        98    00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.599    how do we enlarge our graduates in a way        99    00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:44.560    that benefits others as well Sheppard        100    00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.219    spoke of enlarging toward toward as he        101    00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:50.889    put it the country and the good of it        102    00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:55.530    are we succeeding in educating students        103    00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.250    oriented toward the betterment of others        104    00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.449    or have we all become so caught up in        105    00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:06.630    individual and personal achievements        106    00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.449    opportunities and appearances that we        107    00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.909    risk forgetting our interdependence our        108    00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:17.650    responsibilities to one another and to        109    00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.990    the institution's meant to promote the        110    00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.650    common good this is the era of the        111    00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.300    selfie and the selfie stick        112    00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.850    now don't get me wrong there's much to        113    00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.730    love about selfies and two years ago in        114    00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.280    my baccalaureate address I concluded by        115    00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.890    urging the graduates to send such        116    00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.140    pictures along so that we could keep up        117    00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.350    with them in their post Harvard lives        118    00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.740    but think for a moment about the        119    00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.350    implications of a society that goes        120    00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:54.720    through life taking its own picture that        121    00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.930    seems to me a quite literal embodiment        122    00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.760    of self regarding a term not often used        123    00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.080    as a compliment        124    00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.250    in fact merriam-webster dictionary        125    00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.040    offers egocentric narcissistic and        126    00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.840    selfish as synonyms we direct endless        127    00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.280    attention to ourselves our image our        128    00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.790    likes just as we are encouraged and in        129    00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.090    fact encourage our students to burnish        130    00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.450    resumes and fill first college and then        131    00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.300    job or graduate school applications with        132    00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.600    endless lists of achievements with        133    00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.080    examples to borrow Shepards language of        134    00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.260    constant enlargements of self as one        135    00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.050    social commentator has observed we are        136    00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.780    ceaselessly at work building our own        137    00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.710    brands we spend time looking at screens        138    00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.290    instead of one another large portions of        139    00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.750    our lives are hardly experienced they        140    00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.340    are curated shared snapchatted and        141    00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.470    Instagram rendered as a kind of        142    00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.780    composite selfie now a certain amount of        143    00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.050    self-absorption        144    00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.620    is in our nature as Harvard's own al        145    00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.660    Wilson has recently written and I quote        146    00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.970    him we are an insatiable curious species        147    00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.830    provided the subjects are our personal        148    00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.680    selves and people we would know or would        149    00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.550    like to know but I want to underscore        150    00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:33.690    two troubling aspects of this obsession        151    00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.500    with ourselves the first is it        152    00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.329    undermines our sense        153    00:08:39.329 --> 00:08:42.949    of responsibility to others the ethos of        154    00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:45.839    service at the heart of Thomas        155    00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:48.480    Sheppard's phrase describing Harvard's        156    00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.720    enduring commitment to graduate students        157    00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.220    who are enlarged to be about more than        158    00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.829    themselves not just enlarged for their        159    00:08:58.829 --> 00:09:01.889    own sake and betterment but enlarged        160    00:09:01.889 --> 00:09:06.149    toward others and toward the world this        161    00:09:06.149 --> 00:09:08.819    is part of the essence of what this        162    00:09:08.819 --> 00:09:12.989    university has always strived to be our        163    00:09:12.989 --> 00:09:15.149    students and faculty have embodied that        164    00:09:15.149 --> 00:09:17.369    spirit through their work to serve in        165    00:09:17.369 --> 00:09:19.819    our neighborhood and around the world        166    00:09:19.819 --> 00:09:22.739    from tutoring at the Harvard ed portal        167    00:09:22.739 --> 00:09:25.739    in Austin to working in Liberia to        168    00:09:25.739 --> 00:09:28.709    mitigate the Ebola crisis they make a        169    00:09:28.709 --> 00:09:30.869    difference in the lives of countless        170    00:09:30.869 --> 00:09:34.889    individuals the Dexter gate across the        171    00:09:34.889 --> 00:09:38.100    yard invites students to enter to grow        172    00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.850    in wisdom depart to serve better by        173    00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:47.069    country and that kind today some 6,500        174    00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:50.819    graduates go forth may each of them        175    00:09:50.819 --> 00:09:55.999    remember that it is in some way to serve        176    00:09:55.999 --> 00:09:58.799    there is yet another danger we should        177    00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:02.639    note as well self-absorption may obscure        178    00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:05.519    not only our responsibilities to others        179    00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:10.259    but our dependence upon them and this is        180    00:10:10.259 --> 00:10:12.689    troubling for Harvard for higher        181    00:10:12.689 --> 00:10:15.869    education and for fundamental social        182    00:10:15.869 --> 00:10:18.749    institutions whose purposes and        183    00:10:18.749 --> 00:10:23.100    necessity we forget at our peril why do        184    00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.410    we even need college critics demand        185    00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.249    can't we do it all on our own        186    00:10:28.249 --> 00:10:31.410    Peter Thiel Silicon Valley entrepreneur        187    00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.559    has urged students to drop out and has        188    00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:36.629    even subsidized them including several        189    00:10:36.629 --> 00:10:39.449    of our undergraduates to leave college        190    00:10:39.449 --> 00:10:41.899    and pursue their individual        191    00:10:41.899 --> 00:10:45.299    entrepreneurial dreams after all the        192    00:10:45.299 --> 00:10:47.429    logic goes Mark Zuckerberg and Bill        193    00:10:47.429 --> 00:10:49.679    Gates dropped out and they seem to have        194    00:10:49.679 --> 00:10:50.270    done        195    00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:55.450    okay well yes but we should remember        196    00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:59.060    Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg had        197    00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.010    Harvard to drop out of        198    00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:14.769    Harvard Harvard to serve as the place        199    00:11:14.769 --> 00:11:16.660    where their world-changing discoveries        200    00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:21.010    were born Harvard and institutions like        201    00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.290    it to train the physicists        202    00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.630    mathematicians computer scientists        203    00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.570    business analysts lawyers and thousands        204    00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.269    of other skilled individuals upon whom        205    00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:35.560    Facebook and Microsoft depend Harvard to        206    00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.480    enlighten public servants to lead a        207    00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.269    country in which Facebook Microsoft and        208    00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:43.510    companies like them can thrive Harvard        209    00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.060    to nurture the writers and filmmakers        210    00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.720    and journalists who create the storied        211    00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.019    content that gives the Internet its        212    00:11:53.019 --> 00:11:56.529    substance and we must recognize as well        213    00:11:56.529 --> 00:11:59.140    that universities have served as sources        214    00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.660    of discoveries essential to the work of        215    00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.209    the companies advancing the revolutions        216    00:12:04.209 --> 00:12:06.610    and technology that have changed our        217    00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:10.149    lives from early successes in creating        218    00:12:10.149 --> 00:12:13.000    and programming computers to development        219    00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.790    of prototypes that lay groundwork for        220    00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.240    the now ubiquitous touchscreen we are        221    00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.970    told to that universities are about to        222    00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.690    be unbundled disrupted by innovations        223    00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.750    that enable individuals to teach        224    00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.079    themselves selecting from a buffet of        225    00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:35.500    massive open online courses and building        226    00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.240    do-it-yourself degrees but online        227    00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.769    opportunities and residential learning        228    00:12:41.769 --> 00:12:45.160    are not at odds the former can        229    00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.040    strengthen but does not supplant the        230    00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.310    latter and through initiatives like EDX        231    00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.110    and Harvard X we are sharing        232    00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.269    intellectual riches that are the        233    00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:57.790    creations of institutions of higher        234    00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.699    learning sharing them with millions of        235    00:13:00.699 --> 00:13:03.000    people around the globe        236    00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.269    intriguingly we have found that a highly        237    00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:09.010    represented group among these online        238    00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.190    learners        239    00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.610    around the world is teachers who will        240    00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.920    use this knowledge to enrich their own        241    00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.780    schools and face-to-face classrooms        242    00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.510    assertions about the irrelevance of        243    00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.640    universities are part of a broader and        244    00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.090    growing mistrust of institutions more        245    00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:33.320    generally one fueled by our intoxication        246    00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.870    with the power and charisma of the        247    00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:39.340    individual and the cult of celebrity        248    00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.830    government business nonprofits are        249    00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.190    joined with universities as targets of        250    00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:50.770    suspicion and criticism there are few        251    00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.890    countervailing voices to remind us how        252    00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:57.410    institutions serve and support us we        253    00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:59.830    tend to take what they do for granted        254    00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:03.860    your food was safe your blood test was        255    00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:07.900    reliable your polling place was open        256    00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.730    electricity was available when you flip        257    00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.970    the switch your flight to Boston took        258    00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.760    off and landed according to rules and        259    00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.790    systems and organizations responsible        260    00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:23.930    for safe air travel just imagine a week        261    00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.060    or a month without this civic        262    00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.390    infrastructure without the institutions        263    00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.020    that undergird our society and without        264    00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.660    the commitment to our interdependence        265    00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.500    that created these structures of        266    00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.900    commonality in the first place        267    00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.130    think of the countries in West Africa        268    00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:45.830    that lacked the public health systems to        269    00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.830    contain Ebola and the devastation that        270    00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.910    resulted contrast that with the network        271    00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.580    of institutions that so rapidly saved        272    00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.370    lives and contain spread of the disease        273    00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.360    when it appeared in the United States        274    00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.610    think about other elements of our civic        275

challenge us to look beyond        290    00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:54.250    the immediate the instantly gratifying        291    00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:57.340    to think about the bigger picture the        292    00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:01.330    longer run the larger home they remind        293    00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.970    us that the world is only temporarily        294    00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:07.870    ours that we are stewards entrusted with        295    00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.840    the past and responsible to the future        296    00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.680    we are larger than ourselves and our        297    00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.480    selfies that responsibility is        298    00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.050    quintessentially the work of        299    00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.350    universities calling upon our shared        300    00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.520    human heritage to invent a new future        301    00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.860

ongoing        304    00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.060    commitment not to a single individual or        305    00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:44.050    even one generation or one era but to a        306    00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:47.470    larger world and to the service of the        307    00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:53.380    age that is waiting before in 1884 my        308    00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.500    predecessor Charles William Elliot        309    00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.860    unveiled a statue of John Harvard and        310    00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:03.100    spoke of the good that can come from the        311    00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.500    study of what we might call the enlarged        312    00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.380    life of the man who's named this        313    00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.850    university bears Eliot said he will        314    00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:15.820    teach that the good which men do lives        315    00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.660    after them fructified and multiplied        316    00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.590    beyond all power of measurement or        317    00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:26.050    computation he will teach that from the        318    00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:29.610    seed which he planted have sprung joy        319    00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.299    strength        320    00:17:31.299 --> 00:17:34.960    and

--> 00:17:50.169    afternoon        326    00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:52.749    is not simply a monument to an        327    00:17:52.749 --> 00:17:56.860    individual but to a community and an

 00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.560    afternoon but I am also a little        25    00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.360    intimidated 41 years ago when I was a        26    00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.080    freshman in hallw worthy over there        27    00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.799    surrounded I know I        28    00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.759    know surrounded by my brilliant new        29    00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.520    classmates I was convinced there would        30    00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.680    come a soft knock at the door one night        31    00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.079    from the dean of admissions with the        32    00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.920    awkward news that my admission had been        33    00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.520    a mistake and that I should quietly        34    00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.680    gather my things        35    00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.439    I often feel that way here in Cambridge        36    00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.560    not just at this August        37    00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.119    institution I've spent the past semester        38    00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.320    as a visiting fellow at The Innovation        39    00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.720    Institute at        40    00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.520    MIT now why while some of my vintage may        41    00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.119    still referred to MIT derisively as that        42    00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.759    vocational school just down river I met        43    00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.479    students there who were already dazzling        44    00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.840    Nobel laurates with their inventions as        45    00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.479    teenagers        46    00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.640    even campaigning for governor was a        47    00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.240    special challenge in Cambridge I can't        48    00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.880    even count the number of times out on        49    00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.479    the trail when I was asked a policy        50    00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.599    question by someone who had already        51    00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.800    written a book on the        52    00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.720    subject I Trac these feelings in part to        53    00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.319    the fact that as a kid Harvard was not        54    00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.640    part of my universe I grew up as Cynthia        55    00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.400    said on welfare on the south side of        56    00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.440    Chicago and was the first in my family        57    00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.959    to go to college when I told my        58    00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.800    grandmother I'd been admitted to Harvard        59    00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.560    she screamed with pride and delight and        60    00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.599    then she paused and asked now where is        61    00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.519    that        62    00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.879    anyway that same grandmother would be        63    00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.560    proud today she would react to the        64    00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.599    feelings I've described having when I'm        65    00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.879    in this rarified community by smiling        66    00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.920    and saying it keeps you        67    00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.120    humble of course a caner bridan would        68    00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.080    more likely Sniff and paraphrase Winston        69    00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.080    Churchill and quip that I have much to        70    00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.760    be humble        71    00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.799    about all of which is to say to you        72    00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.879    graduates in particular today that I        73    00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.519

talking about the kind of unease        89    00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.760    that comes from being a little unsure        90    00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.760    that you already know all you need to        91    00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.319    know the kind of restlessness that        92    00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.439    compels you to look Beyond yourself for        93    00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.239    answers and        94    00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.840    meaning you graduates came to Harvard        95    00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.720    with big ideas and you leave with big        96    00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.159    capacities but still as my grandmother        97    00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.200    would say what you don't know could fill        98    00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.120    a        99    00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.799    book as far as you have journeyed to        100    00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.519    achieve today's Milestone your education        101    00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.320    is in fact        102    00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.800    incomplete think of yourselves instead        103    00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.720    as educated more in the sense that Louie        104    00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.919    Pastor described as learning to listen        105    00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.800    to anything without losing your        106    00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.639    confidence        107    00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.880    or your        108    00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.240    temper because if you are        109    00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.199    listening listening with        110    00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.520    unease you will hear the yearnings of a        111    00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.000    Restless        112    00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.280    world I'm not sure we were listening        113    00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.039    very closely to those yearnings When I        114    00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:52.880    Was An        115    00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.720    undergraduate in the mid 1970s Harvard        116    00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.919    had just settled down from a long season        117    00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.199    of student unrest a few years before        118    00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.440    student protests over the Vietnam War        119    00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.919    had rocked this campus and women moving        120    00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.240    into the formerly all male River houses        121    00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.080    had been a source of widespread        122    00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.800    upset only a few years before that        123    00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.880    grandmothers and school kids preachers        124    00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.400    and sharecroppers had marched over the        125    00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.960    Edmund Pettis bridge in Selma to demand        126    00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.800    access to the ballot in other words on        127    00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.800    the eve of my arrival on this campus        128    00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.199    civil and human rights and indeed issues        129    00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.280    of War and Peace were matters of current        130    00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.880    events by the time I got to campus        131    00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.840    students were comparatively        132    00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.440    complacent because we had missed all the        133    00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.039    fun we occasionally acted out in offbeat        134    00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:47.360    ways in dunster house we got all excite        135    00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.479    exercised over the decision to stop        136    00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:52.880    serving hot breakfast in the dining hall        137    00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.120    Cold Cereal fruit yogurt pastries Juice        138    00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.759    coffee all this would be available every        139    00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:01.479    morning but if we wanted an        140    00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.600    egg we'd have to walk a block to levered        141    00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.080    house        142    00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.840    outrageous so one spring morning we        143    00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.759    marched on        144    00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.599    Leverett complete with banners beating        145    00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.720    drums and scores of fellow students        146    00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.880    never before seen at breakfast        147    00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.080    time we took to the streets over        148    00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.919    pancakes so it's a marvelous Improvement        149    00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:30.639    in my view to see students these days        150    00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.960    take to the streets over issues of real        151    00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.319    consequence in response to the yawning        152    00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:38.120    economic gap between the rich and the        153    00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.960    poor in this country workers and        154    00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.400    students and many others set up tent        155    00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.880    caps tent camps on Wall Street and the        156    00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.000    Occupy Movement quickly spread to many        157    00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.680    other cities including        158    00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.880    Boston the killings of unarmed black men        159    00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.919    by unaccountable police officers in        160    00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:57.440    Ferguson Missouri and Staten Island New        161    00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.759    York moved young people and and many        162    00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:01.319    others to take to the streets to        163    00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:03.680    Proclaim black lives        164    00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.680    matter the failure of national policy        165    00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.919    makers and citizens alike to reverse        166    00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:12.000    climate change compel students faculty        167    00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.080    and alumni on this campus and others to        168    00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.919    ignite a new divestment        169    00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:19.919    movement        170    00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.919    predictably predictably each of these        171    00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:25.599    actions has been        172    00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:27.840    criticized the Occupy Movement is        173    00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.680    faulted for having no agenda Beyond        174    00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.919    discontent for having called attention        175    00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:34.840    to the critical truth that social        176    00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.479    Mobility a central feature of the        177    00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:40.599    American idea is disappearing without        178    00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:41.840    offering a        179    00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.199    solution the Marchers under the banner        180    00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:46.759    of black lives matter matter are faulted        181    00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:49.360    for similar shortcomings for trying to        182    00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.479    shut down highway traffic instead of        183    00:07:51.479 --> 00:07:54.560    proposing specific programs and policies        184    00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.039    to help us heal the devastating lack of        185    00:07:58.039 --> 00:08:00.199    understanding between police and young        186    00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:01.080    black        187    00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.080    men climate change activists are faulted        188    00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.800    for putting symbols above substance by        189    00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.879    demanding divestment in fossil fuel        190    00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:11.400    companies when this is widely believed        191    00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.960    to be unlikely to affect anybody's        192    00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.639    actual        193    00:08:15.639 --> 00:08:18.400    Behavior I share some of those        194    00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.400    concerns but I am also grateful that        195    00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.360    students today are putting far more        196    00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.360    important issues on the table than hot        197    00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.919    breakfast indeed I welcome welome the        198    00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:32.399    engagement of today's generation of        199    00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:34.200    activists and the heightened        200    00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.000    Consciousness they have demanded of the        201    00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.560    rest of us and I am hopeful that those        202    00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.320    in power will make more of the profound        203    00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.480    ends they seek than of the imperfect        204    00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.279    means of their        205    00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:49.600    protest don't get me        206    00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.000    wrong I hate M        207    00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.120    Behavior I hate violence of any kind I        208    00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.800    don't want unrest in the streets        209    00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.760    but I do want unrest in our hearts and        210    00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.279    Minds I do want us all to be uneasy        211    00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:08.560    about the Grim realities of black men        212    00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.399    and families and the widespread        213    00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:13.360    nonchalant about        214    00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.720    poverty I want us to be uneasy about The        215    00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.920    Chronic desperation of communities some        216    00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.600    of us are just one generation away from        217    00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.880    living in about the way we dehumanize        218    00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.720    the fellow Souls we call alien about the        219    00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.560    careless with which we treat the planet        220    00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.680    itself I want us to ask ourselves hard        221    00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.240    questions and to ask our leaders hard        222    00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.760    questions about the state of the        223    00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.920    American dream why the poor are stuck in        224    00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.519    poverty and why the middle class are        225    00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:47.760    just one paycheck away from being poor        226    00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.880    and I want us all to be a little        227    00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.640    uncomfortable about few about how few of        228    00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.600    our Comforts we        229    00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.120    share I want us to be uneasy because if        230    00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.279    if enough of us are uneasy we might        231    00:10:02.279 --> 00:10:05.279    begin to feel some urgency about finding        232    00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:08.560    the solutions to the things that make us        233    00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.000    so I honor the work that many        234    00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.480    philanthropies and government programs        235    00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.720    and indivi individual Saints do to show        236    00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.680    compassion and kindness to others as        237    00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.800    Governor I saw up close the Practical        238    00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.600    impact that affordable housing or        239    00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.560    sentencing reform or a great teacher has        240    00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.519    on an individual on a family or on a        241    00:10:30.519 --> 00:10:33.560    neighborhood and if policy most matters        242    00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.600    most where it touches people maybe it's        243    00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.639    the point of individual contact that we        244    00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:40.360    should celebrate        245    00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.200    most but somehow to settle for only that        246    00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.200    is to make peace with large scale        247    00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.279    suffering to accept the way things are        248    00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:54.839    as the way they ought to be and to me        249    00:10:54.839 --> 00:10:58.040    that seems fundamentally        250    00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.600    unamerican        251    00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.279    this is the only nation in human history        252    00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:07.120    organized around a set of Civic        253    00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.200    aspirations not religion or language or        254    00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.440    geography or even a common culture none        255    00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.279    of the things that normally organize a        256    00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:19.079    nation but instead a handful of        257    00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:21.040    transcendent Civic        258    00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.279    ideals and we have defined those values        259    00:11:24.279 --> 00:11:26.440    over time and through struggle is        260    00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:31.079    freedom equality opport unity and fair        261    00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:34.000    play these are the ties that bind us        262    00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.079    across time and all sorts of mostly        263    00:11:37.079 --> 00:11:39.040    superficial differences and that have        264    00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.760    made America the Envy of the world as        265    00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.040    one great Israeli Statesman puts it        266    00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.320    America is the only superpower whose        267    00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.000    power comes from giving not from        268    00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.760    taking indeed our greatest gift to this        269    00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.200    poor black kid from Chicago and to        270    00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.240    Strivers of every type and mankind for        271    00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.360    Generations is a reason to Hope in fits        272    00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.240    and starts through our history those        273    00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.320    values have compelled us to reach higher        274    00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.360    to do big        275    00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.120    things and I worry that as a nation we        276    00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.160    are forgetting        277    00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.760    how over 16 million of our neighbors and        278    00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.120    family members who once couldn't can now        279    00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.399    afford to see a doctor thanks to the        280    00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:27.880    president's Healthcare        281    00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.639    reforms        282    00:12:29.639 --> 00:12:31.920    and        283    00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.079    yet and yet we focus on the embarrassing        284    00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:40.279    fact that at the outset the website        285    00:12:40.279 --> 00:12:42.800    didn't work as if that discredits the        286    00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.079    objective        287    00:12:44.079 --> 00:12:48.160    itself our roads rails and bridges are        288    00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.560    in a state of dangerous disrepair        289    00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.639    needing years of focused work and the        290    00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:56.800    best our Congress can muster is funding        291    00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.600    for two months before they leave on        292    00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.760    vacation        293    00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.279    vacation when President fa called to        294    00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:05.519    invite me to address you this morning or        295    00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:08.440    afternoon she reminded me that from this        296    00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.120    very Podium General George C Marshall        297    00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.720    announced the Marshall Plan to rebuild        298    00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.360    Europe after World War        299    00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.160    Two I wonder what reaction General        300    00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.199    Marshall's idea would elicit        301    00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:24.519    today a collective groan a wistful        302    00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:27.399    sigh and yet Across America and across        303    00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:31.440    the globe big IDE ideas are exactly what        304    00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.360    the world        305    00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.000    craves the graduates of this University        306    00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.480    are trained to think big will you be        307    00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.519    uneasy enough to act        308    00:13:42.519 --> 00:13:46.959    big what will you do with what you        309    00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:50.920    know you know that the answer to Chronic        310    00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.600    poverty is opportunity that opportunity        311    00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.600    comes from an economy that grows out to        312    00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.920    the marginalized not not just up to the        313    00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.360    well-connected        314    00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.330    [Applause]        315    00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:10.800    and you know that economic growth of        316    00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.720    this kind requires a massive        317    00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.040    reinvestment of ideas and money by        318    00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.720    industry and by government in schools in        319    00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.759    infrastructure and in The Innovation        320    00:14:22.759 --> 00:14:26.079    industries that are fueling the        321    00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.399    future you know        322    00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:32.639    that community policing where police are        323    00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:35.360    of and in the communities they serve is        324    00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.279    a strategy that makes us        325    00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:41.040    safer and you also know that whatever        326    00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.880    methods we pursue for better policing        327    00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.360    race and racism is still too close to        328    00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.360    the surface of everything from Commerce        329    00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.880    to the Twitter commentary about whom        330    00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.880    celebrities date you know that what's        331    00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.440    happening in Ferguson or Baltimore more        332    00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.480    is but The Fray edge of a neglect that        333    00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.320    is undermining our country and that        334    00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.680    declaring ourselves officially race        335    00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.560    blind or postracial as a way to end        336

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.079    [Applause]        340    00:15:21.079 --> 00:15:24.720    know you know that climate change is too        341    00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.680    serious a threat to human survival to        342    00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.680    tolerate anything less than an orderly        343    00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.079    and purposeful shift to a carbon limited        344    00:15:35.079 --> 00:15:40.160    if not carbon free economy and you also        345    00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.040    know you also know that that requires a        346    00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.120    plan with all players yes including big        347    00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.600    oil and coal at the table and that the        348    00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.880    way to move us all together is to seize        349    00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.360    the countless opportunities to to create        350    00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.319    wealth and jobs which such a transition        351    00:16:00.319 --> 00:16:02.160    has and will        352    00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.800    present        353    00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.720    poverty        354

own        357    00:16:16.639 --> 00:16:20.040    making and surely therefore cannot be        358    00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.720    beyond our capacity to care about and to        359    00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.199    solve we have leaders here in this        360    00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:29.560    graduating class ready to chart a course        361    00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.880    to that Higher        362    00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.600    Ground ready to listen for the needs and        363    00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.759    the answers that arising from community

can        369    00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.120    get outside your own Ambitions and think        370    00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.480    about the worlds we need uneasy leaders        371    00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.440    who won't let your ideals be casual        372    00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.839    casualties of your confrontations with        373    00:17:00.839 --> 00:17:04.640    reality who refuse as Dr King said to        374    00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.520    accept despair as the final response to        375    00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.559    the ambiguities of        376    00:17:09.559 --> 00:17:13.039    History we need uneasy leaders straining        377    00:17:13.039 --> 00:17:15.799    to hear the yearnings of the powerless        378    00:17:15.799 --> 00:17:18.799    as clearly as we do the expectations of        379    00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:23.039    the powerful and willing to think and to        380    00:17:23.039 --> 00:17:26.039    act        381    00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.080    big I'm especially proud PR of the        382    00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.200    performance of Massachusetts students        383    00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.960    during my tenure as        384    00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.240    Governor I'm proud of the fact that not        385    00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.919    only did we fund the schools at record        386    00:17:37.919 --> 00:17:40.200    highs in each of the years I served even        387    00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.679    during the global economic collapse but        388    00:17:42.679 --> 00:17:44.960    our students ranked first in the nation        389    00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.880    in student achievement each year and at        390    00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:52.720    or near the top in the world in math and        391    00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.520    science        392    00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.919    and yet for nearly two        393    00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:04.799    decades that we've been on our education        394    00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:07.120    reform Journey here in massachusett        395    00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.720    achievement gaps        396    00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.280    persisted and the kids stuck in those        397    00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.840    gaps are poor or kids with special needs        398    00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.919    or kids who speak English as a second        399    00:18:17.919 --> 00:18:19.799    language of course to have an        400    00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:22.799    achievement Gap at all is an educational        401    00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:26.039    and an economic challenge but to let it        402    00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:29.720    language languish for for as long as we        403    00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.799    had was to my mind a moral question cuz        404    00:18:33.799 --> 00:18:35.440    those are our children        405    00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.640    too and that made us        406    00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.960    uneasy so we set to work on a big        407    00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.559    reform and we faced all the predicable        408    00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:46.080    hurdles and        409    00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.919    naysayers the charter Advocates had one        410    00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:51.280    certain answer the teachers union had        411    00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.120    another the business Community had yet        412    00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.799    another parents and suburbs had one set        413    00:18:56.799 --> 00:18:58.679    of Demands not always cons assistent        414    00:18:58.679 --> 00:19:01.840    with parents and cities and so on and so        415    00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.840    on in the end we put the children first        416    00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.799    we acknowledge that all children can        417    00:19:07.799 --> 00:19:10.320    learn and that all have their own ways        418    00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.799    of doing so and ultimately we crafted a        419    00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:15.840    piece of legislation that provided new        420    00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.080    rules and tools to meet children where        421    00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.440    they are it was a Triumph of every        422    00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.880    interest group for the common interest        423    00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.679    and slowly but        424    00:19:26.679 --> 00:19:28.840    demonstrably we are close closing        425    00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.039    achievement gaps in        426    00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:33.919    Massachusetts what was the big        427    00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:37.120    idea that no child's Destiny should be        428    00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.039    defined by her zip code of        429    00:19:40.039 --> 00:19:42.679    birth I visited a school in Boston that        430    00:19:42.679 --> 00:19:45.559    was using all of these new tools on        431    00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:47.640    every measure in just a few years that        432    00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.600    school had lifted itself from one of the        433    00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.320    worst in the city to one of the best in        434    00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.039    the state it students were proud of        435    00:19:54.039 --> 00:19:55.720    their achievements and purposeful about        436    00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.320    their future you could see it not just        437    00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.280    in their test scores but in their eyes        438    00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.880    their posture their        439    00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.360    attitudes they have not yet overcome        440    00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.440    their        441    00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.640    poverty they have steep hills yet to        442    00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.400    climb but they will climb them because        443    00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.880    now they have a reason to Hope and they        444    00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:18.320    are making the very best of it they and        445    00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.720    children like them everywhere are the        446    00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.840    reason the idealism of you graduates        447    00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.400    matters I'm not asking you to live in a        448    00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.960    world of

--> 00:20:37.320    change you have to gain influence and        452    00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.080    use power to develop policy and        453    00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.960    Implement action plans to be accountable        454    00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.360    you have to        455    00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:48.760    organize but ideals let us imagine Big        456    00:20:48.760 -->

  00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.920    because of his time here        67    00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.950    so we are here to award our graduating        68    00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.840    students their diplomas which we will do        69    00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.930    shortly but first I am required to give        70    00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.480    a speech and you are required to applaud        71    00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.250    politely at various points during my        72    00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.430    remarks a few friendly whoops along the        73    00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.750    way would be welcomed as well so last        74    00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.790    year I gave a speech about time with a        75    00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.800    few words about kindness and courage and        76    00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.890    my wife Katie who was here listened to        77    00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.270    the speech and I asked her afterwards        78    00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.530    what she thought of it she said oh I        79    00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.360    thought it was pretty good but I also        80    00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.210    thought it was a little preachy the        81    00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.580    preachy comments stuck with me which is        82    00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.250    why this year I've decided to talk about        83    00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.740    sin in particular I'd like to talk about        84    00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.810    the sin of omission and the basic idea        85    00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.880    that you should be paying attention to        86    00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.670    what you are not doing rather than make        87    00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.130    this speech less preachy than last year        88    00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.050    I thought I'd go all in and give a        89    00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.720    full-blown sermon now before you get        90    00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.610    nervous I should note that I intend to        91    00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.620    talk about the sin of omission not from        92    00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.750    a religious perspective but to use it as        93    00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.420    a metaphor for ethical behavior and an        94    00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.340    approach to life this will be a secular        95    00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.950    sermon not a religious one and I want to        96    00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.390    talk to you about the sin of omission as        97    00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.430    it relates to professional lives your        98    00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.410    personal lives and more broadly to        99    00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.170    education itself but before we get me        100    00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.280    deep in sin let me take a moment to        101    00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.260    reassure you about the careers ahead of        102    00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.390    you here's the most important point I        103    00:05:22.390 -->

00:05:51.200    promise of diversity and you've engaged        111    00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.660    with the world beyond Appian Way during        112    00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.910    an

music by way of background the        142    00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.370    basic idea behind the sin of omission        143    00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.320    whether as featured in religious        144    00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.229    traditions or in its secular        145    00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:09.940    metaphorical form is that just as it is        146    00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.430    wrong to do intentional harm it is also        147    00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.729    sometimes wrong to do nothing that is it        148    00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:17.800    can be wrong to fail to act or speak        149    00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.560    thus in itself is recognized as such in        150    00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.000    a number of religions including        151    00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.300    Christianity Judaism and Islam though it        152    00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.370    is not a pantheistic concept just like        153    00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.440    the concept of sin is not universal        154    00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.810    among all religions I offer these        155    00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.120    observations I should add not as an        156    00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.830    expert on world religions but as a        157    00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.820    pretty good Googler I can tell you from        158    00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.800    personal authority however that the sin        159    00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.930    of omission is a fairly big deal in the        160    00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:45.790    Catholic Church which was the faith in        161    00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.220    which I was raised Catholicism as you        162    00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.930    may know has a detailed almost        163    00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.270    legalistic accounting of sin including        164    00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.459    the sin of omission I have been        165    00:08:54.459 --> 00:08:57.250    fascinated by this particular sin since        166    00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.320    I first learned about it in eighth grade        167    00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.510    during appropriately enough my first        168    00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.959    confession I vividly remember standing        169    00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:06.940    in line with my fellow adolescent        170    00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.839    penitence mulling over what I might        171    00:09:09.839 --> 00:09:12.370    confess to the Catholic priest when I        172    00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.640    spotted my friend Greg Iannuzzi this was        173    00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.350    significant because a few years earlier        174    00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:20.079    Greg and I had basically set my backyard        175    00:09:20.079 --> 00:09:22.829    on fire        176    00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.589    we started innocently enough by trying        177    00:09:26.589 --> 00:09:28.029    to light a leaf on fire with a        178    00:09:28.029 --> 00:09:30.610    magnifying glass when that didn't work        179    00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.630    we decided to pour gasoline on the leaf        180    00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.630    turns out that worked really well to the        181    00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.399    kids in the audience please don't try        182    00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:41.800    this at home or anywhere else for that        183    00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.050    matter in any event before Greg and I        184    00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.029    knew it there was a big blaze in my        185    00:09:46.029 --> 00:09:47.950    backyard which we finally managed to put        186    00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.649    out with a hose and some buckets of sand        187    00:09:50.649 --> 00:09:52.870    but not before my eyebrows were singed        188    00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.690    off and a size of a black mark was left        189    00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.600    in my yard my father asked me that night        190    00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.810    if I knew what had happened it was more        191    00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.560    of a rhetorical question really because        192    00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.709    there was no great mystery nonetheless I        193    00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:10.500    denied knowing anything about it        194    00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.700    despite in pointing out that he was        195    00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.170    pretty sure I had started the day with        196    00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.980    eyebrows        197    00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.399    so there I am yours later standing in        198    00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:26.250    line with my firefighting friend Greg we        199    00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.779    looked at each other just before was        200    00:10:27.779 --> 00:10:29.310    going to the confessional and we knew        201    00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.649    exactly what was on the other's mind you        202    00:10:31.649 --> 00:10:34.470    going to tell he asked not sure I        203    00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.290    replied so I went in I confessed to a        204    00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:42.000    few minor sins throwaways really and        205    00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.860    then I asked a priest what happens if        206    00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.020    you confess to some sins but not all of        207    00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.550    them I just wanted to know my options he        208    00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.350    said that that in itself could be a sin        209    00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.680    a sin of omission damn I remember        210    00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.940    thinking but not saying obviously as the        211    00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.950    priest explained that failing to act or        212    00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.690    in this case confess when we know we        213    00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.370    should is not much different than doing        214    00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.560    an intentionally bad act I pictured an        215    00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.779    endless loop of sin piled on sin and        216    00:11:09.779 --> 00:11:11.790    confessed on the spot both to setting        217    00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.279    the blaze and as they say in DC to miss        218    00:11:14.279 --> 00:11:17.430    remembering that fact when questioned by        219    00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.980    my father nonetheless I remain somewhat        220    00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.290    puzzled by the equation of acts and        221    00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.110    omissions as I grew older I came to        222    00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.060    appreciate that failing to act is often        223    00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.680    a choice and that we rightfully bear        224    00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.810    responsibility for our choices the        225    00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.360    choice not to act I realized after a        226    00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.910    helpful class in college on postmodern        227    00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.610    thought is itself an act and like most        228    00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.010    people I came to recognize the secular        229    00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.839    version of a sin of omission and        230    00:11:42.839 --> 00:11:45.240    understand that sometimes failing to act        231    00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.430    just is failing to act as justice blames        232    00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:49.410    of blameworthy as acting badly I        233    00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.330    personally thought at this point I was        234    00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:52.830    coming along nicely on the moral        235    00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.930    development front and then I went to law        236    00:11:54.930 --> 00:12:00.110    school and there I met the drowning baby        237    00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.520    the drowning baby is a well-worn        238    00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.650    hypothetical used by first-year law        239    00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.420    professors to introduce the legal        240    00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.550    concept of duty the fictional story is        241    00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:09.089    simple        242    00:12:09.089 --> 00:12:11.279    a man interestingly it's always a man        243    00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:13.829    walks down a street and sees a baby face        244    00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:16.110    down in a puddle oddly no one else is        245    00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.850    around and the man could easily turn the        246    00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.160    baby over to prevent drowning without        247    00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.110    any risk to himself he doesn't the        248    00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.510    question is this has he violated any law        249    00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.670    civil or criminal the answer which        250    00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.980    first-year law students are surprised to        251    00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.100    learn is no the reason is that under the        252    00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.779    law we generally don't owe and affirm        253    00:12:33.779 --> 00:12:36.209    of duty to strangers we have to avoid        254    00:12:36.209 --> 00:12:38.009    hurting others but we have no legal        255    00:12:38.009 --> 00:12:40.170    obligation to help them regardless of        256    00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:43.350    how easy it might be to do so now if        257    00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.540    you're thinking right now you're glad        258    00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.839    you didn't go to law school because it        259    00:12:48.839 --> 00:12:50.579    might forever cloud your sense of right        260    00:12:50.579 --> 00:12:52.649    and wrong and I'm with you        261    00:12:52.649 --> 00:13:03.720    I think why I'm here I think the law        262    00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.089    contains too cramped a notion of our        263    00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:08.189    obligations to others and I prefer the        264    00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:10.410    more robust concept embodied in the sin        265    00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:12.660    of omission which I would translate into        266    00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.790    these plain secular and very simple        267    00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.589    terms if you have the power to help        268    00:13:16.589 --> 00:13:18.959    someone if you have the ability to right        269    00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:22.620    or wrong if you have the opportunity to        270    00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.870    make your voices heard you should        271    00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.029    rightfully feel bad when you fail to do        272    00:13:27.029 --> 00:13:28.980    so not only should you feel bad I        273    00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.230    predict you will feel bad and from here        274    00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.240    on out that's all I mean by the sin of        275    00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.279    omission so how does this sin relate to        276    00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:36.720    you and your professional careers and        277    00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.379    personalize well here is the Sermon part        278    00:13:39.379 --> 00:13:42.120    you are leaving a world where most of        279    00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.000    your obligations have been externally        280    00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.970    imposed and fairly clear and where your        281    00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.339    performance has literally been graded        282    00:13:50.339 --> 00:13:52.319    you will be entering a world where        283    00:13:52.319 --> 00:13:53.850    obligations are going to be less clear        284    00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:56.100    grades non-existent and external        285    00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.750    indicators of performance sometimes        286    00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.180    opaque this is not to say there will be        287    00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.459    no external markers of success or        288    00:14:02.459 --> 00:14:04.050    indicators of achievement there will be        289    00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.680    and I guarantee you will exceed them        290    00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.870    because of your enormous talents and        291    00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.699    because of the drive that has led you to        292    00:14:11.699 --> 00:14:14.490    succeed in the past like I said you are        293    00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.679    going to rock you will be told time and        294    00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:18.689    again that you are doing great work and        295    00:14:18.689 --> 00:14:20.519    you should take pride in that you should        296    00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:22.559    also give thanks perhaps even financial        297    00:14:22.559 --> 00:14:24.089    thanks to the institutions that helped        298    00:14:24.089 --> 00:14:26.390    you along the way        299    00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:29.010    but in addition to taking pride in your        300    00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.080    work you should always ask yourself if        301    00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.210    you could be doing more and buy more I        302    00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:35.160    mean doing more to help others it's        303    00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.460    precisely because you are so talented        304    00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.690    but you should never be completely        305    00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.000    satisfied until you have satisfied        306    00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.370    yourself that you have done all you        307    00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.770    could you will be known by others I        308    00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.930    predict chiefly by what you've done but        309    00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.090    you will know yourself just as well by        310    00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.340    what you haven't done and if you seek to        311    00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.140    be content in this life you need to be        312    00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.210    content with what you haven't done and        313    00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.400    for that to happen you need to set your        314    00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.980    own internal expectations and do things        315    00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.870    that you know are right even when no one        316    00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.480    would blame you for failing to act this        317    00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.400    is just as important in your personal        318    00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.470    life as it is in your professional life        319    00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.020    there will be chances large and small to        320    00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.570    help others who are closest to you even        321    00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.180    when you aren't expected to do so no one        322    00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.730    would blame you for example if you can't        323    00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.920    make it to your child's presentation in        324    00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.960    an elementary school class because it's        325    00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.490    during the middle of the day and you        326    00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.590    have to work but if you can figure out a        327    00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.110    way to be there you should go because        328    00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:33.140    you know it's the right thing to do        329    00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:38.000    these opportunities will not always be        330    00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.360    my daughter asked me to include that        331    00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.090    line these opportunities won't always be        332    00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:49.500    staring you in the face they will        333    00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.360    sometimes be more like tugs at your        334    00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.850    sleeve that are easy to ignore if you        335    00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:55.410    haven't read the book zen and the art of        336    00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:57.030    motorcycle maintenance yet you should        337    00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.590    this is a perfect time than your lives        338    00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.170    to read it I think in it the author        339    00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.510    Robert persik talks about facts that tug        340    00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.310    at our sleeves hoping to be recognized        341    00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.920    because if they were you'd be able to        342    00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.780    solve the problem that you are puzzling        343    00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.250    over or see the world in a different        344    00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:14.100    light I think of that image often and        345    00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.630    believe that opportunities to help        346    00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.520    others to right wrongs and to speak up        347    00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.730    often appear not as obvious demands but        348    00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.370    instead as tugs at your sleeve and let        349    00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.740    me suggest that you pay attention to        350    00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.800    those tugs I'm also suggesting that you        351    00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.570    do things that you know are right even        352    00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:33.540    when you won't get any credit or thanks        353    00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.240    the immortal John Wooden Hall of Fame        354    00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.460    coach for the UCLA men's basketball team        355    00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.770    is credited with saying the character is        356    00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.360    what you do when no one is looking        357    00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.940    I believe Will Rogers and Einstein are        358    00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.170    also credited with saying this but        359    00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:49.110    that's not the point the point is that        360    00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:50.550    you should do the right thing even when        361    00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:52.320    no one will notice when I was a kid my        362    00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.060    father used to say when I had left some        363    00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:57.180    tasks undone and protested that it        364    00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.430    wasn't my job or no one had asked me to        365    00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.620    do it which happened incredibly rarely        366    00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.740    but still he'd say you should see what        367    00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.020    needs doing and do it without being told        368    00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:12.540    I found this intensely annoying when I        369    00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.180    was younger but I've come to think it's        370    00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.950    actually a profound statement about how        371    00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.010    to approach life see what needs doing        372    00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.630    and do it without being told do it in        373    00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.790    other words even if it's not your job        374    00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.160    and even if you will get no notice or        375    00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.980    credit finally you should also learn if        376    00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.690    you haven't already to speak up when you        377    00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.360    have something to say even when no one        378    00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.580    would expect you to speak or blame you        379    00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.920    for remaining quiet it may be at work        380    00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.290    when you have to have an uncomfortable        381    00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.400    conversation with a colleague or a        382    00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.830    student that can easily be avoided it        383    00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.510    may be at home with your partner or        384    00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.820    spouse or children it may be at a school        385    00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.650    board meeting or it may be in the halls        386    00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.630    of Congress when you have the chance to        387    00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:52.910    speak out against        388    00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:55.400    injustice if you are hesitating about        389    00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.830    whether to say anything remember Martin        390    00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:59.540    Luther King's observation that in the        391    00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.150    end we will remember not the words of        392    00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.130    our enemies but the silence of our        393    00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:07.070    friends as a quote from dr. King        394    00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:09.680    suggests sins of omission can be the        395    00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.270    source of some of our deepest regrets        396    00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.580    and I know this from personal experience        397    00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.680    this is a difficult story to tell but I        398    00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.600    want to share it with you in the hope it        399    00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.570    will serve as a cautionary tale my        400    00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:22.370    mother fell and broke her hip in August        401    00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.820    of 2009 she was relatively young 71 but        402    00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.490    had a number of health problems that        403    00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:29.830    made her somewhat frail and vulnerable        404    00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.750    she suffered from one complication after        405    00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.720    another over a torturous five-week        406    00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.280    period and there were a few times when I        407    00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.140    thought she wasn't receiving the care        408    00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.450    she needed but for a number of reasons I        409    00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.940    didn't push the doctors to do more and I        410    00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:45.920    didn't look for ways to get her to a        411    00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.020    different hospital or a different set of        412    00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.720    doctors five weeks after she fell while        413    00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.740    still in the hospital        414    00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.990    she suffered a series of strokes and        415    00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.960    died while I held her hand everyone        416    00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.000    around me said the doctors had dot doing        417    00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.430    more and maybe the result would have        418    00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:03.170    been the same but that's just the point        419    00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:06.340    when it comes to the sin of omission        420    00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.260    you'll never know if the outcome would        421    00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.240    have changed if you had acted and that's        422    00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.820    a haunting weight to bear like a stone        423    00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.860    around your neck that makes it just a        424    00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.990    bit harder to lift your head each day to        425    00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.650    see the light of the Sun so that's a bit        426    00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.440    of a downer I realize but here's the        427    00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.350    good news I promise that every time you        428    00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.510    choose to lend a hand or to right or        429    00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.160    wrong or to speak up you will feel        430    00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.810    better about the world and about        431    00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:35.300    yourself to be sure when you act you may        432    00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.950    make a mistake when you speak you may        433    00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.900    say the wrong thing but it's much better        434    00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.360    to fail while daring greatly than to be        435    00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.730    a bystander to borrow line from Teddy        436    00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:47.870    Roosevelt if you fail while trying often        437    00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:49.220    the worst thing that can happen is that        438    00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.780    you'll have a funny story to tell        439    00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.760    someday it may take a few years before        440    00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.210    it becomes funny but still I can't        441    00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:57.980    recall a single funny story about a        442    00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.650    failure to try now you might be thinking        443    00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:02.330    I'm describing an approach to life        444    00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.070    that's bound to make you feel unworthy        445    00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.900    or at least unfulfilled as there were        446    00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:06.350    Olli        447    00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.990    be more you could do to help one more        448    00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:12.200    student to assist another teacher to        449    00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.059    coach another family to counsel another        450    00:20:14.059 --> 00:20:16.220    school board meeting to attend not to        451    00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.470    mention the enduring issues like poverty        452    00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:21.230    racial injustice educational inequality        453    00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.480    warfare and discrimination but I        454    00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.039    actually think taking the sting of a        455    00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:26.480    mission seriously will bring you a        456    00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.760    certain amount of peace most if not all        457    00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.100    of us are fallen to continuous in        458    00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.100    metaphor just a bit we all take breaks        459    00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.390    we all indulge in one form of frivolous        460    00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:40.280    pleasurable activity or another and we        461    00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.320    all choose which of the unfortunately        462    00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.530    large number of in Justices that exist        463    00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:47.570    in the world we will choose to address        464    00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:50.000    even though we might have the capacity        465    00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.150    to address others it's hard not to be        466    00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.400    humble when you reach this level of        467    00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.919    self-awareness if you recognize that you        468    00:20:57.919 --> 00:20:59.590    are always going to fall a little short        469    00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:02.030    when it comes to writing wrongs or        470    00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:04.610    helping those around you my guess is        471    00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.559    that you are going to be inclined to be        472    00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:09.559    a bit more forgiving of others and I        473    00:21:09.559 --> 00:21:10.730    promise that we'll bring you some        474    00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:12.620    measure of peace with the world around        475    00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.289    you as you focus less on what others        476    00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:18.200    could or should be doing which is often        477    00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.559    frustratingly beyond your control and        478    00:21:20.559 --> 00:21:23.510    focus more on how you can help which is        479    00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:27.620    almost always within your power so all        480    00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.059    well and good you might be thinking but        481    00:21:29.059 --> 00:21:31.280    what does this have to do with education        482    00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.659    good question        483    00:21:32.659 --> 00:21:34.580    then here's my answer in the conclusion        484    00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:38.630    of my talk as a society we tend to focus        485    00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.150    so much attention on bad acts that we        486    00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:43.400    lose sight of what led to those acts in        487    00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.130    the first place possible sins of        488    00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:48.830    commission blind us to the preceding        489    00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:53.450    sins of omission - see what I mean just        490    00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:55.280    think of the numerous tragedies this        491    00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.140    year involving police shootings of        492    00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.419    unarmed African African American men in        493    00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:02.330    places like Ferguson Cleveland Staten        494    00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:04.220    Island in South Carolina as well as the        495    00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.500    death of Freddie gray in Baltimore at        496    00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.380    the hands of police there we focus a lot        497    00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.940    of attention on the shootings and        498    00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.700    killings and the reaction by those who        499    00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.530    protested sometimes violently afterward        500    00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:19.910    but much less attention was        501    00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:22.700    to all the things we didn't do up to        502    00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.620    that point that might have averted these        503    00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.770    tragedies and one of the biggest things        504    00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:31.250    we haven't done in this country yet is        505    00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.800    educate enough of our kids in a way that        506    00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.510    enables them as adults to see        507    00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.030    similarities rather than differences        508    00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:41.390    across lines of race and class that's a        509    00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:44.530    pretty big sin of a mission        510    00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.610    more generally I would say that our        511    00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.620    single single biggle biggest national        512    00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.650    sin of omission is our continued failure        513    00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.710    to provide our most vulnerable children        514    00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:05.050    often poor and students of color truly        515    00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:09.000    equal educational opportunities        516    00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.530    the central problem of education is not        517    00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.510    so much what we are doing but what we        518    00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:23.270    have failed to do in ignoring our        519    00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:25.130    obligations to those who are least        520    00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:28.400    advantage in ignoring the children who        521    00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.280    are drowning in puddles all around us we        522    00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.400    have as a nation committed an enormous        523    00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.480    century-long sin of omission and my        524    00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.940    guess is that deep down this is why you        525    00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.220    came to HGSE in the first place        526    00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.799    even if you've never heard of the sin of        527    00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:48.020    omission you understand that our        528    00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.480    collective aim as educators is not        529    00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.840    simply to atone for that sin but to        530    00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.809    prevent it from happening in the future        531    00:23:55.809 --> 00:23:58.490    that's what it means to change the world        532    00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:01.520    and my final charge to you is to get        533    00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.789    busy on that task and to never settle so        534    00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:06.830    pay attention to that tug at your sleeve        535    00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:11.870    lend a hand right wrongs speak up and as        536    00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.600    you leave Appian Way today see what        537    00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.030    needs doing and do it without being told        538    00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:19.690    thank you

trauma        39    00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.950    during their early lives as they escaped        40    00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.319    continental Europe ahead of a Holocaust        41    00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.050    his father Ralph was 16 when he fled        42    00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.960    Belgium in 1940 his mother Marion fled        43    00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.440    Poland at the age of 10 and when millaa        44    00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.260    millaa ban took his job at the        45    00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.060    International Rescue Committee which

refugees he says he feels        51    00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.600    compelled to repay his debt to society        52    00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.240    for the privileges he enjoyed he        53    00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.730    quoted as saying my generation is a        54    00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.070    transitional generation because we met        55    00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.840    people who survived the Holocaust and        56    00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.480    who have a responsibility to pass on        57    00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.600    what happened to a new generation family        58    00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.430    has indeed always been important to him        59    00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.280    he tells tells people his proudest        60    00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.960    achievements since moving to the US is        61    00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.270    that when not traveling or needed on a        62    00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.880    television morning television show he        63    00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.770    walks his two sons the 1 and a quarter        64    00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.190    miles to their primary school home from        65    00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.960    their families home even through this        66    00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.080    recent frigid winter I am actually quite        67    00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.940    curious to know was it really is this        68    00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.770    just like talk or did you actually walk        69    00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.140

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:50.160    melt after working with the center-left        127    00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.729    think-tank        128    00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.289    he worked his way up

 00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.850    in 1989 from MIT as interestingly enough        132    00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.030    a Kennedy scholar he has visited the        133    00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.680    Kennet the Kennedy School in recent        134    00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.320    years has taught he was a named he was        135    00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.300    named a Fisher family fellow and has        136    00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.220    taught in connection with our future of        137    00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.669    diplomacy project now at the IRC he has        138    00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:16.500    an organization that together with its        139    00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.110    partners helps victims of war diseases        140    00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.479    including Ebola and persecution around        141    00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:22.889    the globe and here in the United States        142    00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:26.400    as one example they have been one of the        143    00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.200    largest providers of aid in South Sudan        144    00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.260    since 1989 and during the current crisis        145    00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.830    the IRC has provided 800,000 people with        146    00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.500    health care water sanitation and the        147    00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.060    like whether it's the Congo or Syria        148    00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.560    wherever there's a crisis around the        149    00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.900    world and people in conflict need help        150    00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.840    the IRC has been in the lead indeed in        151    00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.900    2014 alone they helped seventeen point        152    00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.240    six million people who lives lies and        153    00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.520    Lad livelihoods were shattered by        154    00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.060    conflict it is my very great honor to        155    00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.740    welcome to the Kennedy School today's        156    00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.000    commencement speaker the right        157    00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.320    honourable David Miliband        158    00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.800    thank you very much Dean Elwood and good        159    00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.630    afternoon ladies and gentlemen        160    00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:25.000    professors students families I want to        161    00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.300    start by saying it is a truly great        162    00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.180    honor for me to have been invited to        163    00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.500    speak to you today        164    00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:37.810    I really want to offer very warm        165    00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.690    congratulations to the graduating class        166    00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.010    I know from friends who've graduated        167    00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.310    from the Kennedy School and from my own        168    00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.050    teaching here when I was a Fisher fellow        169    00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.970    in 2012 that the standards are high that        170    00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.220    the values of public service are        171    00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.630    enduring and that the ambitions for        172    00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.050    global impact of this school are wholly        173    00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.910    in keeping with the legacy of John F        174    00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.440    Kennedy I also know it's very very tough        175    00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.729    to get in but once you do make it here        176    00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:18.520    the sense of collegiality and teamwork        177    00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.000    is really very striking indeed and I        178    00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.600    want to remark also on the fantastic a        179    00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.690    diversity of the student population        180    00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.070    international diversity that is        181    00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.060    inspiring in its breadth and in its debt        182    00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.289    but I also want to say this that while        183    00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:40.240    your origins are diverse the commitment        184    00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.909    to provide practical answers to advance        185    00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:45.520    the social good is really inspiring so        186    00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.200    individually and collectively you have        187    00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.360    my real admiration I also want to take        188    00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.790    30 seconds just to thank the unsung        189    00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.790    heroes of this occasion who are the        190    00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:59.260    families of those of you who are        191    00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.010    graduating tomorrow you're the quiet        192    00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.080    heroes of the student experience all the        193    00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.260    bills and none of the fun as I was once        194    00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.050    told but certainly from my own        195    00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.880    experience I know students can't make it        196    00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.620    without their the support of their        197    00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.120    families and I think it's important to        198    00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.130    recognize that and if        199    00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.870    I also think it's worth pausing to        200    00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.240    recognize that there would be no class        201    00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.350    at all without outstanding teachers and        202    00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.880    while it's invidious to pick out a        203    00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.079    single person        204    00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.480    I think it's right to recognize that        205    00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.380    after 11 very successful years as an        206    00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:50.000    inspiring caring and enquiring Dean        207    00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.680    David Ellwood deserves your special        208    00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.279    thanks and appreciation        209    00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:06.410    I also want to strike a personal note        210    00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:07.940    it's always special for me to come back        211    00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.390    to Cambridge Massachusetts because in        212    00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.660    the 1970s as a twelve-year-old school        213    00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.520    boy I came to live in Newton        214    00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.500    Massachusetts just next door that's the        215    00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.870    town next door I attended junior high        216    00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.990    school I played the role of Mayor Slade        217    00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:28.010    in the musical Destry rides again it was        218    00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.110    a musical in which I was banned from        219    00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.570    either singing or dancing so my        220    00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.370    contribution was limited but I did play        221    00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.450    the role of the man and in that year of        222    00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.970    1977-78 there began a 40-year        223    00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:44.089    relationship between me and the United        224    00:10:44.089 --> 00:10:45.589    States especially the east coast of the        225    00:10:45.589 --> 00:10:47.750    United States in later years I went to        226    00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.459    graduate school here as well as David        227    00:10:49.459 --> 00:10:53.000    has said my wife is a dual UK US citizen        228    00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.399    my kids were born in the US and we all        229    00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:59.000    now live and work in New York but as        230    00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.250    David has mentioned I have a confession        231    00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.459    to make        232    00:11:04.459 --> 00:11:06.890    which is that although I was presented        233    00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.990    with the choice of studying at the        234    00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.670    Kennedy School I decided not to do so I        235    00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.650    chose instead to fulfill my kennedy        236    00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.620    scholarship down the road at MIT and I'm        237    00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.990    sure that this this wasn't my greatest        238    00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.120    foolishness but it could count as one of        239    00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.930    my early ones this is whenever I come        240    00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.750    back to school it's a reminder of a road        241    00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.330    and not taken just imagine if I'd been        242    00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.620    able to take the course that was on        243    00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.100    offer to my housemates in 1988-89 which        244    00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.320    may well still be on offer today it was        245    00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.630    called then how to be a politician I I        246    00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.010    might have saved myself a lot of trouble        247    00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:49.070    if I'd taken that course because I        248    00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.890    joined the Labour Party in the UK 30        249    00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:54.950    years ago that makes me feel old I was a        250    00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.450    member of parliament for 12 years from        251    00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.209    2001 I was proud to be a minister for        252    00:11:59.209 --> 00:12:01.310    eight years in a Labour government in        253    00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:02.959    the UK including three years as foreign        254    00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:05.570    secretary and people sometimes say to me        255    00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.750    often say to me well how did it happen        256    00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.790    what made it happen and the truth is        257    00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:14.660    that my big bro break owed a lot to        258    00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.870    I was in the backroom in the early 1990s        259    00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.390    when labour in Britain figured out how        260    00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.580    to win elections rather than lose them        261    00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.310    as this month's election in the UK        262    00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.590    showed the electorate have recently sent        263    00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.720    us back to the classroom for the second        264    00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.800    time in five years today I'm very proud        265    00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.290    indeed to be running the International        266    00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.650    Rescue Committee which as david says has        267    00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.600    16,000 staff in 35 to 40 countries        268    00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.310    around the world as well as in 22        269    00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.680    offices around the u.s resettling new        270    00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:50.240    refugees here and i can reflect on what        271    00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.860    you've been studying on government and        272    00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.620    on politics from the outside rather than        273    00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.030    from the inside and that's what I want        274    00:12:56.030 --> 00:13:00.470    to do this afternoon my first political        275    00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.100    opinions were developed in the 1980s in        276    00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.180    reaction to the politics of Margaret        277    00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.480    Thatcher in the UK after University I        278    00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.050    graduated in 1987 the collapse of        279    00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.930    communism turned international politics        280    00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:19.190    upside down and then in the 1990s in the        281    00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.740    UK but also in the u.s. in continental        282    00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.250    Europe in Australia in South America        283    00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.830    center-left politics was rebuilt as an        284    00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.620    effective fighting force after a lost        285    00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:34.400    decade in the 1980s what drove that        286    00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.010    success what underpinned it I would say        287    00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:41.540    five things first understanding the        288    00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.880    difference between knowing your own mind        289    00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.550    and asserting your own version of        290    00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:47.680    reality        291    00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.480    the former knowing your own mind is        292    00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.250    essential        293    00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.260    the latter defining your own reality is        294    00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.890    dangerous the best politicians recognise        295    00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:00.320    the facts and then apply their values        296    00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.170    rather than making the facts fit the        297    00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.190    reality they've organized in advance        298    00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:09.560    second recognising the importance of        299    00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.360    tackling fundamental problems rather        300    00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.870    than evading them President Eisenhower's        301    00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:18.410    advice I think still holds when you        302    00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:22.760    cannot solve a problem enlarge it in all        303    00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.890    the talk of the management books and        304    00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:26.360    maybe even at the Kennedy School of        305    00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.100    quick wins and        306    00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.490    hanging fruit what's important can get        307    00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:34.550    lost but the top politicians never        308    00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:38.510    confuse tactical froth with strategic        309    00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:43.010    choices third I learnt the importance of        310    00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:45.590    embracing the reality that ideas really        311    00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.470    matter in politics argument not        312    00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.470    arithmetic is what counts if there is a        313    00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.230    Bush Clinton rematch in the u.s. next        314    00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.470    year the decisive issue will be which        315    00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.060    one of them has the biggest ideas for        316    00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.890    the future of the country because        317    00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:06.640    something always beats nothing fourth        318    00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.020    spotting that so much which seems        319    00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.720    important the media at any one time is        320    00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.730    actually not so far more important than        321    00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.430    what's in the headlines is often the        322    00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.610    decisions not taken not taken in order        323    00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.320    to avoid controversy in the short term        324    00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.410    but the risk of allowing problems to        325    00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:27.680    fester in the long term and then fifth        326    00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.630    and finally perhaps most important        327    00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.910    learning as I hope you have at this        328    00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:34.370    school that government can be a great        329    00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.490    force for good but it requires a cast of        330    00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.700    mind that I would describe as        331    00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.890    entrepreneurial that is the role of        332    00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:46.910    politics to add entrepreneurship to        333    00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:49.460    necessary bureaucracy its role is to        334    00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.830    create the space for innovation and that        335    00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.500    means constantly being alive to the need        336    00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.140    and the importance of reinventing what        337    00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.680    government does and how it does it and        338    00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.730    that's what I want to talk to you about        339    00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:06.440    today the vital importance for all of us        340    00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.300    whichever country we're returning to        341    00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.030    after studying here the vital importance        342    00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.400    of reinventing what we do in        343    00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.950    humanitarian affairs and in foreign        344    00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:21.080    policy now you've probably all realized        345    00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.710    or your parents have by choosing this        346    00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.680    school you didn't set yourselves up for        347    00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.810    the most lucrative careers that are        348    00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.900    available after all you did not choose        349    00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.600    the law school or the business school        350    00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.660    don't your parents know it probably but        351    00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.080    the imperative that you have embraced        352    00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.240    understand how to solve complex problems        353    00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.260    of public policy is to me incredibly        354    00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:51.940    important your mission and these words        355    00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.390    can risk naivety is to commit yourselves        356    00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.340    to make the world a better place to make        357    00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.770    a difference as the school enjoins you        358    00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:02.770    now I don't regard that impulse as naive        359    00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.350    and I certainly don't regard it as        360    00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:08.230    anything other than necessary right now        361    00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.870    as you survey the world that you're        362    00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:13.089    going to go into there are plenty of        363    00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:15.670    domestic policy challenges that you can        364    00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.620    get your teeth into stagnant        365    00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.720    middle-class wages pension liabilities        366    00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.810    youth unemployment from Egypt to South        367    00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.600    Africa to France and these are major        368    00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.450    questions and everywhere the debate is        369    00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.940    vigorous and there are solutions being        370    00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.000    canvassed but what I want to put to you        371    00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.150    today is the same cannot be said of        372    00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.550    foreign policy there is not the same        373    00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:41.620    energy or imagination going into foreign        374    00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.990    policy solutions as there is in domestic        375    00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.590    policy as President Obama said in the        376    00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.810    middle of last year switch on the news        377    00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:51.130    and you would think the world is going        378    00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.820    to hell now that the world though is a        379    00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.430    global village the question we confront        380    00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.110    in foreign policy is actually the same        381    00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:02.440    as the question we face in domestic        382    00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.030    policy how we can live as Keynes said        383    00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:10.330    quote not just wisely and agreeably but        384    00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:15.040    also well wisely so that we sustain the        385    00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.480    nourishment of the planet for future        386    00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.590    generations agreeably so that human        387    00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:23.410    difference is a source of wonder not        388    00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:27.280    enmity and well so the fruits of        389    00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.100    progress are properly shared and for        390    00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.510    that we need the same degree of        391    00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.790    entrepreneurialism idealism passion        392    00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:37.200    energy that's there in domestic policy        393    00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.660    it's really extraordinary if you think        394    00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.990    about it that the world's population has        395    00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:47.680    never been healthier wealthier better        396    00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.310    educated better connected but at the        397    00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.110    same time the number of people displaced        398    00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:54.850    by conflict and disaster        399    00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.220    has never been higher the number of        400    00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.470    states around the world pray too chaotic        401    00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.080    violence oh that's good is that someone        402    00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.850    asked for the motor to be switched off        403    00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:08.410    next door that's everyone here um I        404    00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:09.940    promise you I won't start again and go        405    00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.880    through it all again but the number of        406    00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.800    so the number of people displaced by        407    00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.040    conflict and disaster is at record highs        408    00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:21.190    while actually the sources of democracy        409    00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.320    and hope in a way certainly of economic        410    00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.890    advancement have never been greater        411    00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.870    states pray too chaotic violence and        412    00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.480    international system that is weaker and        413    00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.830    more divided than for a generation        414    00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:36.760    demand our attention but what's actually        415    00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.850    happening in politics around the world        416    00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.560    what's actually happening is that the        417    00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.750    traditionally strong international        418    00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:47.730    powers notably in Western countries are        419    00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:52.900    reining themselves in in the u.s. to be        420    00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.810    honest the danger is that the priority        421    00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.180    of nation-building at home becomes a        422    00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:01.330    recipe for neglect of engagement abroad        423    00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:05.230    and in the UK my own country we're one        424    00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.790    of the most open and globally engaged        425    00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.400    cultures in the world our aid department        426    00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.810    the Department rational development is a        427    00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.360    world leader but politically we're in        428    00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.880    retreat the defence budgets going down        429    00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.230    there's a referendum on whether or not        430    00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.300    we should even stay in the European        431    00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.480    Union and meanwhile outside the Western        432    00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.140    world the emerging powers are leery        433    00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.090    about engaging in politics beyond their        434    00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:32.440    own region and what's the result in my        435    00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.230    judgment the result is a vacuum in the        436    00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:38.010    global Commons trade deals are stalled        437    00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.810    environment is under assault new wars        438    00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:44.680    are starting as old wars refused to fade        439    00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.220    and the most vivid the most distressing        440    00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.710    and the most dangerous example of what I        441    00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:54.280    mean is in Syria today and there are        442    00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.250    some students from Jordan and Turkey and        443    00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.140    Lebanon in Iran at this school there may        444    00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.320    even be students from Syria Syria is        445    00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.170    where all the problems and the absence        446    00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.450    of solutions of modern foreign policy        447    00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:08.650    come together        448    00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:10.990    so much so that the human consequences        449    00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.180    are losing their capacity to shock and        450    00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.630    the best leading indicator of that is        451    00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.160    that what's going on in Syria is no        452    00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.220    longer considered newsworthy the really        453    00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.660    shocking aspect of what's happening in        454    00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.170    Syria is the extraordinary absence of a        455    00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.000    political process to seek to solve the        456    00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.250    problem or even impetus towards a        457    00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.950    political process instead amid desperate        458    00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:35.250    and declining and dangerous silence        459    00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:38.350    Syria is declining into a version of        460    00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.110    hell and its problems are being exported        461    00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:44.020    to its neighbours I just want to recap        462    00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.960    for you the scale of the disaster that        463    00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.900    is unfolding in an absolutely critical        464    00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.700    part of the world it's not an        465    00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.280    exaggeration to say it's a disaster of        466    00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.110    biblical proportions        467    00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.300    perhaps an especially apposite thing to        468    00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.929    say given its focus on Syria since March        469    00:22:01.929 --> 00:22:05.980    2001 that's just four years ago the        470    00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.559    conflict has claimed 260,000 lives at        471    00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:10.120    least some estimates put it at twice        472    00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.760    that every second Syrian is in need of        473    00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.590    humanitarian help out of a population of        474    00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.960    22 million there are three million        475    00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.760    children inside and outside the country        476    00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.530    who've been robbed of their future        477    00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:21.850    because there's no school for them to go        478    00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:25.840    to inside the country the humanitarian        479    00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.170    disaster is not an unfortunate byproduct        480    00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:32.350    of conflict it's the intended result of        481    00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.210    a strategy being pursued by the        482    00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.809    government of Syria to win its war the        483    00:22:37.809 --> 00:22:39.640    bombs of the government of Syria last        484    00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.559    week killed seven of the people being        485    00:22:41.559 --> 00:22:45.720    served by us in Italy in Italy but City        486    00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.220    the water and electrical supplies of        487    00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.170    more than two million people in Aleppo        488    00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:53.080    under are were willfully disrupted by        489    00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.240    warring parties in February more than        490    00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.650    half of the hospitals of the country        491    00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.390    have been damaged or destroyed this is a        492    00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:59.830    middle class country that we're talking        493    00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.890    about the aid on offer is not keeping        494    00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:04.570    pace with the scale of the problem water        495    00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.000    food shelter health care sanitation        496    00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.429    hygiene services all desperately needed        497    00:23:09.429 --> 00:23:15.010    and the UN aid appeal for 2015 is 19%        498    00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:18.580    filled five months into the calendar        499    00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:22.179    year and of course the conflict is not        500    00:23:22.179 --> 00:23:22.690    being        501    00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.030    tained within the borders of Syria the        502    00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.430    burden on the neighbors is huge turkey        503    00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.010    has become the largest refugee hosting        504    00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:32.920    country in the world one in four of the        505    00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.690    population of Lebanon is now a Syrian        506    00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.330    the third largest city in Jordan is a        507    00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.450    refugee camp and I would put it to you        508    00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:42.100    that while some things are complicated        509    00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.500    and you can understand why they're not        510    00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.250    being done        511    00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.620    others are relatively simple and when        512    00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:49.270    they're not done it's closer to a crime        513    00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:53.980    than a tragedy we know that over 300        514    00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.470    thousand Syrian children in Lebanon are        515    00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:00.850    getting no education at all we know also        516    00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:04.270    that Western countries have been        517    00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:07.420    extraordinarily reluctant to admit the        518    00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.510    most vulnerable Syrians as refugees the        519    00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:12.520    US figure is actually remarkable because        520    00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.620    the US has historically been a world        521    00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.870    leader in refugee resettlement taking        522    00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.400    about seventy five thousand people a        523    00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.040    year for the last four years the sum        524    00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.600    total of Syrians who've been admitted to        525    00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.980    the United States is eight hundred and        526    00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.100    forty two the figures for most European        527    00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.890    countries are similar Germany to be fair        528    00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:33.910    has committed to resettle 30,000 now if        529    00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:37.390    I stood here four years ago and said        530    00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.310    that I predicted there will be 12        531    00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:40.930    million in humanitarian need four        532    00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.540    million refugees 260 thousand dead and        533    00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:47.170    that the international peace effort that        534    00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:48.760    was consistent with that scale of        535    00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:53.020    suffering was one un envoi seeking a        536    00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.370    temporary ceasefire in one Syrian city I        537    00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:59.340    don't think you would have accepted that        538    00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:02.350    but that's actually what's happening        539    00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:06.430    today and leave to one side that Iraq        540    00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:08.920    which has caught the contagion deserves        541    00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.190    a lecture all of its own I would put it        542    00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.620    to you that over the last four years we        543    00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.860    have proved the risks not of doing too        544    00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.710    much but of doing too little we've shown        545    00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:23.170    in the terrible unfolding but not to        546    00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.410    take action is an action of consequence        547    00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:28.690    every bit as grave as intervention        548    00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.790    itself in fact many of the real dangers        549    00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:34.180    of Western engagement a refugee crisis        550    00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.860    the use of chemical weapons the        551    00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:36.659    incitement of its        552    00:25:36.659 --> 00:25:40.649    Preem ISM have happened anyway and the        553    00:25:40.649 --> 00:25:42.840    reasons for this I think are sadly clear        554    00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.690    the diplomatic determination imagination        555    00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.679    energy that's required to end the war        556    00:25:48.679 --> 00:25:53.460    has ebbed and today left to one UN envoy        557    00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:57.570    all but disappeared you can find the        558    00:25:57.570 --> 00:25:59.549    excuses deteriorating relations between        559    00:25:59.549 --> 00:26:02.249    the US and Russia over Ukraine the        560    00:26:02.249 --> 00:26:04.739    rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran        561    00:26:04.739 --> 00:26:06.539    rifts between the backers of the        562    00:26:06.539 --> 00:26:08.970    different Syrian opposition groups and        563    00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:11.789    of course the very high price of the        564    00:26:11.789 --> 00:26:13.830    mistakes of the West in Iraq and        565    00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.749    Afghanistan which have sat the        566    00:26:15.749 --> 00:26:17.940    confidence that Western powers will do        567    00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.859    anything other than make things worse        568    00:26:19.859 --> 00:26:23.070    and Drain support for anything other        569    00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:25.019    than hand-wringing that is the        570    00:26:25.019 --> 00:26:27.720    explanation for the UK is almost total        571    00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.700    absence from the political as well as        572    00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:33.299    the military battlefield Syria's descent        573    00:26:33.299 --> 00:26:34.190    into hell        574    00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:37.139    therefore raises I would argue very hard        575    00:26:37.139 --> 00:26:39.299    questions for the humanitarian sector        576    00:26:39.299 --> 00:26:41.970    that is now in the front line and for        577    00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:44.039    foreign policy and I just want to touch        578    00:26:44.039 --> 00:26:48.210    on both let me just start with the        579    00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:50.460    humanitarian response which is at the        580    00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:56.479    same time essential but also partial in        581    00:26:56.479 --> 00:26:58.979    2013 for the first time since World War        582    00:26:58.979 --> 00:27:01.590    two the number of refugees asylum        583    00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.070    seekers and internally displaced people        584    00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:07.440    exceeded 50 million that was one refugee        585    00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.440    every five seconds more than half of the        586    00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.999    displaced people are now in urban areas        587    00:27:11.999 --> 00:27:14.970    about quarter in refugee camps conflicts        588    00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:17.309    and complex emergencies like Syria but        589    00:27:17.309 --> 00:27:19.470    also Somalia Afghanistan        590    00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:21.869    the Democratic Republic of Congo now        591    00:27:21.869 --> 00:27:24.539    Yemen account for about three-quarters        592    00:27:24.539 --> 00:27:27.899    of these crises and this sector the        593    00:27:27.899 --> 00:27:29.970    humanitarian sector delivers about 22        594    00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.369    billion dollars of aid a year to people        595    00:27:32.369 --> 00:27:36.179    affected but the gap between how much is        596    00:27:36.179 --> 00:27:37.769    needed and how much is given is growing        597    00:27:37.769 --> 00:27:41.669    not shrinking and here's the mismatch as        598    00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:43.109    well but it's not just about the amount        599    00:27:43.109 --> 00:27:45.629    of money the humanitarian sector is        600    00:27:45.629 --> 00:27:48.210    designed to address the victims of wars        601    00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.010    between states        602    00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:51.840    yet more and more we're dealing with        603    00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.960    those affected by wars within states ie        604    00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.370    civil wars 33 of them in 2013 the sector        605    00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:00.870    is designed around the responsibilities        606    00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:03.000    of Nations yet more and more we're        607    00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.100    working where conflict involves        608    00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:08.340    non-state actors the sector is designed        609    00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.750    around a model of service provision        610    00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.850    based on refugee camps yet        611    00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:13.350    three-quarters of those displaced are        612    00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:15.929    not in camps and this displaced        613    00:28:15.929 --> 00:28:18.330    population is increasingly young female        614    00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.280    and displaced for a very long time        615    00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.799    the average refugee is out of their own        616    00:28:22.799 --> 00:28:24.770    country for about 20 years        617    00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.240    that means there's a whole new agenda        618    00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.610    for the humanitarian sector of which the        619    00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:32.760    IRC is a part but donors to become much        620    00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.470    clearer about the outcomes that they're        621    00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:37.590    seeking for the evidence base of what        622    00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:40.290    works to be radically improved for        623    00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:41.700    interventions like cash distribution        624    00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.320    rather than the provision of goods and        625    00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.730    services to be embraced because that's        626    00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:46.350    the way of giving power to the people        627    00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:47.640    who are actually affected by these        628    00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.520    crises and for a new compact between        629    00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.679    displaced people and the communities        630    00:28:52.679 --> 00:28:54.809    they arrived in and the international        631    00:28:54.809 --> 00:28:56.460    community about the economic and social        632    00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.520    support for peoples and nations bearing        633    00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.770    the burden of refugee flows I don't know        634    00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:03.419    how many people here have followed the        635    00:29:03.419 --> 00:29:05.669    crisis in the Mediterranean of southern        636    00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:08.429    Europe but that speaks to a complete        637    00:29:08.429 --> 00:29:10.530    imbalance of responsibility both between        638    00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:13.669    the European nations and further afield        639    00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:16.530    but even if we double the scale and the        640    00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:18.090    effectiveness of the humanitarian effort        641    00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:20.280    it will never be enough was it's only        642    00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.620    ever clearing up the debris once        643    00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.390    something is broken by definition its        644    00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:27.540    crisis management and so we have to look        645    00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.850    where it's incumbent on us to look at        646    00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:32.840    global politics for solutions as well        647    00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.940    I'm sure some of you here studied that        648    00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.940    in 2005 the world came together to        649    00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:39.960    assert something called the        650    00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.919    responsibility to protect / 119 Nations        651    00:29:43.919 --> 00:29:46.980    signed up to the doctrine that rulers        652    00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.200    had obligations to their peoples and if        653    00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.940    the Covenant was broken and needs        654    00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:52.200    national community had a responsibility        655    00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.660    to fulfill those obligations the        656    00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.150    civilians concerned this was in the        657    00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:01.049    context of the Rwandan genocide over 50        658    00:30:01.049 --> 00:30:03.810    million people today need that        659    00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:06.390    sponsibility to be reasserted the norms        660    00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:09.570    and laws of war to be reaffirmed the        661    00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:11.130    rights of women and girls to be free of        662    00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:14.040    abuse to be affirmed as universal not        663    00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.740    Western values and the tools to underpin        664    00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.420    these rights and norms need to be        665    00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.700    sharpened and I want to use this        666    00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:23.820    occasion to mention two very practical        667    00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:25.110    things that need to change in        668    00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:28.620    international politics in my view one        669    00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.080    concerns the UN Security Council which        670    00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.970    has as its mandate the requirement that        671    00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:34.590    it consider all matters that are a        672    00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:37.190    threat to regional peace and security I        673    00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:40.890    would argue that humanitarian atrocities        674    00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:43.050    fall into that category because their        675    00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.610    impact spills over into neighboring        676    00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:46.680    states never mind because it causes        677    00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.150    political destabilization you'll know        678    00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:52.890    that in the Syria crisis Russia and        679    00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:55.380    China vetoed three Security Council        680    00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.420    resolutions designed to hold the Syrian        681    00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.370    government to account for the        682    00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:02.220    humanitarian mass atrocities they were        683    00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.440    vetoed and of course there's history in        684    00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.950    this just to remind you some of you        685    00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.240    apartheid was condemned by the UN        686    00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.760    General Assembly in 1966 as a crime        687    00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.910    against humanity ten draft resolutions        688    00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:16.680    that followed was sought to import        689    00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.900    impose sanctions were then vetoed in the        690    00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:22.650    UN Security Council after 1966 what's        691    00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:25.350    the way around this I think the French        692    00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:27.150    Foreign Minister mr. fab use has come up        693    00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:28.260    with something important and interesting        694    00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:31.100    he's proposed a new code of conduct        695    00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.270    concerning the use of the UN Security        696    00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:35.850    Council veto in situations of genocide        697    00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:39.150    war crimes and ethnic cleansing his plan        698    00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:41.130    is that each member a permanent member        699    00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:43.080    of the Security Council should suspend        700    00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.360    their right of veto in cases of mass        701    00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.390    atrocity it's an idea that first came up        702    00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:50.940    in 2001 Madeleine Albright William Cohen        703    00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.100    former Secretary of State and defense        704    00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.690    sector in the u.s. pursued the same        705    00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:57.270    thought and of course there are issues        706    00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:59.520    to be addressed about how you define a        707    00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.640    mass atrocity and countries might use        708    00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.170    their veto anyway was this his only a        709    00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:06.480    voluntary suspension but that would be        710    00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.360    to their moral and political cost a new        711    00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.340    norm would be established in        712    00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.080    international politics and if it did        713    00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.240    nothing else it would provide a firm a        714    00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.430    moral footing but countries that wanted        715    00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.810    to pursue        716    00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:21.200    other forms of intervention in my time        717    00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.210    as foreign minister I never used the        718    00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:25.520    veto in the Security Council in fact the        719    00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.670    UK hasn't used it since 1989 and so I        720    00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:30.290    want today to endorse the French        721    00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:32.510    proposal for a voluntary limitation of        722    00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:34.250    the veto and call on others to do so as        723    00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:37.550    well it would raise the costs of turning        724    00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:39.830    a blind eye and increase the pressure        725    00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:42.650    not to do so the second and final        726    00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:44.800    example I want to give concerns UN        727    00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:49.070    peacekeeping few people know that over a        728    00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.110    hundred thousand troops police and        729    00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.930    military experts from 122 countries are        730    00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:56.060    undertaking 16 UN missions around the        731    00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.880    world total cost is about eight eight        732    00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.040    and a half billion dollars the bills are        733    00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.350    played in the main by the West the u.s.        734    00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:04.940    pays about a quarter of the total cost        735    00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.250    and the missions are increasingly        736    00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:10.490    dangerous complex and long and the        737    00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:13.600    results if I'm honest are frankly mixed        738    00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.680    there are a number of reasons but one        739    00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.410    reason is the refusal of the strongest        740    00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:20.570    military powers to deploy under UN        741    00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:23.560    auspices in the US this has legal force        742    00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.450    since the 1994 presidential directive        743    00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:28.730    insisting that all US troops must always        744    00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:31.760    be under US command in the UK as the        745    00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.400    result of inertia we post less than 300        746    00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.900    servicemen and women to UN missions        747    00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.650    compared to about 10,000 in 1994 but        748    00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:41.660    it's not just the US and UK European        749    00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.730    peacekeepers down to around 6,000 and        750    00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:46.760    it's not just about numbers because what        751    00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.250    these UN missions need is intelligence        752    00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:53.180    engineers airlift bomb disposal officer        753    00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.860    experienced officers and leadership and        754    00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.050    so it's very very important that the        755    00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:59.090    signs of a new interest in UN        756    00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:02.210    peacekeeping from Amanda from Ambassador        757    00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:04.040    Samantha power who spoke here last year        758    00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.930    President Obama promising to chair a        759    00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:07.400    special session of the Security Council        760    00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.010    in September the UN Security Council        761    00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:11.720    setting up a review of peacekeeping        762    00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:14.000    operations it's very very important that        763    00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000    those reviews come to something I would        764    00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.820    argue that at a time of cuts in defence        765    00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.390    budgets new an asymmetric threat threats        766    00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:24.620    record numbers of people fleeing        767    00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:27.050    conflict the case for strengthened and        768    00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:29.140    more fairly shared UN peacekeeping is        769    00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:31.520    overwhelming        770    00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.560    but what peacekeepers need above all is        771    00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.750    for the parties to the conflict to see a        772    00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:38.240    path to compromise that involves a share        773    00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.820    of power and not surrender civilians        774    00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:41.870    need that too        775    00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:44.510    in other words peacekeeping is only as        776    00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:47.390    good as the political vision it serves        777    00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:49.460    and in the UN that is currently        778    00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.669    separated into two different departments        779    00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:54.260    the peacekeeping review needs to have as        780    00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.929    its major conclusion a commitment to        781    00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:59.180    link the peacekeeping missions of the UN        782    00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.880    to its political diplomacy and I can        783    00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.470    tell you from our own experience in war        784    00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:08.480    zones civilians need both these ideas        785    00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.790    about foreign policy can seem abstruse        786    00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:14.270    and even academic maybe academic is not        787    00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:18.050    a swear word in this institution but I        788    00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:20.300    would argue that the debate needs to be        789    00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.660    broadened out a long way and I think you        790    00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.120    the graduates of this school have a very        791    00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.910    important responsibility in this well I        792    00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:31.340    think you've learned here is how to turn        793    00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.540    passion into practical politics and        794    00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.600    sometimes that is dismissed as        795    00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.490    quote/unquote technocratic there's        796    00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:41.780    nothing wrong with being technocratic        797    00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:43.700    but I would say you should never lose        798    00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.130    sight of the passion which was the        799    00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:47.900    impetus to make a difference in the        800    00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:51.290    first place and I have to tell you that        801    00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:54.050    there is a view abroad that your        802    00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:56.030    generation this generation of graduates        803    00:35:56.030 --> 00:36:00.770    is an apathetic generation Pope Francis        804    00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:03.380    has gone as far as to bemoan what he        805    00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.940    calls the globalization of indifference        806    00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:09.200    now I have to tell you that's not what I        807    00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.470    see on university campuses in the u.s.        808    00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.660    in Pakistan in the Middle East where        809    00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:17.510    I've spoken in the last year in the        810    00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:20.150    complex murky but magnificent world we        811    00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:22.910    live in it's easy to get lost in the        812    00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:25.430    detail and forget that what inspired you        813    00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:26.630    to join a school of government in the        814    00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:29.510    first place was a passionate desire to        815    00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:31.550    see a problem alleviated and the world        816    00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:34.600    improved and my message to you today is        817    00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.430    never forget that never lose that sense        818    00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:40.670    of passion others have done it in some        819    00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:42.140    ways in much more difficult        820    00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:44.480    circumstances than we face today        821    00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.770    and we're standing on their moral and        822    00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:49.970    institutional shoulders I want to give        823    00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:53.300    you a very specific example in 1931 a        824    00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.730    young man called Varian Frei left this        825    00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:58.339    University to work as a foreign        826    00:36:58.339 --> 00:36:59.869    correspondent for an American journal        827    00:36:59.869 --> 00:37:02.660    called living age it was while he was in        828    00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.240    Berlin in 1935 that he witnessed the        829    00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.730    abuse of the Jews in Germany at that        830    00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:09.530    time he wrote fearlessly about this        831    00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:12.380    subject the New York Times but then he        832    00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.180    concluded that it wasn't enough to be a        833    00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:16.250    commentator about the state of the world        834    00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:17.990    he had a responsibility to do something        835    00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.970    about it        836    00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:21.740    Varian Frei helped create what became        837    00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.380    the International Rescue Committee the        838    00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:26.270    organization I now lead he risked his        839    00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:28.520    life to help Jews flee the Vichy regime        840    00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.550    from Marseille in the south of France he        841    00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:34.130    smuggled more than 2,000 people across        842    00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:36.349    the border into neutral Portugal and        843    00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:38.630    from there on to safety in the United        844    00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:41.480    States and in his in a letter to his        845    00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:44.839    wife in 1941 he said among the people        846    00:37:44.839 --> 00:37:46.760    who have come into my office and not        847    00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.530    only some of the greatest living authors        848    00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:50.839    painters and sculptors of Europe but        849    00:37:50.839 --> 00:37:52.339    also former cabinet ministers and even        850    00:37:52.339 --> 00:37:53.569    prime ministers of half a dozen        851    00:37:53.569 --> 00:37:56.960    countries what a strange place Europe is        852    00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.359    when men and women like this are reduced        853    00:37:59.359 --> 00:38:01.940    to patiently waiting in the anteroom of        854    00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.430    a young American of no importance        855    00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:05.440    whatsoever        856    00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:10.450    now Varian Frei was right on every point        857    00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:13.700    except the last one because he was far        858    00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.890    from unimportant in fact he held the        859    00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:17.329    difference for those people between life        860    00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:20.480    and death and he was the man who helped        861    00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.210    people whose names you will know Hannah        862    00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:26.060    Aaron's Andre Breton Marc Chagall Marcel        863    00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:29.210    Duchamp Gollum an Arthur Koestler were        864    00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:31.540    all rescued from Europe by very and FRA        865    00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:34.940    along with 2,000 others whose names of        866    00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:37.130    course we don't know but who are of        867    00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:39.260    equal and significant importance to this        868    00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:43.400    American story he was a real hero a man        869    00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.560    who went out into the world encountered        870    00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:48.260    injustice and could not rest until he        871    00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.410    put it right many years later he gave an        872    00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:53.240    account of what he did and left us with        873    00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:56.300    if you like a manifesto for a day like        874    00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.309    this a manifesto        875    00:38:58.309 --> 00:38:59.839    those of you who want to go out to do        876    00:38:59.839 --> 00:39:02.269    good in the world I could not remain        877    00:39:02.269 --> 00:39:04.910    idle he said as long as I had any chance        878    00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:07.339    at all of saving even a few of the        879    00:39:07.339 --> 00:39:09.160    intended victims        880    00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.630    ladies and gentlemen students families        881    00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:14.569    professors perhaps we all do not have        882    00:39:14.569 --> 00:39:17.749    the heroism of varium Frey certainly not        883    00:39:17.749 --> 00:39:20.239    but something of his spirit lives in all        884    00:39:20.239 --> 00:39:23.359    of us and certainly it resides in the        885    00:39:23.359

and I had a lot of questions        60    00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.360    coming into today about me about our        61    00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.000    class who are we where are we going what        62    00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.239    is        63    00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.159    gunguru and to find my answers I did        64    00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.920    exactly what my four years of a Harvard        65    00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.480    Education taught me I I Googled it at        66    00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.000    the last minute and found enough very        67    00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.640    specific things to get me participation        68    00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.159    points when we leave Harvard according        69    00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.280    to Wikipedia and xx IV mom 238 on        70    00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.519    College        71    00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.640    Confidential we will leave the Harvard        72    00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.120    class of 2015 and join a new group        73    00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.519    called The Millennials the comp is super        74    00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.280    simple you literally just have to be        75    00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.920    born between 1983 and 2002 so it's like        76    00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.640    almost as easy as writing an opet for        77    00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.720    the        78    00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.400    crimson        79    00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.280    but but guys some of the facts I learned        80    00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.319    about Millennials I feel it my duty to        81    00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.040    impart to you since 2015 is actually the        82    00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.599    year in which the millennial generation        83    00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.599    is poised to overtake the baby boomer        84    00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.480    generation both in terms of numbers of        85    00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.560    people in the workforce and in actual        86    00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.640    physical Force the Baby Boomers are very        87    00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.599    old but we're not beating the previous        88    00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.959    generations at everything for instance        89    00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.439    only 26% of Millennials right now are        90    00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:59.480    married and I just want to throw out        91    00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.439    there that I am available I have an        92    00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:04.560    almost spotless medical history and a        93    00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.159    degree in dramatic arts to fall back on        94    00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.720    if the English thing doesn't work out so        95    00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.079    if anyone would like to beat those odds        96    00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.120    not anyone mostly anyone who's going to        97    00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.160    work at Bane or who shares a name with a        98    00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.040    Harvard        99    00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.250    building or Dean        100    00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.350    [Applause]        101    00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.120    K I also learned that we are staying at        102    00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.120    our jobs for less time 58% of        103    00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.840    Millennials will leave their jobs after        104    00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.240    three years and this one stuck out to me        105    00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.680    because I have a job but also        106    00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.880    because it speaks to I think a type of        107    00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.759    constant creative restlessness Among Us        108    00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.360    or maybe they just fire you after 3        109    00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.800    years if you keep showing up 7 minutes        110    00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.280    late to        111    00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.120    everything but all of this moving around        112    00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.800    between things can also be really        113    00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.919    exciting just look at our speaker today        114    00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.199    Natalie Portman she left Harvard and has        115    00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.039    changed tons of things playing an Bolin        116    00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.919    and Padme and soon jacqulyn        117    00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.080    Kennedy and as a woman I think it's        118    00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.880    really inspiring to know that I can also        119    00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.960    leave Harvard and have so many        120    00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.320    opportunities to be a powerful person's        121    00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.840    wife but        122    00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.800    but changing vocations isn't as easy or        123    00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.319    fun as making a joke about the quad in        124    00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:31.199    your class Day speech guys it's so far        125    00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.639    but        126    00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.360    seriously four out of every 10        127    00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.840    Millennials does not have a job and to        128    00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.240    those unemployed in the class of 2015 I        129    00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.520    say look to the person on your left look        130    00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.080    to the person on your right if you had        131    00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.639    to take too long to decide which        132    00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.360    direction was which that's probably why        133    00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.520    you're        134    00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.680    unemployable but hey Millennials are        135    00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.800    doing great things too 75% of        136    00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.120    Millennials have made a Financial        137    00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.639    donation to a not for-profit institution        138    00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.120    money to UNICEF for vaccines or to the        139    00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.160    Human Rights Campaign for legislative        140    00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.479    fees or to our favorite nonprofit        141    00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.880    Harvard University for        142    00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.919    S more good news 47% of us are tolerant        143    00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.639    of other races in other        144    00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:22.639    groups        145    00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.240    47% that is almost        146    00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.160    half        147    00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.199    and our cultural Horizons are expanding        148    00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:35.720    too 133% of the millennial generation        149    00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.479    has seen a drag show and thanks to        150    00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:41.199    Harvard's Hasty Pudding theatricals 50%        151    00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:42.840    of Harvard's students can audition to be        152    00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.039    in        153    00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.479    one and also just as a public service        154    00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:56.039    announcement statistics also show that        155    00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:58.080    we as a generation are more trusting        156    00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.680    than our predecessors um so I just I        157    00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.560    have to tell you guys there is no $10        158    00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.280    Amazon gift card you just filled out a        159    00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.520    survey you weren't entered in        160    00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.440    anything the fact is we're all going        161    00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.879    into a world of big data that sometimes        162    00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:17.680    thinks it knows us better than we know        163    00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.520    ourselves but we know the percentage        164    00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.560    game better than anyone because before        165    00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.160    we start counting ourselves among the        166    00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.840    61% of Millennials who feel their        167    00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.759    personal responsibility to help the        168    00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:30.440    world or the 39% % who apparently are        169    00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.360    just like        170    00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.360    nah let's not forget that only four        171    00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.919    years ago we sat out here as the storied        172    00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:42.319    6.2% and a        173    00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:46.520    blue and we all swelled with pride        174    00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.199    despite the fact that and I did the math        175    00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:52.080    on this I am and each of you are        176    00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.400    0.6% of the graduating class of 2015 you        177    00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.319    are not even a whole        178    00:07:57.319 --> 00:08:01.520    percent but when I got that email when I        179    00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.000    cried with my parents and gave my little        180    00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.759    sister an inferiority complex that sent        181    00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:07.280    her to        182    00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.280    therapy on IV day hey Tess hey love you        183    00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.520    um on IV Day 2011 I felt like a whole        184    00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.599    percent hey I I felt like 49% and I know        185    00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:21.879    what 49% feels like I got one on an x 10        186    00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:23.520    midterm        187    00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.080    once        188    00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.440    49% it's my first college        189    00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.440    B        190    00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:37.959    the truth is in the grand scheme of        191    00:08:37.959 --> 00:08:41.919    things we each all make up like        192    00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:44.720    0.004% of the millennial        193    00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.160    generation but one of those        194    00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.480    0.004% was the first person to say hi to        195    00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.839    me on campus one of them cast me in my        196    00:08:52.839 --> 00:08:54.959    first big Musical three of them are the        197    00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:57.560    Fulon myth        198    00:08:57.839 --> 00:09:02.079    Department two two of those        199    00:09:02.079 --> 00:09:04.880    0.004% have been to every single show I        200    00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.680    have ever been in on this campus        201    00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.519    100% one of you        202    00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:14.200    0.004% actually left your jacket in my        203    00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.560    room um and I'm mostly packed up but I'm        204    00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.720    just going to send a picture to the list        205    00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.720    and if it's not yours just reply all        206    00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.760    no so as we all go out into the world        207    00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.760    probably according to statistics        208    00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.240    unmarried living with our parents        209    00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.200    trusting philanthropic barely employed        210    00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.720    and racist let's not        211    00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.160    forget let's not forget Mark Twain once        212    00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.880    said that someone else once said that        213    00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.120    there are three types of lies lies damn        214    00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.760    lies and        215    00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.399    statistics Because the Internet doesn't        216    00:09:49.399 --> 00:09:51.000    know all of these things about us        217    00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.160    because it cares it knows because        218    00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.839    Millennials have over a trillion dollars        219    00:09:54.839 --> 00:09:56.399    worth of purchasing power and they're        220    00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:59.600    trying to get us to buy things and even        221    00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.160    though it may be tempting to use these        222    00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.920    numbers to further stratify ourselves        223    00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.880    and compare our successes to those of        224    00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.519    our peers inside and outside of Harvard        225    00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:10.120    let's be the however many percent that        226    00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.200    resist in our quest to beat the odds        227    00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.279    let's not forget to stay odd except you        228    00:10:16.279 -->

rides in Syria would indulge        4    00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.039    in imperialistic fantasies of how we        5    00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.640    wanted to take over the country outside

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.039    would send us to        15    00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.840    prison whereas children here had ghosts        16    00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.280    and the        17

past four years        25    00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.280    I was struck by how true this idea        26    00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.240    was I saw it every everywhere the        27

immigration at Boston        40    00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.239    Logan        41    00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.040    Airport whenever they saw I was coming        42    00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.760    from the Middle East what were you doing        43    00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.440    there why are you here why did God make        44    00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.160    you from the Middle East        45    00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.680    but I made sure I dressed like our        46    00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.400    overly proud Harvard dads with Harvard        47

  00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.879    American dream opened        56    00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.560    wide I saw it everywhere this Harvard        57    00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.720    Nation but I saw it not just in the hard        58    00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.519    structures but more importantly in its        59    00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.120    invisible        60    00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.560    institutions the invisible scaffolds        61    00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.319    around and        62    00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.159    undering the hard        63    00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.799    institutions I saw it in the quarreling        64    00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.040    Columns of the Crimson        65    00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.560    newspaper its Kung Fu fights of ideas        66    00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.480    and Lively student        67    00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.840    debates with the potency to propel        68    00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.560    policy changes by the next morning's        69    00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.680    print I saw it in our cluttered bulletin        70    00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.920    boards bustling with life with        71    00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.680    announcements of student-led conferences        72    00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.720    Broadway worthy shows and dorm room

00:04:05.599    glimpse a trivial detail these cluttered        76    00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.400    boards that often slip        77    00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.760    notice but where some saw        78    00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.079    papers I saw passions purpose creativity        79    00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.600    I saw a        80    00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.600    heartbeat of Civic community's        81    00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.880    vivacity my parents countries were        82    00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.320    places where institutional dysfunction        83    00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.000    killed off this social dynamism and        84    00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.199    vibrant productivity and so I felt        85    00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.240    acutely here the        86    00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.479    value of civil        87    00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.320    society and        88    00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.400    living        89    00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.400    breathing        90    00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.600    institutions my time here would give me        91    00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.320    a working model of a better world not        92    00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.199    only that but that sense of        93    00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.160    empowerment to initiate        94    00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.160    change you see with those spying walls        95    00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.240    still lurking in my memory        96    00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.800    that constrained the little napoleons in        97    00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.120    My Brother and        98    00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.680    Me you might imagine my shock when in        99    00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.080    one of my first classes here I suddenly        100    00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.400    found        101    00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.160    myself        102    00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.560    debating a        103    00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.759    president so it's the 1990s our        104    00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.680    negotiations class Professor set the        105    00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.919    stage a war is about to break out        106    00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.520    between Ecuador and Peru how will you        107    00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.160    stop it I raised my hand to respond wait        108    00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.880    Professor Shapiro stopped        109    00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.560    me tell the president what to do and in        110    00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.080    walked the Ecuadorian        111    00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.240    president in bringing the president to        112    00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.360    me in having me speak to and question a        113    00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.280    shaper of history and experience the        114    00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.880    value he saw in my        115    00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.720    view Harvard would make me feel I too        116    00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.880    could be him I too had the power to        117    00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.000    shape history and not just be passively        118    00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.759    shaped by it that sense of infinite        119    00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:08.039    possibility we have as children to think        120    00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.639    big and Conquer great        121    00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:15.160    things was returned to me here a less        122    00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.280    despotic version of        123    00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.560    it but what seemed intractable problems        124    00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.319    of the world became opportunities for me        125    00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.360    for us to change things        126    00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.120    you know when I first got here my name        127    00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.000    was        128    00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.400    Sarah after Harvard it would become hey        129    00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.599    Harvard with people stuffing        130    00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:43.280    378 years 5,000 Acres of real estate the        131    00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.199    entirety of Widener Library and 32 heads        132    00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:51.240    of state all into my 5'6 in        133    00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.520    self ridiculous as it        134    00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.240    is there's a strange        135    00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.759    reality to it        136    00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:03.960    Arab American Author Renda jar pictures        137    00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.280    inhabiting a new place as running        138    00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.680    Barefoot the skin of our feet collecting        139    00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.000    sand and seeds and rocks and grass until        140    00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.039    we had shoes shoes made of everything        141    00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:15.800    we' picked up as we        142    00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.960    ran and running through Harvard Yard        143    00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.360    over the past four years the skin of our        144    00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.479    feet collecting a world of        145    00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:29.240    experiences we each become this place        146    00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.599    and a strange way each of us picking up        147    00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:34.680    bits of people and history and ideas        148    00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.080    that changed the way we saw the        149    00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.599    world accumulations I hope we will        150    00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:42.639    continue to wear on our        151    00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:45.680    souls and leave a footprint of all the        152    00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.120    best we took from Harvard Yard on our        153    00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.800    new        154    00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.639    destinations and that's why I am hopeful        155    00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:54.599    for the        156    00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:57.159    future I am hopeful because of my dining        157    00:07:57.159 --> 00:07:59.639    hall dinners spent marveling at friends        158    00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:01.360    who while their countries wage bloody        159    00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.159    war against each other are able to carry        160    00:08:04.159 --> 00:08:06.280    out civil conversation and build        161    00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.360    generative projects        162    00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.440    together I am hopeful because of the        163    00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.800    founding mothers and founding fathers of        164    00:08:13.800 -->

as part of the class of        175    00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.399    2014 if we take those revolutions those        176    00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:50.519    great ideas sparked behind Chipotle        177    00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:53.160    burritos and Starbucks coffee cups in        178    00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.399    our version of taher square Harvard        179    00:08:56.399 -->

      6    00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.110    campus I am excited to be here not only        7    00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.240    to address the distinguished graduates        8    00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.260    and alumni at Harvard University's 360        9    00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.200    third commencement but most importantly        10    00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.800    to stand in the exact spot where Oprah        11    00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.820    stood last year        12    00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.760    OMG let me begin with the first order of        13

earned it        16    00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.740    now as cited as these graduates are they        17    00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.350    are probably even more exhausted after        18    00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.130    the past few weeks and parents I am NOT        19    00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.830    referring to their final exams I'm        20    00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.800    talking about the Senior Olympics the        21    00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.320    last-chance deaths and the booze cruise        22    00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.800    I mean the midnight cruise anyways this        23    00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.900    year has been exciting on campus        24    00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.630    Harvard beat Yale for the seventh        25    00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:37.070    straight time in football the men's        26    00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.710    basketball team went to the second round        27    00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.229    of the NCAA tournament for the second        28    00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.350    straight year and the men's squash team        29    00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.280    won the national championship Huda funky        30    00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.090    who'da thunk at harvard and athletic        31    00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.840    powerhouse pretty soon drew they're        32    00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.280    going to be asking whether you have        33    00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.770    academics to go along with your academic        34    00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.729    programs now my personal connection to        35    00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.180    Harvard began back in 1964 when I        36    00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.980    graduated from Johns Hopkins in        37    00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.140    Baltimore and matriculated here at the        38    00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.480    bee school you're probably asking        39    00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.460    yourself or maybe whispering to the        40    00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.040    person next to you how did he ever get        41    00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.920    into Harvard Business School        42    00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.690    particularly since his stellar academic        43    00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.810    record where he always made the top half        44    00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.090    of the class possible I have no idea        45    00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.340    the only people are more surprised than        46    00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.459    me were my professors        47    00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.230    anyways Here I am back in Cambridge and        48    00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.570    I've noticed a few things have changed        49    00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.570    since I was a student here Elsie's a        50    00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.610    sandwich spot I used to love near the        51    00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.660    square is now a burrito shop        52    00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.640    the worst house which had great beer and        53    00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.000    sausage is now an artisanal gastropub        54    00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.260    whatever that is and the old Holyoke        55    00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.200    Center is now named the Smith Campus        56    00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.540    Center don't you just hate it when        57    00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.460    alumni put their names all over        58    00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.880    everything I was thinking about this        59    00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.650    morning as I walked into the Bloomberg        60    00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.030    Center in the Harvard Business School        61    00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.870    campus across the river but the good        62    00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.690    news is Harbor remains what it was when        63    00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.410    I first arrived on campus 50 years ago        64    00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.270    America's most prestigious university        65    00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.180    and like other great universities it        66    00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.340    lies at the heart of the American        67    00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.030    experiment in democracy their purpose is        68    00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.490    not only to advance knowledge but to        69    00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.020    advance the ideals of our nation great        70    00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.430    universities are places where people of        71    00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.630    all backgrounds holding all beliefs        72    00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.000    pursuing all questions can come to study        73    00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.240    and debate their ideas freely and openly        74    00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.880    and today I'd like to talk to you about        75    00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.280    how important it is for that freedom to        76    00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.310    exist for everyone no matter how        77    00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.680    strongly we may disagree with another's        78    00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.280    viewpoint tolerance for other people's        79    00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.790    ideas and the freedom to express your        80    00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.850    own are inseparable values at great        81    00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.720    universities join together they form a        82    00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.120    sacred trust that holds the basis of our        83    00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.210    democratic society but let me tell you        84    00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.660    that trust is perpetually vulnerable to        85    00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.330    the tyrannical tendencies of monix        86    00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.500    mobs and majorities and lately we've        87    00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.140    seen those tennessee tendencies manifest        88    00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.050    themselves too often both on college        89    00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.290    campuses and in our society that's the        90    00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.830    bad news        91    00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.890    and unfortunately I think both Harvard        92    00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.960    and my own City New York have been        93    00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.840    witnesses to this trend        94    00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.050    first for New York City several years        95    00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.540    ago you as you may remember some people        96    00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.520    tried to stop the development of a        97    00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.320    mosque a few blocks from the World Trade        98    00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.410    Center site it was an emotional issue        99    00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.290    and polls showed that two-thirds of        100    00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.360    Americans were against a mosque being        101    00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.730    built there even the anti-defamation        102    00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.730    league widely regarded as a country's        103    00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.860    most ardent defender of religious        104    00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.350    freedom declared its opposition to the        105    00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.380    project the opponents held rallies and        106    00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.050    demonstrations they denounced the        107    00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.510    developers and they demanded that city        108    00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.750    government stop its construction that        109    00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.240    was their right and we protected their        110    00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.970    right to protest but they could not have        111    00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.610    been more wrong and we refused to cave        112    00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.120    in to those demands the idea that        113    00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.120    government would single out a particular        114    00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.340    religion and block its believers and        115    00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.400    only its believers from building a house        116    00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.610    of worship in a particular area is        117    00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.080    diametrically opposed to the moral        118    00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.270    principles that gave rise to our great        119    00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.580    nation and the constitutional        120    00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.650    protections that have sustained it        121    00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.070    our union of 50 states rests on the        122    00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.120    union of two values freedom and        123    00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.700    tolerance and it is that union of values        124    00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.920    that the terrorists who attacked us on        125    00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.950    September 11th 2001 and on April 15th        126    00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.910    2013 found most threatening to them we        127    00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.630    were a godless country but in fact there        128    00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.120    is no country that protects the core of        129    00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.310    every faith and philosophy known to        130    00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.670    humankind free will more than the United        131    00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:58.140    States of America and and that        132    00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.140    protection however rests upon our        133    00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.350    constant vigilance we like to think that        134    00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.850    the principle of separation of church        135    00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.940    and state is settled it is not and it        136    00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.090    never will be it is up to us to guard it        137    00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.850    fiercely and to ensure that equality        138    00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.610    under the law means equality under the        139    00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.330    law for everyone if you want the freedom        140    00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.780    to worship as you wish to speak as you        141    00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.590    wish and to marry whom you wish you must        142    00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.040    tolerate my freedom to do so or not to        143    00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.850    do so as well now what I do may offend        144    00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.880    you you may find my actions immoral or        145    00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.419    unjust but attempting to restrict my        146    00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:44.910    freedoms in ways that you would not        147    00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.460    restrict your own leads only to        148    00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.030    injustice we cannot deny others the        149    00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.400    rights and privileges that we demand for        150    00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.300    ourselves and that is true in cities and        151    00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.820    it is no less true at universities where        152    00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.160    the forces of repression appear to be        153    00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.210    stronger now        154    00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.400    I think than they have been at any time        155    00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.540    since the 1950s when I was growing up        156    00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.790    u.s. senator guess you can uh plug        157    00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.550    when I was growing up US Senator Joe        158    00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.520    McCarthy was asking are you now or have        159    00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.450    you ever been he was attempting to        160    00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.850    repress and criminalize those who        161    00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.640    sympathize with an economic system that        162    00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.000    was even then failing        163    00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.130    McCarthy's Red Scare destroyed thousands        164    00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.420    of lives but what was he so afraid of an        165    00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.060    idea in this case communism that he and        166    00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.270    others deemed dangerous but he was right        167    00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.290    about one thing        168    00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.040    ideas can be dangerous they can change        169    00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.760    society they can upend traditions they        170    00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.430    can start revolutions and that's why        171    00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.020    throughout history those in authority        172    00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.020    have tried to repress the ideas that        173    00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.290    threaten their power their religion        174    00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.080    their ideology or their reelection        175    00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.740    chances this was true for Socrates and        176    00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.770    Galileo it was true for nelson mandela        177    00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.320    mandela and vaclav havel        178    00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.710    and it has been true for AI weiwei        179    00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.570    Riot and the kids who made the happy        180    00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.680    video in Iran repressing free expression        181    00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.440    expression is a natural human weakness        182    00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.440    and it is up to us to fight it at every        183    00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.040    turn intolerance of ideas whether        184    00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.040    liberal or conservative is antithetical        185    00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.620    to individual rights and free societies        186    00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.530    and it is no less antithetical to great        187    00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:48.250    universities and first-rate scholarships        188    00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.720    now there is an idea floating around        189    00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.150    college campuses including here at        190    00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.670    Harvard I think that scholars should be        191    00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.460    funded only if their work conforms to a        192    00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.730    particular view of justice there's a        193    00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.000    word for that idea censorship and is        194    00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.870    just a modern form of McCarthyism think        195    00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.560    about the irony in the 1950s the right        196    00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.110    wing was attempting to repress left-wing        197    00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.890    ideas today on many college campuses        198    00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:20.840    it is liberals trying to repress        199    00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.960    conservative ideas even as conservative        200    00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.640    faculty members are at risk of becoming        201    00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.130    an        202    00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.650    endangered species and that is probably        203    00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.530    nowhere it's true more true than it is        204    00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.710    here in the Ivy League in the 2012        205    00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.810    presidential race according to federal        206    00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:43.800    yesterday in the 2012 presidential race        207    00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.230    race according to Federal Election        208    00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:50.100    Commission data 96% of all campaign        209    00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.530    contributions from Ivy League faculty        210    00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:56.670    and employees went to Barack Obama 96        211    00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:00.390    percent there was there was more        212    00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.460    disagreement among the old Soviet        213    00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.500    Politburo than there was among Ivy        214    00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.650    League donors and that statistic should        215    00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.750    give us some pause and I say that as        216    00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.790    someone who endorsed President Obama for        217    00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.890    re-election because let me tell you        218    00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.230    something neither party has a monopoly        219    00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:26.010    on truth or God on its side when when 96        220    00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.590    percent of Ivy League donors prefer one        221    00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.110    candidate to another you really have to        222    00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.400    wonder where the students are being        223    00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.400    exposed to the diversity of views that a        224    00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.610    great university should offer diversity        225    00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.130    of gender ethnicity and orientation is        226    00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.620    important but a university cannot be        227    00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.040    great        228    00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.020    if it's faculty is politically        229    00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:51.260    homogeneous in fact the whole purpose of        230    00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.140    in fact the whole purpose of granting        231    00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.350    tenure to professes into it to ensure        232    00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.270    that they feel free to conduct research        233    00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:02.390    on ideas that run afoul of university        234    00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:05.930    politics and societal norms when tenure        235    00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.660    was created it was mostly protected        236    00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.570    liberals whose ideas ran against it was        237    00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.600    conservative norms today if tenure is        238    00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.880    going to continue it must also protect        239    00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.490    conservatives whose ideas run up against        240    00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:23.000    liberal norms otherwise university        241    00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.070    research and the professor's who conduct        242    00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:27.320    it will lose credibility great        243    00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.750    universities must not become predictably        244    00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.200    partisan and a liberal arts education        245    00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.450    might not must not be an education in        246    00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.850    the art of liberalism the role of        247    00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.890    universities is not to promote an        248    00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.130    ideology it is to by provides scholars        249    00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.800    and students with a neutral forum for        250    00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.720    researching and debating our issues        251    00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.180    without tipping the scales in one        252    00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.350    direction or repressing unpopular views        253    00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:56.540    requiring scholars and commencement        254    00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.120    speakers for that matter to conform to        255    00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.580    certain political standards undermines        256    00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.830    the whole purpose of a university        257    00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:15.990    this spring this spring it has been        258    00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.059    serving to see a number of college        259    00:13:18.059 --> 00:13:20.730    commencement speakers withdraw or have        260    00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.790    the invitations rescinded after protests        261    00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.939    from students and to me shockingly from        262    00:13:26.939 --> 00:13:29.189    senior faculty and administrators who        263    00:13:29.189 --> 00:13:30.179    should know better        264    00:13:30.179 --> 00:13:33.170    it happened at Brandeis Haverford        265    00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.089    Rutgers and Smith and last year had        266    00:13:36.089 --> 00:13:37.709    happened that Swarthmore and Johns        267    00:13:37.709 --> 00:13:40.800    Hopkins I'm sorry to say in each of        268    00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.499    these cases liberals silenced a voice        269    00:13:43.499 --> 00:13:46.369    and they denied an honorary degree to        270    00:13:46.369 --> 00:13:48.959    individuals that they deemed politically        271    00:13:48.959 --> 00:13:52.019    objectionable this is an outrage and we        272    00:13:52.019 --> 00:13:55.399    must not let it continue        273    00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:03.870    if the university thinks twice before        274    00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.210    inviting a commencement speaker because        275    00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:09.180    of his or her politics censorship and        276    00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.420    conformity the mortal M&E enemies of        277    00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.930    freedom went out and sadly it's not just        278    00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.880    commencement season when speakers are        279    00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.820    censorship censored last fall when I was        280    00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.770    still in City Hall our Police        281    00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.210    Commissioner was invited to deliver        282    00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:26.760    deliver a lecture at another Ivy League        283    00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.610    institution but he was unable to do so        284    00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.970    because students shouted him down isn't        285    00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.640    the purpose of a university to skirt to        286    00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.850    stir discussion not silence it what were        287    00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.280    the students afraid of hearing and why        288    00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.200    did administrators not step in to        289    00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.510    prevent the mob from silencing speech        290    00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.450    and did anyone consider that it is        291    00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.330    morally and pedagogically wrong to        292    00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.220    deprive other students the chance to        293    00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.980    hear the speech now I'm sure all of        294    00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.290    today's graduates have read John Stuart        295    00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:01.650    Mill's on Liberty but just let me read a        296    00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.240    short passage from it        297    00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.930    quote the particular evil of silencing        298    00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:10.020    the expression of an opinion is that it        299    00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.840    is robbing the human race posterity as        300    00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.420    well as the existing generation those        301    00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.850    who dissent from the opinion still more        302    00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.910    than those who hold it he continued if        303    00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.520    the opinion is right they are deprived        304    00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.770    of the opportunity of exchanging error        305    00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:29.220    for truth if wrong they lose what is        306    00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.800    almost as great a benefit the clear        307    00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.140    perception and livelier impression of        308    00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.750    youth of truth produced by its collision        309    00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.090    with era now mill would have been        310    00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.130    horrified to learn of university        311    00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.110    students styling the opinions of others        312    00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.600    he would have been even more horrified        313    00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.880    that faculty members were often part of        314    00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.120    the commencement censorship campaigns        315    00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.580    for tenured professors to silent        316    00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.130    speakers who views they disagree with is        317    00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.220    really the height of hypocrisy        318    00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.870    especially when those protests happen in        319    00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.420    Northeast the bastion of self professed        320    00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.890    liberal tolerance        321    00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:15.420    now I'm glad to say that fervid has not        322    00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.960    caved into these commencement challenge        323    00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.690    challenge censorship challenges if it        324    00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.670    had Colorado State Senator Michael        325    00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.890    Johnston would not have had the chance        326    00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:27.480    to address the education school        327    00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.180    yesterday some students called on the        328    00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.800    administration to rescind the invitation        329    00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.980    to Johnson because they opposed some of        330    00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.710    his education policies but to their        331    00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:40.170    great credit president Faust and Dean        332    00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:43.170    Ryan stood firm and as dean Ryan wrote        333    00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.750    to the students quote I have encountered        334    00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.760    many people of good faith who share my        335    00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.450    basic goals but disagree with my views        336    00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.040    when it comes to the question of how        337    00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.010    best to improve education in my view        338    00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:58.820    those differences should be explored        339    00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.490    debated challenged and questions but        340    00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:05.040    they should also be respected and indeed        341    00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.620    celebrated he could not have been more        342    00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.720    correct he could not have provided a        343    00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.699    more valuable final lesson to the class        344    00:17:11.699 --> 00:17:14.660    of 2014        345    00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:24.769    as a former chairman of Johns Hopkins I        346    00:17:24.769 --> 00:17:26.689    strongly believe that a University's        347    00:17:26.689 --> 00:17:29.360    obligation is not to teach students what        348    00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.970    to think but to teach students how to        349    00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.000    think and that requires listening to the        350    00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:35.809    other side        351    00:17:35.809 --> 00:17:38.299    weighing arguments without prejudicing        352    00:17:38.299 --> 00:17:40.340    them and determining whether the other        353    00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.649    side might actually made some fair        354    00:17:42.649 --> 00:17:45.620    points if the faculty fails to do this        355    00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.630    then it is a responsibility of the        356    00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:49.279    administration and the governing body to        357    00:17:49.279 --> 00:17:52.070    step in and make it a priority if they        358    00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.590    do not if students graduate with ears        359    00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.139    and minds closed the university has        360    00:17:57.139 --> 00:18:00.049    failed both the students and society and        361    00:18:00.049 --> 00:18:01.850    if you want to know where that leads        362    00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:06.139    look no further than Washington DC down        363    00:18:06.139 --> 00:18:08.899    in Washington every major question        364    00:18:08.899 --> 00:18:11.269    facing our country involving our        365    00:18:11.269 --> 00:18:14.659    security our economy our environment and        366    00:18:14.659 --> 00:18:17.090    our health is decided yet the two        367    00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:19.460    parties decide those questions not by        368    00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.100    engaging with one another but by trying        369    00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.710    to shout each other down and by trying        370    00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:26.960    to repress and undermine the research        371    00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.350    that counters their ideology the more        372    00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.960    our universities emulate that model the        373    00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.090    worse off we will be as a society and        374    00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.909    let me give you a few examples for        375    00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:40.220    decade Congress has barred the Centers        376    00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.870    for Disease Control from conducting        377    00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.659    studies of gun violence and recently        378    00:18:44.659 --> 00:18:47.000    Congress also placed that prohibition on        379    00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000    the National Institute of Health you        380    00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.010    have to ask yourself what are they        381    00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:55.100    afraid of this year the Senate has        382    00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.049    delayed a vote on President Obama's        383    00:18:57.049 --> 00:18:59.720    nominee for Surgeon General dr. Vivek        384    00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.559    Murthy a Harvard physician because he        385    00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:05.539    had the audacity to say that gun        386    00:19:05.539 --> 00:19:07.730    violence is a public health crisis that        387    00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:12.100    should be tackled the gall of him        388    00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.049    let's get serious when eighty-six        389    00:19:22.049 --> 00:19:24.480    Americans are killed with guns every        390    00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.750    single day and shootings regularly occur        391    00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.399    at our schools and universities        392    00:19:29.399 --> 00:19:31.889    including last week's tragedy at Santa        393    00:19:31.889 --> 00:19:34.230    Barbara it would be almost medical        394    00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:37.769    malpractice to say anything else but in        395    00:19:37.769 --> 00:19:40.169    politics as it is on far too many        396    00:19:40.169 --> 00:19:42.960    college campuses people don't listen to        397    00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.820    facts that run counter to their ideology        398    00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.909    they fear them and nothing is more        399    00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:49.769    frightening to them than scientific        400    00:19:49.769 --> 00:19:53.519    evidence earlier this year the state of        401    00:19:53.519 --> 00:19:55.740    South Carolina adopted new science        402    00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.500    standards for its public schools but the        403    00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.169    state legislature blocked any mention of        404    00:20:01.169 --> 00:20:04.470    natural selection that is like teaching        405    00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.990    economics without mentioning supply and        406    00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.529    demand once again you have to ask what        407    00:20:10.529 --> 00:20:12.720    are they afraid of and the answer of        408    00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.149    course is obvious just as members of        409    00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:17.340    Congress via data that undermines their        410    00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.919    ideological beliefs these state        411    00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:22.350    legislative Fiat scientific evidence        412    00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.510    that undermines their religious beliefs        413    00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:26.970    and if you want proof of that consider        414    00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.669    this an eight-year-old girl in South        415    00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:32.190    Carolina wrote to members of the state        416    00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.769    legislature earlier urging them to make        417    00:20:34.769 --> 00:20:37.470    the woolly mammoth the official state        418    00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.679    fossil legislators thought it was a        419    00:20:40.679 --> 00:20:43.110    great idea because a woolly mammoth        420    00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:45.980    fossil was found in a state way back in        421    00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:50.000    1725 but the state Senate passed a bill        422    00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.620    defining the woolly mammoth as having        423    00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.500    been quote created on the sixth day with        424    00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.899    the beasts of the field unquote you        425    00:20:57.899 --> 00:21:01.179    can't make this stuff up        426    00:21:01.179 --> 00:21:04.749    here in 21st century America the wall        427    00:21:04.749 --> 00:21:06.789    between church and state remains under        428    00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:09.849    attack but it's up to all of us to man        429    00:21:09.849 --> 00:21:14.580    the barricades unfortunately        430    00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.580    unfortunately the same elected officials        431    00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.830    who put ideology and religion over data        432    00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:25.929    and science when it comes to guns and        433    00:21:25.929 --> 00:21:28.330    evolution often the most unwilling to        434    00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.609    accept the scientific data on climate        435    00:21:30.609 --> 00:21:32.859    change now don't get me wrong        436    00:21:32.859 --> 00:21:35.979    scientific skepticism is healthy but        437    00:21:35.979 --> 00:21:37.320    there's a world of difference between        438    00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.729    scientific skepticism that seeks out        439    00:21:39.729 --> 00:21:41.889    more evidence an ideological        440    00:21:41.889 --> 00:21:45.249    stubbornness that shuts it out given the        441    00:21:45.249 --> 00:21:46.899    general attitude of many elected        442    00:21:46.899 --> 00:21:49.239    officials towards science it's no wonder        443    00:21:49.239 --> 00:21:51.429    the federal government has abdicated its        444    00:21:51.429 --> 00:21:53.950    responsibility to invest in scientific        445    00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.589    research much of which occurs at our        446    00:21:56.589 --> 00:21:59.289    universities today federal spending on        447    00:21:59.289 --> 00:22:01.210    research and development as a percentage        448    00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:04.269    of GNP is lower than it has been in more        449    00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:06.879    than 50 years which is allowing the rest        450    00:22:06.879 --> 00:22:08.349    of the world to catch up and even        451    00:22:08.349 --> 00:22:10.690    surpass the US and scientific research        452    00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.909    the federal government is flunking        453    00:22:12.909 --> 00:22:15.309    science just as many state governments        454    00:22:15.309 --> 00:22:17.769    are but we must not become a country        455    00:22:17.769 --> 00:22:20.499    that turns its back on science or on        456    00:22:20.499 --> 00:22:23.259    each other now I get back to the class        457    00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:26.499    of 2014 you graduates must help lead the        458    00:22:26.499 --> 00:22:29.889    way on every issue we must follow the        459    00:22:29.889 --> 00:22:32.289    evidence where it leads and listen to        460    00:22:32.289 --> 00:22:35.469    people where they are if we know don't        461    00:22:35.469 --> 00:22:38.259    do that there if we do that there is no        462    00:22:38.259 --> 00:22:41.289    problem we cannot solve no gridlock we        463    00:22:41.289 --> 00:22:43.929    cannot break no compromise we cannot        464    00:22:43.929 --> 00:22:47.889    broker the more we exchange or embrace a        465    00:22:47.889 --> 00:22:50.619    free exchange of ideas and the more we        466    00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:52.869    accept that political diversity the        467    00:22:52.869 --> 00:22:54.669    healthier we are the stronger our        468    00:22:54.669 --> 00:22:57.789    society will be now I know this has not        469    00:22:57.789 --> 00:22:59.859    been a traditional commencement speech        470    00:22:59.859 --> 00:23:02.649    and in fact it may keep me from passing        471    00:23:02.649 --> 00:23:05.049    a dissertation defense in the humanities        472    00:23:05.049 --> 00:23:06.290    Department        473    00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:09.710    but there is no easy time to say hard        474    00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:12.650    things graduates throughout your lives        475    00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:15.170    do not be afraid of saying what you        476    00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.870    believe is right no matter how unpopular        477    00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:21.140    it may be especially when it comes to        478    00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.080    defending the rights of others stand up        479    00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.090    for the rights of others and in some        480    00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:28.010    ways it's even more important than        481    00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.590    standing up for your own rights because        482    00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:33.320    when people seek to repress freedom for        483    00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.860    some and you may remain silent you are        484    00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:39.920    complicit in that repression and you may        485    00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.370    well become its victim do not be        486    00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:46.760    complicit do not follow the crowd speak        487    00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.430    up and fight back you will take your        488    00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.980    lumps I can assure you of that you will        489    00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.810    lose some friends and make some enemies        490    00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.240    I can sure assure you of that too but        491    00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.210    the arc of history will be on your side        492    00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.870    and our nation will be stronger for it        493    00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:04.820    now all of

      53    00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.640    2014 I imagine we're all feeling some        54    00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.239    mix of anxiety and relief and if you're        55    00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.519    anything like me a little bit of anxiety        56    00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.200    is enough to overwhelm whatever else        57    00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.840    you're        58    00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.840    feeling that anxiety can make you Prett        59    00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.800    prematurely nostalgic for the days when        60    00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.799    your biggest problem was a 5 to S page        61    00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.239    paper also known as a four-page paper        62    00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.840    with wide margins and a really long        63    00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.000    title or when your biggest problem was        64    00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000    that you have too many        65    00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.200    advisors by now each of us has had a        66    00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.400    freshman advisor a peer advising fellow        67    00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.720

concentration advisor and        73    00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.439    for the masochistic a thesis        74    00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.959    advisor I sincerely thank all of my        75    00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.879    advisers        76    00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.159    but I just want to put it out there that        77    00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.200    Luke Skywalker defeated the Empire with        78    00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.120    only one        79    00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:17.280    advisor and he spoke in incoherent        80    00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.520    aphorisms had crazily inconvenient        81    00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.320    office        82    00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.840    hours and never once offered Luke a mini        83    00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.240    Mr goodar        84    00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.479    despite the luxury of too many        85    00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.120    advisors there are some questions on our        86    00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.600    minds right now that no one can answer        87    00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.680    for certain like will the clubs I joined        88    00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.000    be enough to convince my future children        89    00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.479    that I used to be        90    00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.919    cool will my concentration have any        91    00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.039    application in the real        92    00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.880    world it's common at this point to bring        93    00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.639    up folklore and method        94    00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.240    ology but I don't think Celtic studies        95    00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.320    gets the attention it        96    00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.960    deserves most people either don't know        97    00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.240    what that is or think you're pronouncing        98    00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.520    it        99    00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:25.440    wrong and perhaps the scariest question        100    00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.319    of        101    00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:31.199    all did I peak in college        102    00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.600    I think that there are two and only two        103    00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.360    answers to this        104    00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.479    question absolutely not and you know        105    00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.360    probably I'll entertain the you know        106    00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.800    probably answer first we're about to        107    00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.680    enter a scary world where our dumb        108    00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.400    mistakes will be met with a dubious look        109    00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.280    and a wise crack about where we went to        110    00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.919    college at least here if someone someone        111    00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:04.039    says H there's no way you go to Harvard        112    00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:07.440    it's usually a pickup        113    00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:20.800    line if I may speak from my own fears of        114    00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.599    having peaked in college when I first        115    00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:26.000    came to Harvard a part of me just wanted        116    00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.160    to study English and write comedy but        117    00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.280    another part of me wanted to discover        118    00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.560    something new that would become my        119    00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.160    passion like anthropology or conceptual        120    00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.400    art but hopefully Investment        121    00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:48.400    Banking four years later I'm getting a        122    00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.479    degree in English and every Club I        123    00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:53.800    joined was somehow related to comedy        124    00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.599    with the arguable exception of the        125    00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:58.599    Lampoon        126    00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.360    it turns out I can't be        127    00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.319    changed if I may sum up my experience in        128    00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:11.160    a        129    00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.360    metaphor I'm sorry a        130    00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:21.160    simile who says an English degree is        131    00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.479    useless I'm like one of television's        132    00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:27.039    many illustrious Bad        133    00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:30.000    Boys Don Draper        134    00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000    Tony        135    00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.919    Soprano Chuck        136    00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:37.080    Bass Harvard's gened requirements and        137    00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.680    activity fairs are like another        138    00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.639    character who thinks it can change me        139    00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:48.440    but sorry Harvard I can't be        140    00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.599    changed and that's why this day makes me        141    00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:54.680    sad because not only can I no longer        142    00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.720    compare myself to Don        143    00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.560    Draper but I also don't know for certain        144    00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.879    if I'll find another place where I can        145    00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:05.280    be so completely myself and still have        146    00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.919    friends and feel        147    00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:08.879    fulfilled where else will I be        148    00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:11.919    surrounded by so many people just being        149    00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:14.879    their dorky selves and doing what they        150    00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:19.440    love except at a white collar        151    00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.199    prison so maybe it's all downhill from        152    00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:30.639    here        153    00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:32.479    just like it's been downhill for        154    00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:34.760    commencement day speakers since Oprah        155    00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.440    came last        156    00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:45.279    year but I mean        157    00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:48.279    seriously good luck tomorrow former        158    00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:52.279    mayor of something what's his        159    00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.920    face however the one thing I do like        160    00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.839    about        161    00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:04.480    graduation also leads me to believe that        162    00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.680    we didn't all peak in        163    00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.120    college my fellow graduates there's        164    00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.920    probably someone in the class of 2014        165    00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.399    who makes you think well I'm screwed but        166    00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:19.720    that guy is going to be        167    00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.640    amazing well graduation allows you to        168    00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.519    share something with that person and        169    00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:28.800    I'll bet there's someone else who feels        170    00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.519    the same way about you why the person        171    00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:34.920    who looks up to you could even be        172    00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.480    speaking right        173    00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.920    now if your name is Zila        174    00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.600    Chan if you're still worried that you        175    00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.279    might have peaked in college then think        176    00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:51.279    of your favorite Harvard grad could be        177    00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:53.600    JFK could be Natalie        178    00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:00.079    Portman mine hands down is John Adams        179    00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.640    I mean his life probably didn't turn out        180    00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.959    the way he expected when he graduated        181    00:10:06.959 --> 00:10:10.480    but he still became our second        182    00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.040    president you might even say he was the        183    00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.959    Yale of        184    00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.600    presidents he married an incredible lady        185    00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.720    and inspired an entire miniseries        186    00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.320    when I was accepted into Harvard I        187    00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.839    couldn't wait to go to the same school        188    00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:43.160    as our grouchiest Founding        189    00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.600    Father you might even say I came for the        190    00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.720    John Adams and then stayed for the Sam        191    00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.680    Adams yeah but please don't say that my        192    00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.000    parents are in the        193    00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.399    audience my point is the person who made        194    00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:03.720    you excited to come here should also        195    00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.839    make you excited to        196    00:11:05.839 --> 00:11:07.959    leave class of        197    00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:11.600    2014 I'm not saying you can do        198    00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.000    anything as you will discover tomorrow        199    00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.600    you can't look good in a cap and        200    00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.440    gown but at least there's a good chance        201    00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.160    you didn't peak in college        202    00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.880    congratulations to the class of 2014 and        203    00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.250    their amilies        204    00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:37.500    [Applause]

Adventures here and from        21    00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.400    this stage in        22    00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.360    1943 Winston Churchill addressed an        23    00:01:10.360 -->

that he hoped the young        26    00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.240    recruits would come to regard the        27    00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.640    British soldiers and S Sailors they        28    00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.479    would soon fight alongside as their        29    00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.720    brothers in arms and he assured the        30    00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.119    audience that we shall never Tire nor        31    00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.200    weaken but march with you to establish        32    00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.240    the reign of justice and of

needed what best can be done        38    00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.560    what must be        39    00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.240    done here in 1998 Nelson Mandela        40    00:02:05.240 -->

       43    00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.000    facing our globalized world he said is        44    00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.800    to combat and eradicate its        45    00:02:18.800 -->

that among society's        77    00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.360    institutions it is uniquely accountable        78    00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.720    to the past and to the        79

must be        104    00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.039    our Compass to steer by our common        105    00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.560    purpose and our shared commitment what        106    00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.759    does Harvard what do universities owe        107    00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:33.199    the future first first we owe the world        108    00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:36.000    answers Discovery is at the heart of        109    00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.120    what universities do universities engage        110    00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.039    faculty and students across a range of        111    00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.759    disciplines in seeking solutions to        112    00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:48.160    problems that may have seemed        113    00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.440    unsolvable endeavoring to answer        114    00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.360    questions that threaten to elude us the        115    00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.600    scientific research undertaken today at        116    00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.919    Harvard and tomorrow by the students we        117    00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.160    educate        118    00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.960    has a capacity to improve human lives in        119    00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.720    ways virtually unimaginable even a        120    00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.800    generation ago in this past year alone        121    00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.520    Harvard researchers have solved riddles        122    00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.039    related to the treatment of Alzheimer's        123    00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:18.960    the costeffective production of malaria        124    00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.039    vaccine and the origins of the        125    00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:24.400    universe Harvard researchers have        126    00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.840    proposed answers to challenges as varied        127    00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.599    as nuclear proliferation American compe        128    00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:32.520    iveness and governance of the        129    00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.840    internet we must continue to support our        130    00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.639    an Seekers who work at the crossroads of        131    00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:42.639    the theoretical and the applied at the        132

shape our future and enhance our        135    00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:53.880    understanding of the        136    00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:59.680    world second we owe the world questions        137    00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.120    just as questions yield answers answers        138    00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.199    yield        139    00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:07.800    questions human beings May long for        140    00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.960    certainty but as Oliver Wendel Holmes        141    00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.919    put it certainty generally is illusion        142    00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:17.960    and Repose is not the destiny of        143    00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.720    man universities produce knowledge they        144    00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.120    must also produce        145    00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.800    doubt The Pursuit Of Truth is        146    00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.759    restless we ser search for answers not        147    00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:33.240    by following prescribed paths but by        148    00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.120    finding the right questions by answering        149    00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.400    one question with another question by        150    00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.400    nurturing a state of mind that is        151    00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.759    flexible and alert dissatisfied and        152    00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:47.520    imaginative it's what universities are        153    00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.759    designed to        154    00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:52.120    do in an essay in Harvard magazine one        155    00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.879    of today's graduates Chiron Dugan wrote        156    00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:58.280    about seeking what she called an        157    00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.360    education of of        158    00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.680    questions I hope we have indeed given        159    00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.960    her        160    00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.800    that questions are the foundation for        161    00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.800    Progress for ensuring that the world        162    00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.000    transcends where we are now what we know        163    00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.280    now and questions are also the        164    00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.280    foundation for a third obligation that        165    00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.319    we as universities owe the future we owe        166    00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:24.039    the future        167    00:08:24.039 --> 00:08:26.599    meaning universities must nurture the        168    00:08:26.599 --> 00:08:29.120    ability to interpret to make critical        169    00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.680    judgment ments to dare to ask the        170    00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.440    biggest questions the ones that reach        171    00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.719    well beyond the immediate and the        172    00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:39.120    instrumental we must stimulate the        173    00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.919    appetite for        174    00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:43.120    curiosity we find many of these        175    00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.000    questions in the humanities what is good        176    00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.160    what is just how do we know what is true        177    00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.160    but we find them in the Sciences as well        178    00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.720    can there be any question more profound        179    00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.480    more fundamental than to ask about the        180    00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.360    the origins of the        181    00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.040    universe how did we get        182    00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.480    here questions like these can be        183    00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.079    unsettling and they can make        184    00:09:08.079 --> 00:09:10.360    universities unsettling        185    00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.360    places but that too is an essential part        186    00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.880    of what we owe the future the promise to        187    00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.640    combat complacency to challenge the        188    00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.720    present in order to prepare for what is        189    00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.720    to come to shape the present in service        190    00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.959    of an uncertain and yet impatient future        191    00:09:29.959 --> 00:09:32.680    we owe the future answers we owe the        192    00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.040    future questions we owe the future        193    00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.480    meaning the Harvard campaign launched        194    00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.560    last September will help us fulfill        195    00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.839    these obligations and pay our debt to        196    00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:45.120    the Future just as the gifts of previous        197    00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.839    generations anchor us here        198    00:09:47.839 --> 00:09:50.480    today as today's ceremonies so        199    00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.040    powerfully remind us we also owe the        200    00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.680

     44    00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.870    everyone would think it was awesome that        45    00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.310    I was from Florida at least we didn't        46    00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.410    have Instagram for me Harvard was a        47    00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.100    series of firsts my first winter coat we        48    00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.830    didn't need those in Miami my first 10        49    00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.200    page paper they didn't assign those in        50    00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.340    my high school my first C after which my        51    00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.900    proctor told me that she was on the        52    00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.210    admissions committee and I got and I got        53    00:02:45.210 -->

from boarding school I        56    00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.190    thought that was her really troubled        57    00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.150    kids the first person I ever met who        58

00:03:07.110    was Sarah wiglesworth who bore no        61    00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.270    relation at all to the dorm which would        62    00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.800    have been nice to know at that very        63    00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.650    intimidating moment but then I went on        64    00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.900    to meet others Francis Straus James weld        65

graduation my class cheered for the        82    00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.640    PhD students and then booed the business        83    00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.430    school business school seemed like such        84    00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.840    a sellout 18 months later I applied to        85    00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.870    business school it wasn't that I was        86    00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.520    wrong about what I would do decades        87    00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.130    after graduating I had it wrong a year        88    00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.280    and a half later and even if I could        89    00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.720    have predicted I would one day work in        90    00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.460    the private sector I never could have        91    00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.220    predicted Facebook because there was no        92    00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.070    internet and Mark Zuckerberg was an        93    00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.910    elementary school        94    00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:47.000    already wearing his hoodie not locking        95    00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.210    into a path too early gave me an        96    00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.770    opportunity to go into a new and        97    00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.230    life-changing field and for those of you        98    00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.060    who think I owe everything to good luck        99    00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.720    after candidate I got quat 'add what's        100    00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:07.250    that bad there is no straight path from        101    00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.720    your seat today to where you are going        102    00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.270    don't try to draw that line you will not        103    00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.100    just get it wrong you will miss big        104    00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.430    opportunities and I mean big like the        105    00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.800    Internet careers are not ladders those        106    00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.090    days are long gone        107    00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.430    but jungle gyms don't just move up and        108    00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.130    down don't just look up look backwards        109    00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.160    sideways around corners your career and        110

00:05:38.500    white space the path you can't draw        113    00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.210    because therein lies both the surprises        114    00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.380    and the opportunities as you open        115    00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.120    yourself up to possibility the most        116    00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.310    important thing I can tell you today is        117    00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.780    to open yourself up to honesty to        118    00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.840    telling the truth to each other to being        119    00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.660    honest with yourselves and to being        120    00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.500    honest about the world we live in if you        121    00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.060    watch children you will immediately        122    00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.090    notice how honest they are my friend        123    00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.670    Betsy was pregnant and her son where        124    00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.160    their second child son Sam was five he        125    00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.750    wanted to know where the baby was in her        126    00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.420    body so he asked mommy are the baby's        127    00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.480    arms in your arms and she said no no Sam        128    00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.740    babies in my tummy pull baby mom are the        129    00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.120    baby's legs in your legs no Sam hold        130    00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.960    babies in my tummy then mommy what's        131    00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.040    growing in your butt        132    00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.760    as adults we are almost never dishonest        133    00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.100    and that can be a very good thing when I        134    00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.990    was pregnant with our first child I        135    00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.790    asked my husband Dave if my butt was        136    00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.220    getting big at first he didn't answer        137    00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.440    but I pressed so he said yeah a little        138    00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.150    for years my sister-in-law said about        139    00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.920    him what people will now say about you        140    00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.510    for the rest of your life when you do        141    00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.480    something dumb and that guy went to        142    00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:13.780    Harvard hearing the truth at different        143    00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.850    times along the way would have helped me        144    00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.280    I would not have admitted it easily when        145    00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.680    I sat where you sit but when I graduated        146    00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.960    I was much more worried about my love        147    00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.600    life than my career I thought I only had        148    00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.700    a few years very limited time to find        149    00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.810    one of the good guys        150    00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.480    before he was too or before they were        151    00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.960    all taken or I got too old so I moved to        152    00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.780    DC I met a good guy and I got married at        153    00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.280    the nearly decrepid age of 24 I married        154    00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.200    a wonderful man but I had no business        155    00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.120    making that kind of commitment I didn't        156    00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:51.220    know who I was or who I wanted to be my        157    00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.900    marriage fell apart within a year        158    00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.270    something that was really embarrassing        159    00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.669    and painful at the time and it did not        160    00:07:57.669 --> 00:07:59.650    help that so many friends came up to me        161    00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.840    and said I never knew that never thought        162    00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.790    that was going to work or I knew you two        163    00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.850    weren't right for each other no one had        164    00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.919    managed to say anything like that to me        165    00:08:08.919 --> 00:08:11.560    before I marched down an aisle when it        166    00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.100    would have been far more useful and as I        167    00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.750    lived through those painful months of        168    00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.640    separation and divorce boy did I wish        169    00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.880    they had and boy did I wish I had asked        170    00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.419    them at the same time in my professional        171    00:08:25.419 --> 00:08:27.880    life someone did speak up my first boss        172    00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.590    out of college was Lant Pritchett an        173    00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.390    economist who teaches at the Kennedy        174    00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.060    School who's here with us today        175    00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.320    after I deferred law school for the        176    00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.450    second time Lance at me down and said I        177    00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.919    don't think you should go to law school        178    00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.260    at all I don't think you want to go to        179    00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.360    law school I think you think you should        180    00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.920    because you told your parents you would        181    00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.650    many years ago he noted that he had        182    00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.480    never once heard me talk about the law        183    00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.320    with any        184    00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.760    test I know how hard it can be to be        185    00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.130    honest with each other even your closest        186    00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.690    friends even when they're about to make        187    00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.420    serious mistakes but I bet sitting here        188    00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.060    today you know your closest friends        189    00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.700    strengths weaknesses what cliff they        190    00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.010    might drive off and I bet for the most        191    00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:12.580    part you've never told them and they've        192    00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:17.110    never asked ask them ask them for the        193    00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.660    truth because it will help you and when        194    00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.150    they answer honestly know that that's        195    00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:26.050    what makes them real friends asking for        196    00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:27.880    feedback is a really important habit to        197    00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.760    get into as you leave the structure of        198    00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.740    the school calendar and exams and grades        199    00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.290    behind on many jobs if you want to know        200    00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:36.880    how you're doing you're going to have to        201    00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.560    ask and then you're going to have to        202    00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.140    listen without getting defensive take it        203    00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.910    from me listening to criticism is never        204    00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.610    fun but it's the only way we can improve        205    00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:49.180    a few years ago Mark Zuckerberg decided        206    00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.670    he wanted to learn Chinese and in order        207    00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.710    to practice he started trying to have        208    00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.540    work meetings with some of our Facebook        209    00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.940    colleagues who were native speakers now        210    00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.410    you would think his very limited        211    00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.300    language skills would keep these        212    00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.390    conversations from being useful one day        213    00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.490    he asked a woman who was there how it        214    00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.040    was going how did she like Facebook she        215    00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.360    answered with a long and pretty        216    00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.760    complicated sentence so he said you know        217    00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.830    simpler please she spoke again simpler        218    00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.230    please this went back and forth a couple        219    00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.420    of times so she has blurted out in        220    00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:29.110    frustration my manager is bad that he        221    00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:33.180    understood so often the truth is        222    00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.920    sacrificed to conflict avoidance or by        223    00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.140    the time we speak the truth we've used        224    00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.750    so many caveats and preambles that the        225    00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.570    message totally gets lost so as you ask        226    00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.070    each other for the truth and other        227    00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.590    people can you elicit it in simple and        228    00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.960    clear language and when you speak your        229    00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.510    truth can you use simple and clear        230    00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.720    language        231    00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.960    as hard as it is to be honest with other        232    00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.540    people it can be even more difficult to        233    00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.510    be honest with ourselves for years after        234    00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.610    I had children I would say pretty often        235    00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:12.790    I don't feel guilty working even when no        236    00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:15.190    one asked someone might say Cheryl has        237    00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:16.960    your day today and I would say great I        238    00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.160    don't feel guilty working or do I need a        239    00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:21.880    sweater        240    00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.090    yes it's unpredictably freezing and I        241    00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:28.300    don't feel guilty working I was kind of        242    00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:32.140    like a parrot with issues then one day        243    00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.820    on the treadmill I was reading this        244    00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.070    article in sociology journal about how        245    00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.690    people don't start out lying to other        246    00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.280    people they start out lying to        247    00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.680    themselves and the things we repeat most        248    00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.740    frequently are often those lies so his        249    00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.780    sweat was pouring down my face I started        250    00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.310    wondering well what do I repeat pretty        251    00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:51.520    frequently and I realized I felt guilty        252    00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.550    working I then did a lot of research and        253    00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.130    I spent an entire year with my dear        254    00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.050    friend Nelson evil writing a book        255    00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.910    talking about how I was thinking and        256    00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.000    feeling and I'm so grateful that so many        257    00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.690    women around the world connected to it        258    00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.460    my book of course was called Fifty        259    00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.910    Shades of Grey        260    00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.730    I can see a lot of you connected to it        261    00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.150    as well        262    00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.060    we have even more work to do in being        263    00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.120    honest about the world we live in we        264    00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.040    don't always see the hard truths and        265    00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.930    once we see them we don't always have        266    00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.450    the courage to speak out when my        267    00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.700    classmates and I were in college we        268    00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:34.779    thought the fight for gender equality        269    00:12:34.779 --> 00:12:38.589    was one it was over sure most of the        270    00:12:38.589 --> 00:12:40.930    leaders in every industry were men but        271    00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.310    we thought changing that was just a        272    00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.310    matter of time Lamont library right over        273    00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.250    there one generation before us didn't        274    00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.410    let women through its doors but by the        275    00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.880    time we sat in your seats        276    00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.830    everything was equal Harvard and        277    00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.650    Radcliffe was fully integrated we didn't        278    00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.600    need feminism because we were already        279    00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:05.680    equals we were wrong I was wrong the        280    00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.470    world was not equal then and it is not        281    00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:12.820    equal now I think nowadays we don't just        282    00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.950    hide ourselves from the hard truths and        283    00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.740    shut our eyes to the inequities what we        284    00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.170    suffer from the tyranny of low        285    00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.060    expectations in the last election cycle        286    00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.940    in the United States women won 20% of        287    00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.800    the Senate seats and all the headlines        288    00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.900    kept screaming up women take over the        289    00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.450    Senate women take over the Senate I felt        290    00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:32.920    like screaming back wait a minute        291    00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.980    everyone 50% of the population getting        292    00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.120    20% of the seats that's not a takeover        293    00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:44.050    that's an embarrassment just a few        294    00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:47.320    months ago this year a very well        295    00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.790    respected and well known business        296    00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.460    executive in Silicon Valley invited me        297    00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.860    to give a speech to his club on social        298    00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.170    media I've been to this club a few        299    00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.120    months before when I had been invited        300    00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.100    for a friend's birthday it was a        301    00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.959    beautiful building and I was wandering        302    00:14:01.959 --> 00:14:03.940    around looking at it looking for the        303    00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.650    women's room when a staff member        304    00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.380    informed me very firmly that the ladies        305    00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.420    room was over there and I should be sure        306    00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.279    not to go upstairs because women are        307    00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:15.520    never allowed in this building I didn't        308    00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.470    realize I was in an all-male club until        309    00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.870    that minute I spent the rest of the        310    00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.670    night wondering what I was doing there        311    00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.160    wondering what everyone        312    00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.199    was doing there wondering if any of my        313    00:14:25.199 --> 00:14:27.660    friends in San Francisco would invite me        314    00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.990    to to a party at a club that didn't        315    00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:34.129    allow blacks or Jews or Asians or gays        316    00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:36.629    being invited to give a business speech        317    00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:38.220    at this club hit me is even more        318    00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.720    egregious because you couldn't claim        319    00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.639    that it was only social business wasn't        320    00:14:41.639 --> 00:14:44.629    done there my first thought was really        321    00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:48.269    really a year after leaned in this dude        322    00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:50.730    thought it was a good idea to invite me        323    00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:53.040    to give a speech to his literal all boys        324    00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.540    club and he wasn't alone there was an        325    00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.550    entire committee of well-respected        326    00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.879    businessmen who joined him in issuing        327    00:15:02.879 --> 00:15:06.149    this kind invitation to paraphrase        328    00:15:06.149 --> 00:15:08.579    Groucho Marx and don't worry I won't try        329    00:15:08.579 --> 00:15:11.850    to do the voice I don't want to speak in        330    00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:13.819    any club that won't have me as a member        331    00:15:13.819 --> 00:15:16.860    so I said no and I did it in a way I        332    00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.600    probably wouldn't have even five years        333    00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.910    before I wrote a long and passionate        334    00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.250    email arguing that they should change        335    00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:26.610    their policies they thanked me for my        336    00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:30.000    prompt response and wrote that perhaps        337    00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.259    things will eventually change our        338    00:15:33.259 --> 00:15:38.009    expectations are too low eventually        339    00:15:38.009 --> 00:15:42.350    needs to become immediately        340    00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.710    we need to see the truth and speak the        341    00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.810    truth we tolerate discrimination and we        342    00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:58.570    pretend that opportunity is equal yes we        343    00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:00.250    elected an african-american president        344    00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.790    but racism is pervasive still yes there        345    00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:06.210    are women who run fortune 500 companies        346    00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.850    5% to be precise but our road there is        347    00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.520    still paved with words like pushy and        348    00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.370    bossy while our male peers are leaders        349    00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.910    and results-focused        350    00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.990    african-american women have to prove        351    00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:22.180    that they're not angry Latinas risk        352    00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:26.050    being branded at fiery hot Headz a group        353    00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:27.760    of Asian American women and

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.710    Harvard has a woman president and in two        357    00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.720    years the United States may have a woman        358    00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:46.900    president but in order to get there        359    00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.460    Hillary Clinton is gonna have to        360    00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.960    overcome two very real obstacles unknown        361    00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.490    and often understood gender bias and        362    00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:04.630    even worse a degree from Yale you can

00:17:27.630    they are not someone else's problem        373    00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.430    gender and quality harms men along with        374    00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.190    women racism hurts whites along with        375    00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.350    minorities and the lack of equal        376    00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.380    opportunity keeps all of us from from        377    00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.910    fulfilling our true potential        378    00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.550    so as you graduate today I want to put        379    00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.980

them and when        382    00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:56.050    you see them to address them the first        383    00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:58.660    time I spoke out about what it was like        384    00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.000    to be a woman in the workforce was less        385    00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:01.309    than        386    00:18:01.309 --> 00:18:04.639    five years ago that means that for 18        387    00:18:04.639 --> 00:18:07.129    years from where you sit to where I        388    00:18:07.129 --> 00:18:07.909    stand        389    00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:11.870    my silence implied that everything was        390    00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:16.009    okay you can do better than I did        391    00:18:16.009 --> 00:18:20.720    and I mean that so sincerely at the

   00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.380    well for two centuries ago        2    00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.309    a man came to Harvard uncertain of his        3    00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.690    future and his fate he had received an        4    00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.200    offer he could not refuse and though he        5    00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.010    felt unworthy he wrote to his family        6    00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.820    that he believed a kind of destiny was        7    00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.149    driving him to Cambridge        8    00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.360    he spent his first night right here        9    00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.460    sleeping in Harvard Yard and awoke the        10    00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.700    next morning July 3rd 1775 to take        11    00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.100    command of the troops of the United        12    00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.120    Provinces of North America the fledgling        13    00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.210    Continental Army George Washington had a        14    00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.730    unique Harvard application process his        15    00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.040    admissions committee was the Second        16    00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.700    Continental Congress and his experience        17    00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.130    here at Harvard would not only define        18    00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.270    the final 24 years of his life but the        19    00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.130    startup he launched here        20    00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.930    would go on to change the course of        21    00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.950    human history just across the street        22    00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.790    under a tree is a group of monuments one        23    00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.490    displaying rows of strapping uniformed        24    00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.590    soldiers welcoming Washington to        25    00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.409    Cambridge and another says under this        26    00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.659    tree Washington first took command of        27    00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.420    the American army July 3rd 1775 and I've        28    00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.220    always felt a sense of awe for this        29    00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.819    world-changing spot but then I did some        30    00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:56.659    research and I found something less        31    00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.700    romantic Washington's Harvard welcome        32    00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.360    weekend was less than grant and his        33    00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.310    first year at Harvard was downright        34    00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.080    awful on Sunday July 2nd he rode into a        35    00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.670    deserted looking town soaking wet and        36    00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.260    half sick        37    00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.840    in fact the welcome reception was        38    00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.090    canceled due to rain and several        39    00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.910    soldiers wrote in their journals that        40    00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.670    nothing new or remarkable happened on        41    00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.470    July 3rd imagine if we could go back in        42    00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.030    time to this very spot that day in 1775        43    00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.430    we would be sitting in a very different        44    00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.670    Harvard Yard a field full of makeshift        45    00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.930    tents on uniformed soldiers and a rough        46    00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.630    defense position in place of lamont        47    00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.230    library one historian described this        48    00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.200    scene like Woodstock New York 1969 a        49    00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.120    volunteer undisciplined under-equipped        50    00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.140    militia of farmers and merchants this        51    00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.590    was the group about half the size of the        52    00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.140    crowd we've assembled this morning this        53    00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.359    was the group that Washington came to        54    00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.150    lead against the most powerful military        55    00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.880    force on earth but Washington took what        56    00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.709    was offered to him here at Harvard and        57    00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.440    he made the most of it        58    00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.820    and I'm not just talking about the brass        59    00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.829    doorknobs or the metal roof he took off        60    00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.209    Harvard Hall to melt into musket balls        61    00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.299    which they did take but he took ideas        62    00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.030    that existed only as words and writings        63    00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.159    and he turned them into reality for        64    00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:54.959    millions and generations to come in less        65    00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.329    than a year later after pushing the        66    00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.280    British out of Boston Washington        67    00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.189    received an honorary degree from this        68    00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:03.810    fine institution        69    00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.359    his first academic degree and like many        70    00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.239    Harvard graduates he went on to take a        71    00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.879    prominent position in New York City        72    00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:26.340    and it almost killed him well the        73    00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.009    British nearly killed him and we almost        74    00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.520    lost the entire war in fact the next        75    00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.370    seven years of the war effort would        76    00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.130    become the most challenging years of his        77    00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:45.030    life today you will receive a piece of        78    00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.110    paper representing your short time here        79    00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.760    at Harvard your successes your failures        80    00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.130    your all-night study sessions your        81    00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.090    lessons        82    00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.300    your first a-minus        83    00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.470    and the friendships that will last a        84    00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.320    lifetime        85    00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.820    through these experiences you've        86    00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.889    developed practiced and honed the skills        87    00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:20.990    you need but sitting here today facing        88    00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.199    an uncertain future let alone the        89    00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.180    examples of Mayors and entrepreneurs        90    00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.940    Nobel Prize winners presidents and a        91    00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:39.080    queen the queen of Seoul sitting here        92    00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.910    today facing a lot of uncertainty and a        93    00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:41.930    lot of high bars        94    00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.810    it might seem difficult to connect the        95    00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.450    dots to your destiny but have faith        96    00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.040    because there is a kind of destiny        97    00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.010    waiting to be fulfilled that is uniquely        98    00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.479    yours you see Washington had to go        99    00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:01.070    through a difficult transformation        100    00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.710    process even after receiving his Harvard        101    00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.639    degree to turn his kind of destiny into        102    00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.320    a real force that could change history        103    00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.410    and he came to discover he could not do        104    00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.580    it alone the individuals and incidents        105    00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.820    that faced him over the next seven years        106    00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.700    whittled carved and sculpted him into        107    00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.770    the monumental man we remember today and        108    00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.139    in the end the army he thought he was        109    00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:37.039    coming to transform ended up being the        110    00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:42.800    force that transformed him and while you        111    00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.210    may not realize it yet        112    00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.400    some of the biggest lessons you'll take        113    00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.039    with you from this experience have come        114    00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:51.349    from the people who've been learning        115    00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:55.820    right beside you they've challenged you        116    00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.130    they pushed you they've inspired you        117    00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.340    they've supported you and ultimately        118    00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.060    helped reveal a better version of        119    00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:10.460    yourself you see the question is not        120    00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.630    only what you will take with you        121    00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:19.100    but who you will take with you on July        122    00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:27.560    4th 1776 Washington issued his first        123    00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.570    general orders to the Troops from right        124    00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.330    here in Harvard Yard declaring that all        125    00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.850    distinctions of colonies should be laid        126    00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.930    aside so that one spirit may animate the        127    00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.520    whole and the only contest being who        128    00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.460    shall render on this great and trying        129    00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.170    occasion the most essential service to        130    00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.750    this great and common cause in which we        131    00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:58.340    are all engaged and just as Washington        132    00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.530    came here to Harvard to unite the 13        133    00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.290    colonies we've come together this        134    00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.360    morning to celebrate the unity and        135    00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.980    diversity of our thirteen schools        136    00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.480    whether you are driven to solve the        137

Business School community good        7    00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.610    afternoon and welcome one of the hazards        8    00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.290    of being Dean is that a few days before        9    00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.010    graduation you become totally keen        10    00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.650    weather water so all I've been doing for        11    00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.809    this whole week is watch the weather and        12    00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.540    you can imagine my horror on Tuesday        13    00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.610    evening when I learned that there was        14    00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.850    gonna be flash floods could you not that        15    00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.739    was the better forecast on Tuesday        16    00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.309    evening on Wednesday we learned that we        17    00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.229    were gonna have the coldest day that        18    00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:07.689    Boston has ever seen in May but every        19    00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:09.520    graduating class has some quality dust        20    00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.770    that distinguishes it and so we should        21    00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.750    not be surprised that this is what we        22    00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.650    expected from the class of 2014 because        23    00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.810    when they arrived in our campus in 2012        24    00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.619    just a few weeks later it was hurricane        25    00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.939    sandy a month later we had a campus-wide        26    00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.979    power outage in February of 2013 we had        27    00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.619    Blizzard Nimmo mountains of snow all        28    00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.319    over this campus and as if that was not        29    00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.999    enough        30    00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.259    later that year we experienced a flood        31    00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.049    in a residence hall and fire and the SFB        32    00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.590    apartments        33    00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.110    we lived through the Boston Marathon        34    00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.510    bombings and the lockdown and manhunt        35    00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.210    that followed you shared a deep sadness        36    00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.340    over the victims including the daughter        37    00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.509    of a her business school staff member        38    00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.479    through it all the class of 2014        39    00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.290    exhibited patience and grace you thought        40    00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.259    of others above yourselves it is this        41    00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.810    compassion that will always mark the        42    00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.870    class of 2014 and we at Harvard Business        43    00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.290    School        44    00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.420    are grateful for how you chose to shine        45    00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.989    in the face of this adversity so it's        46    00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.480    only fitting that as we gather for        47

graduate today with a rich        50    00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.780    set of memories of cases and core calls        51    00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.060    you nailed field experiences you enjoyed        52    00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.150    friends you laughed or cried with today        53    00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.400    as you leave your campus I would like to        54    00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.200    offer a last set of thoughts that I hope        55    00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.140    you will remember from Casey Gerald's        56    00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.970    remarkable speech yesterday        57    00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.170    I know that you already know the four PS        58    00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.620    the Five Forces and Six Sigma but I'm        59    00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.239    gonna keep it simpler I'm gonna talk to        60    00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.049    you today about the three T's truth        61    00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.030    trust and thankfulness on the Diploma        62    00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.500    you will receive today you will find a        63    00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.640    seal with the model of Harvard        64    00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.019    University which reads Veritas the Latin        65    00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.769    word for truth in Roman mythology        66    00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.510    Veritas is the goddess of truth the        67    00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.489    daughter of Saturn and the mother of        68    00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.019    virtue legend has it that Veritas hid in        69    00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.019    the bottom of a holy well which is what        70    00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.430    makes truth so elusive you've learned        71    00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.409    that yourself as you have searched for        72    00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.750    the truth in the nearly 500 cases you've        73    00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.420    studied you have learned to test these        74    00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.799    truths in your case discussions        75    00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.379    discussions that very often lead you to        76    00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.959    reconsider the positions you held true        77    00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.989    when you walked into the classroom this        78    00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.209    magical process are forcing you to        79    00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.400    defend your positions and at times        80    00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.079    watching them crumble in the face of        81    00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.180    questions you haven't considered is the        82    00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.220    real power of the pedagogy that makes        83    00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.349    horror Business School such a special        84    00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:22.740    place I hope it has taught you to keep        85    00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.830    asking hard questions considering new        86    00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.169    perspectives listening to the views of        87    00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.330    others and searching for the underlying        88    00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.120    truth in whatever challenges you may        89    00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.750    face another sense in which you must        90    00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.870    doggedly pursue the truth is to be true        91    00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.080    to yourself which includes finding the        92    00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.260    path in your life that helps you realize        93    00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.190    your highest purpose this too can be        94    00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.650    elusive as I have experienced in my own        95    00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.470    life as a student in India I studied        96    00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.070    Chemical Engineering I was okay at it        97    00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.780    but the truth was that I was never going        98    00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.409    to be great at it        99    00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:03.510    and I realized it would never be my        100    00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.510    calling when I came to MIT as a graduate        101    00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.159    student I began working on a PhD in        102    00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.460    finance at the time mi t--'s finance        103    00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.470    professors were winning Nobel Prizes and        104    00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.570    I truly felt fortunate to be in the        105    00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.289    midst of such remarkable and brilliant        106    00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.889    people yet again I came to the painful        107    00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.020    recognition that although I was good at        108    00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.289    finance the truth was I was unlikely to        109    00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:28.129    be great at that        110    00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.069    either so I switched to the study of        111    00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:34.639    leadership there I finally found a path        112    00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:36.889    that enabled me to pursue my true        113    00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.629    calling so search for your true calling        114    00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:45.399    however painful the path to it might be        115    00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:49.569    truth is elusive truth is painful        116    00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:52.789    searching for the truth is hard but so        117    00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.099    is speaking the truth and hearing the        118    00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:57.949    truth the narrative of every business        119    00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:00.289    candle think of Enron as a        120    00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:03.259    representative case usually has someone        121    00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:04.699    who recognized the truth of what was        122    00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:08.839    happening and tried to stop it speaking        123    00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:12.589    these truths takes courage entails risks        124    00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:15.589    and can result in frustration because        125    00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:20.180    people in power don't always listen yet        126    00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.819    you must always have the courage to        127    00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:26.449    speak the truth indeed as you progress        128    00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:27.769    through your career into leadership        129    00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:30.740    positions you must remain keenly aware        130    00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.469    of how difficult it can be for truths to        131    00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:35.899    trickle up in an organization as a        132    00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:38.300    leader is your job to try and create a        133    00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.819    safe and open culture where people feel        134    00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:42.800    comfortable delivering bad news up the        135    00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.169    chain of command and where it's okay to        136    00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:49.849    speak truth to power the second tea I        137    00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:53.229    ask you to reflect on today is trust        138    00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:55.819    Trust has a deep relationship with truth        139    00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:57.889    it's an emotional bond that develops        140    00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:00.740    between people or institutions who have        141    00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.509    grown accustomed to observing each other        142    00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:05.469    act in truthful and appropriate ways        143    00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:07.849    Trust is one of the greatest assets you        144    00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:09.979    can possess as an individual or as a        145    00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:13.009    business when I think about the quality        146    00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:15.469    of trust I think about two important        147    00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:18.830    lessons I learned from my father one        148    00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.289    about personal trust and one about the        149    00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:22.789    trust that exists between business and        150    00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:24.879    society        151    00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:27.050    as the CEO of a company in India my        152    00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.460    father negotiated hundreds of        153    00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.460    partnerships and deals over his career        154    00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.529    when I would talk to him of his work he        155    00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:35.449    but very often referred to his level of        156    00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:38.529    trust in the other party he might say        157    00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:42.110    we've signed an airtight contract but I        158    00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.849    don't fully trust the person I'm dealing        159    00:07:43.849 --> 00:07:45.740    with so I expect there will still be        160    00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.180    problems or he'd say this person's word        161    00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.909    is good even though our contractual        162    00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:54.559    terms aren't as favorable as I would        163    00:07:54.559 --> 00:07:57.999    have liked this should work out well I        164    00:07:57.999 --> 00:08:00.319    think of my father's impressions of his        165    00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:02.960    partners as a reminder that many of our        166    00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.479    best professional relationships will be        167    00:08:05.479 --> 00:08:07.849    based on an assessment of the trust that        168    00:08:07.849 --> 00:08:09.860    you place in others and that may be far        169    00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.899    more important than the language of        170    00:08:11.899 --> 00:08:14.509    contracts as you move through your        171    00:08:14.509 --> 00:08:17.029    career you should aspire to build a        172    00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:20.379    reputation for being trustworthy I        173    00:08:20.379 --> 00:08:22.189    promise you it will be your best        174    00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:24.860    investment as it will pay rich dividends        175    00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.569    all your life when we think of trust we        176    00:08:29.569 --> 00:08:30.469    should not only think about        177    00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:32.959    relationships between people but also        178    00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:37.310    between institutions as we stand here        179    00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:39.139    today in nearly five years after the        180    00:08:39.139 --> 00:08:41.990    great financial crisis the relationship        181    00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.089    between business and society is one in        182    00:08:44.089 --> 00:08:46.880    which still in which trust still seems        183    00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.839    to be alarmingly low there was a time        184    00:08:50.839 --> 00:08:53.000    when people saw businesses as engines        185    00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.319    that propel propel society's prosperity        186    00:08:56.319 --> 00:09:00.440    but today too many people view business        187    00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.649    leaders with mistrust this is one of the        188    00:09:03.649 --> 00:09:06.440    great problems of our era one that I        189    00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.199    hope your generation will and must        190    00:09:09.199 --> 00:09:12.440    address I find this shift in public        191    00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.209    attitude towards business particularly        192    00:09:14.209 --> 00:09:17.149    upsetting because the second enduring        193    00:09:17.149 --> 00:09:18.680    lesson I learned from my father was the        194    00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.569    power of business to improve people's        195    00:09:20.569 --> 00:09:24.380    lives my father grew up in a village in        196    00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.839    India with no electricity he had to read        197    00:09:26.839 --> 00:09:29.779    by candle lights with no fans or air        198    00:09:29.779 --> 00:09:30.940    conditioning        199    00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.500    in a house where temperatures routinely        200    00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.330    reached 110 degrees during the summer        201    00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.070    when he became CEO he ran a company that        202    00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.050    electrified India and while he certainly        203    00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:42.580    took an interest in its profits and        204    00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.280    losses he was driven by the sense that        205    00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.020    his company was making customers lives        206    00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.090    better        207    00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.670    after all he knew what it was like to        208    00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:54.330    live without electricity        209    00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.230    billions of people in the world still        210    00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.710    live without electricity        211    00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.450    my father's example gave me the palpable        212    00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.150    sense that businesses have a unique        213    00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.470    capacity to make the world a better        214    00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.860    place and a sense of purpose that has        215    00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.900    inspired me to devote my life to        216    00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:15.130    educating business leaders so as you        217    00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.950    pursue your own goals I hope you will        218    00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.770    behave in a way that not only leads to        219    00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:25.090    others placing personal trust in you but        220    00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:26.860    that you also act in a way that rebuilds        221    00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.970    trust between business and society the        222    00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.370    world needs more trust and businesses        223    00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.610    and the leaders because there is no more        224    00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:38.680    powerful force to help solve societal        225    00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.200    problems and to enable billions of        226    00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.600    people to live more prosperous lives        227    00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.690    finally the last tea        228    00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.090    I would like to urge all of you to        229    00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:58.010    reflect on and display thankfulness        230    00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:00.660    those of us who are gathered here today        231    00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.500    are enormous ly blessed and our good        232    00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.360    fortune can create the risk of        233    00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.100    distancing us from people who are less        234    00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.160    fortunate this can be a special problem        235    00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.400    for people in leadership roles remaining        236    00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.290    mindful of our blessings and showing        237    00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.870    thanks for them is the difference        238    00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.500    between being experienced as entitled        239    00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.760    versus being experienced as a true        240    00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.710    leader expressing thankfulness also        241    00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.350    increases your own happiness        242    00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.860    thankfulness creates a virtuous circle        243    00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.650    the more you express it the more reasons        244    00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:41.340    you have to express it I have        245    00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.960    experienced this virtuous circle in my        246    00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.840    own life I have two daughters who are        247    00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:51.210    now 19 and 17 at this age they no longer        248    00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.020    let me read them bedside bedtime stories        249    00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.310    indeed I can scarcely get them to talk        250    00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.280    to me in full sentences but for many        251    00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.200    years when they were younger there was a        252    00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.200    daily ritual I enjoyed very much each        253    00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.730    evening just before my children went to        254    00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:08.940    sleep I would ask them to say three        255    00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.240    thank-yous the three thank-yous meant        256    00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.620    that each child had to name three things        257    00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.160    she was grateful for that day it was        258    00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.270    interesting to hear what they would say        259    00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.640    often they'd start with obvious answers        260    00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.380    I'm grateful for my dad reading me a        261    00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.270    book tonight or I'm grateful for my        262    00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.040    family        263    00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.210    but by the time they got to their third        264    00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.740    thank you they'd start straining to        265    00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.870    think of something and those third        266    00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.480    thank-yous could be revealing which        267    00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.920    teachers were they thankful for which        268    00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.170    friendships that they truly value how        269    00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:38.820    often did they mention privileges they        270    00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.870    had that others didn't when I began        271    00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.760    doing this exercise with my daughter's I        272    00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.470    also began doing it for myself        273    00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.170    and even though my daughters have now        274    00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:49.950    I've grown it        275    00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:53.310    I still do it every night just before I        276    00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.740    go to sleep I think about three specific        277    00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:59.040    things I'm grateful for I feel pretty        278    00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.740    lucky most days        279    00:13:00.740 -->

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.400    get lost in the        31    00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.159    fry photographs are everywhere with the        32    00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.439    rise of Instagram

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.320    have endless opportunities to Capture        36    00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.520    Moments and freeze them        37    00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.840    forever we take pictures of almost        38    00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.159    everything we do this so much that we        39    00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.520    don't think twice about it and might not        40    00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.439    even realize the significance of what        41    00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:49.240    we're        42    00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.840    capturing years from now we will have        43    00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.159    the ability to look back on our College        44    00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.799    days and have an array of memories to        45    00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.920    focus on never having to lose a flash of        46    00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.640    happiness as we grow more distant from        47    00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.880    Harvard but what about the memories that        48    00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.319    we don't capture on film the times when        49    00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.040    unexpected challenges stop us in our        50    00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.440    tracks these are the moments when        51    00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.800    snapping a selfie is the furthest        52    00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.160    thought from our        53    00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.560    minds think of all the tough times that        54    00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.160    you faced or the obstacles you've helped        55    00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.959    a friend overcome and how that's        56    00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.800    affected you as a person think about        57    00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.640    surprising opportuni ities that came        58    00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.840    your way and caused you to choose a        59    00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.760    different path than you had        60    00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.040    predicted the truth is when when when we        61    00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.159    experience something that changes us        62    00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.640    forever whether it is good or bad we        63    00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.879    don't use an iPhone to save it we        64    00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.319    remember these moments forever without        65    00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.800    the help of a lens they can't be        66    00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.280    captured in a picture no words can        67    00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.440    easily describe them and yet they Define        68    00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.760    our        69    00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.360    self-portrait        70    00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.920    when we first arrived on campus we were        71    00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.920    filled with the frenzy and excitement of        72    00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.360    early freshman year we had the        73    00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.680    opportunity to entirely reinvent        74    00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.080    ourselves starting fresh in a place        75    00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.879    where no one had prior impressions of us        76    00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.319    it was an adventurous turn on the camera        77    00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.840    type of experience when we pictured the        78    00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.239    story of our new lives and the path that        79    00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.959    we would travel on for the next four        80    00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.360    years now imagine that you could read a        81    00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.159    letter written by that wide guide        82    00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.400    freshman yourself about who you were and        83    00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.000    what you wanted to        84    00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.640    become what would be your reaction        85    00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.760    today with those hopes and beliefs map        86    00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.280    onto who you have become as an        87    00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.280    individual for all of us our college        88    00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.280    experience and even our identities did        89    00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.200    not unfold in exactly the way we        90    00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.680    imagined we have since migrated from        91    00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.040    that first mold that we made but the        92    00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.000    changes we've experienced have made us        93    00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.560    into strong        94    00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.680    more mature and more resilient        95    00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.680    individuals the event that has changed        96    00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.439    me the most crashed down on me in the        97    00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.400    spring of my freshman year as a varsity        98    00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.680    water poolo player a double hip injury        99    00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.840    assaulted my body and left me unable to        100    00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.040    walk within        101    00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.799    days the injury resulted in two        102    00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.800    extensive surgeries and over 6 months on        103    00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.800    crutches for more than two years I could        104    00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.600    not sit stand or walk        105    00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.880    liberally not only could I not play        106    00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.560    sports I couldn't navigate campus go to        107    00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.919    class or live the normal life of a        108    00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.680    college student I took one semester of        109    00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.160    final exams lying down in a bed in UHS        110    00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.320    and another semester of finals standing        111    00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.960    and writing at a Podium while the        112    00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.039    Proctor sat at the desks because I could        113    00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.400    not sit I was constantly in pain but as        114    00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.000    our challenges often do this time of        115    00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.360    Darkness showed me light and laughter in        116    00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.680    places I never expected an endearing new        117    00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.039    nickname crutchy that I heard more often        118    00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.800    than my real name and a pair of crutches        119    00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.240    that I covered in zebra tape helped give        120    00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.400    me a boost when moving at a snail's        121    00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.560    pace I received help from people I had        122    00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.280    never met from people whose names I        123    00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.319    would never        124    00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.960    know Harvard is notorious for its        125    00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.520    selective handpicking of students and        126    00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.880    through my experience I learned that        127    00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.720    this campus is full of the most        128    00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.639    passionate people I never felt alone in        129    00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.960    such a warm community and received a        130    00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.800    helping hand from everyone around me in        131    00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.479    return the most I could do was lend my        132    00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.400    crutches to friends at parties to help        133    00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.520    them meet guys a        134    00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.479    tactic that we found surprisingly        135    00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.240    successful tiny moments morphed into        136    00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.240    great memories picture a handsome guy        137    00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.080    you have a crush on inviting you to a        138    00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.800    party that you decline because you can't        139    00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.240    walk up the stairs so he offers to give        140    00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.400    you a        141    00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.280    piggyback I had to rely on others for        142    00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.360    almost everything that I did even your        143    00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.280    classic Sunday Morning Walk of Shame was        144    00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.680    no longer        145    00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.400    independent it's an entirely different        146    00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.840    experience when he has to carry you back        147    00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.000    to your dorm while his roommate carries        148    00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.360    your crutches alongside        149    00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.759    him if you're thinking that would be        150    00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:31.520    awkward and hilarious it totally was but        151    00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.280    these memories are now my most endearing        152    00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.919    Treasures that spark the beginning of a        153    00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:38.960    long lasting        154    00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.080    relationship when I look back at the        155    00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.319    Journey of my injury my goals and my        156    00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:46.360    impression of how I might fit into this        157    00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.800    community completely changed I tried to        158    00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.039    hold on to water polo for 2 years after        159    00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:55.000    I was hurt but I eventually had to let        160    00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.759    that go I learned to immerse myself in        161    00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:01.800    joy I learned how important it is to        162    00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.479    surround yourself with the people who        163    00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:06.440    lift you up in my case sometimes        164    00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.120    literally and walk away from the ones        165    00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.280    who bring you down my injury was not a        166    00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.240    time I was ready to pull out the camera        167    00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.759    and document but it was important and        168    00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:20.960    life-changing many of our greatest life        169    00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.840    lessons are not learned in class or read        170    00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.879    in a textbook we all tackled a huge        171    00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:29.080    transition from the safety net of living        172    00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.960    at home with our families to the        173    00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.639    autonomy of a college campus when we        174    00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:36.319    faced struggles we were forced to rely        175    00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:38.759    on our friends and peers we became        176    00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:41.000    mentors and shoulders to lean on for        177    00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.960    others their Hard Times became our        178    00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.879    challenges just as their moments of Joy        179    00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:48.080    became our        180    00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.479    celebrations we created a new definition        181    00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:53.400    of family one that included all those        182    00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.840    who were alongside us for our hurdles        183    00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.560    and        184    00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.960    heartaches through this process we        185    00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.360    developed Ved our own unique identities        186    00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.400    preparing us to take on the real        187    00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.720    world no matter what has caused you to        188    00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.800    change over the past few years Embrace        189    00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.120    those changes and who you have become as        190    00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.840    a result maybe you took an elective        191    00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.120    senior year and surprised yourself with        192    00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.520    how much you enjoyed the material making        193    00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.400    you rethink your career path late in the        194    00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.440    game maybe you had issues with roommates        195    00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.680    and adjusting to a new living situation        196    00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.199    at the beginning of a school year        197    00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:33.120    perhaps you made a mistake caused harm        198    00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.440    that you took the steps to remedy and        199    00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.680    make right maybe you received inspiring        200    00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.519    advice that made you turn your life        201    00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:43.080    around and walk with more        202    00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.080    confidence when you think of the big        203    00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.760    moments that have affected your college        204    00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.279    career you don't need a digital        205    00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:52.680    photograph to remember        206    00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.519    them one event the Boston Marathon        207    00:08:56.519 --> 00:09:00.160    affected and unified us unlike any other        208    00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.760    everyone remembers where they were        209    00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.040    junior year when they heard about the        210    00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.240    detonations even if they weren't at the        211    00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.519    marathon experiencing the terrifying        212    00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:09.920    Panic        213    00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.399    firsthand everyone remembers the entire        214    00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:14.959    day of lockdown later that week and the        215    00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:19.320    relief when it was over this disaster        216    00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.320    taught us the importance of appreciating        217    00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.959    the strangers around us knowing that at        218    00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:25.920    any given moment they could be the very        219    00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.320    ones to save us it taught us to run to        220    00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.160    help others rather than running away as        221    00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.079    a class leaning on each other we grew        222    00:09:36.079 --> 00:09:38.519    from this tragedy and became stronger        223    00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:41.800    because of it eventually we learned that        224    00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.320    it's okay if something blindsides us and        225    00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.560    causes us to stray from the plan we        226    00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.920    thought we were        227    00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.120    executing sometimes these blindsides can        228    00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.200    teach us to appreciate what is around us        229    00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.880    even more than we did before I        230    00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.640    personally have a renewed appreciation        231    00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.480    for the little things that surround me I        232    00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.440    now appreciate the ability to walk        233    00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.240    freely around campus the ability to        234    00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.680    concentrate without the constant        235    00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.920    reminder of physical pain the ability to        236    00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.200    see someone struggling and be able to        237    00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.680    offer him or her that helping hand        238    00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.040    instead of only receiving        239    00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.640    it all these major changes we have        240    00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.800    experienced in college the good and the        241    00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.440    bad times that shape        242    00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.000    us these are the images the captured        243    00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.200    memories that aren't in a Facebook album        244    00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.920    but instead compile and create the album        245    00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.279    of us the self-portrait with moments we        246    00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:37.920    will always hold        247    00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.440

   you see our love affair started even        57    00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.610    before we met the love of our lives in        58    00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.440    high school we were desperately        59    00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.870    searching for a significant other and we        60    00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.110    set our eyes on the most sought-after        61

just walk up and tell        71    00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.569    someone you want to spend the rest of        72    00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.650    your life with him or her no no as        73    00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.569    society dictates the more appropriate        74    00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.609    strategy is to tell this to their friend        75    00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.560    to instill the appropriate level of        76    00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.230    jealousy I reached out to Stanford        77    00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.510    Harvard's Tanner Californian

 109    00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.000    we found it cute that security guards        110    00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.770    wanted to check and make sure we weren't        111    00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.920    stealing books from the library you        112    00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.710    didn't mind the fact that HUDs idea of        113    00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.770    culinary variety meant variously colored        114    00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.830    yet strangely similarly tasting sauces        115    00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.210    on top of freshly cut cage-free        116    00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:25.010    endangered fish known simply as swine        117    00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.190    and if it wasn't be fettuccine alfredo        118    00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.569    night which god help us all if it was        119    00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:35.699    you didn't mind Harvard bought the        120    00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:38.099    recycled fiberglass version of single        121    00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:40.679    ply toilet paper and limited your use to        122    00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:46.039    two rolls per week yet after a while as        123    00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:49.529    is the case with most relationships the        124    00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:52.259    luster began to where it didn't take        125    00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:54.179    long to discover we were captives of a        126    00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:57.749    crazed romantic suddenly Harvard wanted        127    00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:59.099    to put a label on everything        128    00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:03.539    what is your concentration the answer to        129    00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:05.309    this question depended on each of our        130    00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:08.189    prior interests perhaps you wanted        131    00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:12.889    something serious so you chose golf        132    00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:16.469    maybe you wanted something casual so you        133    00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:19.510    chose applied mathematics        134    00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.450    if you had a crush on Governor Chris        135    00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.620    Christie or Beyonce you chose economics        136    00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.210    because you heard ech had even better        137    00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:34.510    curves but by junior year I started to        138    00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.190    doubt why I ever fell in love with        139    00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.710    Harvard in the first place I no longer        140    00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.570    found backpack checking in Lamont        141    00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.030    library cute and started to play the        142    00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.640    game how many books can I steal without        143    00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:51.220    the security guard noticing two course        144    00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.040    backs a signed copy of man Q's textbook        145    00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:59.020    and an Orangina is a personal best then        146    00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.460    word got out we might have cheated on        147    00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.530    her or at least collaborated with        148    00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.470    multiple individuals causing Harvard to        149    00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.390    read through all of our emails        150    00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:13.300    yet still with all of Harvard's quirks        151    00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.220    senior year reminded us that time is        152    00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.580    fleeting Oh what you wouldn't give now        153    00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.560    to be back with Harvard and the stacks        154    00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:27.979    of whiner one last time I myself have a        155    00:08:27.979 --> 00:08:29.479    memory of discussing my grade with the        156    00:08:29.479 --> 00:08:32.089    TF in the stacks only to learn I        157    00:08:32.089 --> 00:08:35.019    couldn't get it up        158    00:08:38.079 --> 00:08:42.919    perhaps you two have fond memories but        159    00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.260    this doesn't need to be goodbye and I        160    00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.220    don't believe today is a breakup in fact        161    00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.709    it looks more like a wedding I mean our        162    00:08:51.709 --> 00:08:53.990    parents are here they've paid quite the        163    00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.020    dowry        164    00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.690    and Harvard's reverse Tiger mom is still        165    00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.480    nowhere to be found        166    00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.550    and perhaps it's easy to think that        167    00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.810    we're all marrying out of our league        168    00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.620    when we look at Harvard's exes I mean        169    00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.630    just off the top of my head I could name        170    00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.360    Presidents Henry David Thoreau Bill        171    00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.390    Gates Tommy Lee Jones and the artist        172    00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.209    formerly known as and still known as        173    00:09:18.209 --> 00:09:23.620    yo-yo ma yet with all of that in mind we        174    00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.790    must not forget Harvard chose us too she        175    00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.080    liked us enough to put a 1 ring on it        176    00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.790    it's not a one-sided relationship like        177    00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.640    most of those we knew in high school        178    00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.940    tomorrow        179    00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:41.529    we will leave but be bonded forever my        180    00:09:41.529 --> 00:09:45.040    father who is Mexican which really        181    00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.270    doesn't have anything to do with this        182    00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.930    part of the story        183    00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.100    I just mentioned it because the last        184    00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:54.910    time I did        185    00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.870    Harvard accepted me        186    00:10:06.309 --> 00:10:10.070    so I'll throw it out there again        187    00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.780    he once told me marry the right person        188    00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.110    and life no matter how difficult the        189    00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.510    challenges you might face will always be        190    00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.050    fun I have no doubt our challenges will        191    00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.000    get more serious than our complaints of        192    00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.100    having to walk 10 minutes to get to bio        193    00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.610    labs dealing with getting snubbed from        194    00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.360    Harvard

00:01:56.240    2014 let me back up a second that might        34    00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.079    have been a bit extreme        35    00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:05.360    um hi Mom and what's up Cheryl hello        36    00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.640    hi you know I did a lot of preparation        37    00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.239    in writing the speech for you        38    00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.200    today and I did that mostly by thinking        39    00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.319    about what a Harvard oror should look        40    00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.599    and sound        41    00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.239    like and what I came up with was an        42    00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.840    image of a student implementing        43    00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.400    sophisticated literary elements        44    00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.560    to effectively wear his intelligence on        45    00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.080    his sleeve and referencing deep        46    00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.760    thoughtful quotes scrolled by audite        47    00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.080    classical poets and weaving together        48    00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.040    brilliantly constructed sentences of        49    00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.480    solid gold using words taken from deep        50    00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.959    and thoughtful quotes scrolled by arite        51    00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.239    classical        52    00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:58.319    poets and maybe even overusing the word        53    00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.800    audite but        54    00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.360    for 8 minutes at a podium in tent tenery        55    00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.879    theater they are unblemished and        56    00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:13.319    pristine they are the ideal Harvard        57    00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.640    graduate I don't have any of that for        58    00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.599    you today I don't use a lot of metaphors        59    00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.120    and I barely know what audite        60    00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.720    means um some might say that I'm a        61    00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.319    failure in that regard        62    00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.640    and so today I come bearing a simple        63    00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.959    message we have endured what we perceive        64    00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.120    as a failure without really even knowing        65    00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.360    what failure is we have conflated        66    00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.239    failure with not getting exactly what we        67    00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.560    want and in doing so have diminished our        68    00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.879    many        69    00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.319    accomplishments take me for        70    00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.519    example I am a first generation college        71    00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.799    student on one side I spent the majority        72    00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.959    of my free time here acting for        73    00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.120    thousands of people making them laugh        74    00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.400    and sometimes making them        75    00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.879    cry I was even once kissed Square on the        76    00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.320    mouth by Jack Bower if you can believe        77    00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.199    it I        78    00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.320    was I        79    00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.520    also couldn't get into a final Club I        80    00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.120    lost my bid to become business manager        81    00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.240    of the Harvard crimson        82    00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.680    I sometimes struggled with grades and I        83    00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.560    didn't secure a full-time job with the        84    00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.280    company that I interned        85    00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.840    with to the untrained eye what does that        86    00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.080    look        87    00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.639    like a success or something        88    00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.800    different let me switch gears for a        89    00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.960    moment Harvard students we love to        90    00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.160    compare after every exam we Clump        91    00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.840    together and we talk about we wrote who        92    00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.960    hasn't done that before we check our        93    00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.800    Facebooks and see just how many people        94    00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.600    have more impressive jobs or graduate        95    00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.160    opportunities than we        96    00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.479    do frankly there's no more blatant        97    00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.759    comparison of ourselves to others than        98    00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.120    there is on housing day and no more        99    00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.600    blatant perception of        100    00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.120    failure I got qued I thought that was a        101    00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.919    failure I did        102    00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.319    I then got n minus 2 housing within the        103    00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:36.240    quad and I thought        104    00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.840    that that's a failure within a failure        105    00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.400    that that's a fail setion I think I        106    00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.960    think that I think that Edgar Allen po        107    00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.080    must have written something about        108    00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.759    that don't look that up it's just it's        109    00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.199    just strange for a group of individuals        110    00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.919    handpicked by Harvard admissions to        111    00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.160    bring continued successes to the        112    00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.639    greatest University in the world Bar        113    00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.319    None to at times feel compelled to focus        114    00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:11.560    on looking for miniature failures in the        115    00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.520    comparisons that we draw with one        116    00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.960    another        117    00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.080    why I'm not I'm not saying that        118    00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.599    comparing is bad but sometimes        119    00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:24.240    comparison is great the inherent sense        120    00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.440    of competition among students here is        121    00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.440    extremely beneficial to our development        122    00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.440    in some ways it requires us to perform        123    00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.759    better and to work harder a little        124    00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:37.520    competition is healthy and makes you        125    00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.880    grow but I am saying that a lot of times        126    00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.720    we take these comparisons in the most        127    00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.599    negative way        128    00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:49.360    possible an aspiring doctor may feel        129    00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.440    relatively unaccomplished when hearing        130    00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.240    about a friend's Cool Tech        131    00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.240    internship the lack of a thesis paper        132    00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.240    from your sweet of acad mic        133    00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.319    accomplishments becomes a perceived        134    00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:05.160    intellectual inferiority despite your        135    00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.800    lack of interest in academic        136    00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.599    writing being ignored by or rejected        137    00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.639    from a social        138    00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:18.639    organization becomes an assertion that        139    00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:24.240    you may be cool or popular but just not        140    00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.360    enough for your        141    00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.520    peers and from these differences that we        142    00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.280    Rebrand as        143    00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.560    deficiencies we        144    00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.000    manufacture        145    00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.720    failure but we're not failures are we no        146    00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.319    of course not without getting to choying        147    00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:48.440    Lee preachy about Harvard we are all on        148    00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.560    the path to living out remarkably        149    00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.000    successful lives and we knew that from        150    00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.759    the moment we got here we opened that        151    00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:58.840    email from admissions after smashing the        152    00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.479    refresh button again and again on our        153    00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:05.240    inbox we saw our acceptance and we said        154    00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.280    well I'm        155    00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.199    set and in a lot of cases it didn't even        156    00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:15.479    take a year for some of us to see some        157    00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:18.520    great thing that one of our peers did        158    00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.759    and say whoa I'm no longer        159    00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:26.360    set our futures become uncertain to us        160    00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.680    often based on something totally out of        161    00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.599    our control        162    00:08:30.599 --> 00:08:33.519    what's more we don't take the time to        163    00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:36.719    truly celebrate the success in the first        164    00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:40.279    place it might appear that way sometimes        165    00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:43.560    in the form of a celebratory meal or        166    00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.720    drink or gift but at a certain point        167    00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.000    albeit a relatively minor one it becomes        168    00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.640    an issue of you being behind and you        169    00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.360    needing to catch up so that you're not        170    00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.560    considered a fa        171    00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.200    failure now I don't mean to make Harvard        172    00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.200    students out to be petulant Frenemies        173    00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.600    who constantly feel pessimistic about        174    00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.640    their abilities they're        175    00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.000    not they're diverse down to earth and        176    00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.720    downright brilliant check out that fancy        177    00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.440    literary        178    00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.800    device and I'm honored to be counted        179    00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.399    among the company of such talented        180    00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:28.320    individuals but I am saying that        181    00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.120    sometimes not being first or the best        182    00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.959    can sour what we've accomplished and        183    00:09:35.959 --> 00:09:38.920    drive us to saying or thinking at some        184    00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.839    point I have        185    00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:47.360    failed and as I said before we are so        186    00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.040    not failures at all look at        187    00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:57.120    us we are poets musicians        188    00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.839    artists we are athletes and champions at        189    00:10:00.839 --> 00:10:04.959    that we are scientists bound to unlock        190    00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:07.360    the greatest discoveries here to for in        191    00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.399    human        192    00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:11.680    history we are future politicians who        193    00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.320    will shape this nation for the better        194    00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.040    there may even be a future president        195    00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.200    Sitting In This Crowd this        196    00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.200    afternoon and guess        197    00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.800    what that        198    00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:30.399    President might not have had a 4.0        199    00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:31.720    and that        200    00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.360    President may not have gotten the dream        201    00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.920    job that he or she thought they        202    00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.839    wanted and do you know what I'm willing        203    00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:39.560    to        204    00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.120    bet that        205    00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.839    president is sitting here today and        206    00:10:44.839 --> 00:10:47.959    listening to me talk looking back on his        207    00:10:47.959 --> 00:10:52.760    or her four years and might be reminded        208    00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.880    of the        209    00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.760    failures rather than the        210    00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.000    future disregarding all the great things        211    00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.720    happening right now and those that will        212    00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.279    happen in the many years to        213    00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:11.720    come so I stand up here before you and I        214    00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:16.040    look back at the 45 months since I first        215    00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.000    stepped into Harvard Yard I know it's a        216    00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.160    lot of        217    00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:24.760    months as a fresh-faced fledgeling        218    00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.120    freshman and what do I see        219    00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.120    well I didn't get the social standing I        220    00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.320    thought I wanted or the big leadership        221    00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.920    position that I thought I wanted or the        222    00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.880    grades that I maybe        223    00:11:46.519 --> 00:11:49.519    wanted or the job that I thought I        224    00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:50.720    definitely        225    00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.800    wanted on paper that looks a lot like        226    00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.440    failure that's academic life personal        227    00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.720    Life Social Life future professional        228    00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:08.079    life on paper that's a whole lot of        229    00:12:08.079 --> 00:12:10.839    nothing you know        230    00:12:10.839 --> 00:12:13.480    what that's        231    00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.959    fine because I didn't really        232    00:12:15.959 --> 00:12:17.880    fail did        233    00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.959    I I just didn't get what I thought I        234    00:12:21.959 --> 00:12:23.720    wanted        235    00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.600    instead I got        236    00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.160    friendships that will last a        237    00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.800    lifetime I got a great job that I love        238    00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.240    keeps me close to        239    00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.440    home I found a girl that I        240    00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.880    love and I got a fantastic        241    00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.880    education but I didn't get exactly what        242    00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.240    I thought I        243    00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.880    wanted none of us has always gotten        244    00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.959    exactly what we want and at one point or        245    00:12:50.959 --> 00:12:54.279    another we have all considered that        246    00:12:54.279 --> 00:12:56.920    failure and it takes a long time to        247    00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.800    resolve that perceived failure as a        248    00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.680    learning experience or as an opportunity        249    00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.680    for other doors to        250    00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:08.800    open but especially this week a week        251    00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.800    spent celebrating our hard work and our        252    00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.720    triumphs a week culminating in a        253    00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.480    commencement so named because it marks A        254    00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.560    New        255    00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.360    Beginning we should start        256    00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.639    focusing on the        257    00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:28.160    success because in the end we can try to        258    00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.720    measure our relative level of success        259    00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.320    here at Harvard based on the setbacks        260    00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.240    and the defeats and the B        261    00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.920    minuses or we can take a step back and        262    00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.560    see just how little that matters in the        263    00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.800    long        264    00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.399    run only then will we truly recognize        265    00:13:51.399 --> 00:13:56.519    how far we've come and how far we'll        266    00:13:56.839 --> 00:14:02.399    go I failed        267    00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.519    Harvard or did        268    00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:09.720    I thank you

   00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.960    [Applause]        2    00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.480    thank you Ryan and thank you Boston for        3    00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.639    being so kind to us        4    00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.519    today I        5    00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.000    arrived uh at Harvard Business School uh        6    00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.440    in very bad        7    00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.680    shape I arrived 4 years after        8    00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.760    applying uh as a member of the final        9    00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.960    internship class at Leman Brothers where        10    00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.200    they fired 3,000 people in my first        11    00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.640    week I arrived after spending a year in        12    00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.600    the Hallow Halls of Washington        13    00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.280    DC where I developed an uncanny        14    00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.920    knack for making copies and making        15    00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.480    making coffee uh making liberals and        16    00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.479    conservatives very        17    00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.400    upset I arrived after a failed attempt        18    00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.240    to help a Democrat become governor of        19    00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.799    Texas and a frustrating attempt to        20    00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.840    survive startup life in New York City on        21    00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.079    tuna fish and peanut        22    00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.360    butter and even worse for some of you        23    00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.600    here        24    00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.079    today I arrived at Harvard after gradua        25    00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.159    in from        26    00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.759    Yale very bad shape        27    00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.439    indeed and when I got here I made two        28    00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.960    promises to        29    00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.360    myself do not work in another        30    00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.880    startup and do not work and another        31    00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.240    nonprofit and when I leave this place        32    00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.000    tomorrow I will begin my full-time life        33    00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.840    at the helm of a startup        34    00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.840    nonprofit        35    00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.680    tell        36    00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.640    clip so the question becomes very        37    00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.080    clear what in the world has happened in        38    00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.440    the last two        39    00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.200    years I spent a lot of time        40    00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.440    grappling with that        41    00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.640    question but I didn't find the answer in        42    00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.560    any of the cases that we have read in        43    00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.239    the last two        44    00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.440    years I traced it instead to a single        45    00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.720    moment on a single        46    00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.319    night almost 7 years ago when my whole        47    00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.040    life        48    00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.680    changed it was around 1:30 in the        49    00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.080    morning when I heard the first knock at        50    00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.360    the door of my home down in        51    00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.159    Dallas I remember the next        52    00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.720    sound it was a        53    00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.920    bang and the next sound was a        54    00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.000    crash as that front door burst        55    00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.959    open I remember how shocked I        56    00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.519    felt how hard it was to        57    00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.480    breathe when I saw two thieves with guns        58    00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.879    pointed at my        59    00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.840    face I remember how trapped I        60    00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.400    felt when I realized there wasn't        61    00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.200    anywhere to run how totally helpless I        62    00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.200    felt        63    00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.400    as my head hit the floor and they tied        64    00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.040    my hands behind my        65    00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.760    back I remember        66    00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.400    praying what I knew would be my final        67    00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.000    prayer and feeling so        68    00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.920    afraid of what was about to happen to me        69    00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.159    in this moment and in the darkness to        70    00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:01.000    come but a strange thing happened        71    00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.200    as I accepted the fact that I was about        72    00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.519    to        73    00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.120    die I stopped being        74    00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.720    afraid it was in that moment that        75    00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.000    peace a deep still        76    00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.040    calm washed over my        77    00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.000    body it was just after that moment that        78    00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.240    I heard police sirens coming down the        79    00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.160    street and the two men scrambling to run        80    00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.960    out of the same door that they had just        81    00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.120    kicked        82    00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.720    in it was because of that moment I now        83    00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.479    realize that I broke the promises that I        84    00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.240    made to myself when I first stepped foot        85    00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.759    on this        86    00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.120    campus you see up until that        87    00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.360    night fear had been driving me for a        88    00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.160    very long        89    00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.840    time fear that I wouldn't accomplish        90    00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.520    enough to make others love        91    00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.479    me fear that I wouldn't earn enough to        92    00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.759    repay the debts that I owed to so many        93    00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.160    who had sacrificed so much        94    00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.960    fear that I would prove the teacher's        95    00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.199    right who said when I got into Yale        96    00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.199    there's no way that boy is going to        97    00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.319    graduate he'll be home before the end of        98    00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:23.240    the first semester they obviously had        99    00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.360    never heard of my dear friend Mr gr        100    00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.479    inflation        101    00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.400    this        102    00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.680    fear drove me to go harder to go higher        103    00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.080    it drove me to see my journey from        104    00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.560    oakcliff Texas to Yale as a chance to        105    00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.720    leave behind all the challenges I had        106    00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.720    known and grab hold to a life of ease        107    00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.280    and comfort and        108    00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.000    security but when I did not die on that        109    00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.560    floor I began to ask myself why I had        110    00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.720    been allowed to        111    00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.560    live and it struck me that if I had been        112    00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.960    judged that        113    00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.240    evening I wasn't going to be asked how        114    00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.759    fancy my degrees had been or how many        115    00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:18.479    people I had known or how much money I        116    00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:21.800    had piled into my bank account if that        117    00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.120    night had been my last my maker would        118    00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.560    have peered into my heart to ask not        119    00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.319    what I had been able to get        120    00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:33.000    but what I have been willing to        121    00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000    give and having nothing in my pockets        122    00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.639    then or        123    00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:42.560    now I decided to give my life to a cause        124    00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.240    greater than        125    00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.960    myself but I didn't know how to do that        126    00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.400    and so one day in my junior year I        127    00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.840    hurried over to Yale law school where I        128    00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.720    figured everyone had dedicated        129    00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.400    themselves to some grand cause or        130    00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.240    another the speaker that day was a        131    00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.479    lawyer but he had come to give a very        132    00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:06.560    surprising        133    00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.840    message if you wanted to change the        134    00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.479    world in the 20th century he said you        135    00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:15.360    had to go to law        136    00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.240    school that's        137    00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.000    funny but in the 21st century if you        138    00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.720    want to change the world go to business        139    00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.400    school and so the next chance I got I        140    00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.319    applied to this place to        141    00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:35.520    Harvard I thought it was the only thing        142    00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.599    to do because I had read an old New        143    00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:42.120    Yorker interview with Peter Gomes the        144    00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.680    iconic minister of Memorial Church in        145    00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.919    which he said I        146    00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:48.960    quote this        147    00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.520    University was founded by Puritans        148    00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.000    fleeing England to create a new world        149    00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.680    order they hoped that the world would        150    00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.960    reform itself in the light of New        151    00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.080    England the light of New England was        152    00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.360    Boston the heart of Boston was Cambridge        153    00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.199    and the center of Cambridge was        154    00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:14.080    Harvard therefore Harvard is the light        155    00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.440    of the        156    00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.800    world and you stand in an unbroken        157    00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.720    procession stretching all the way back        158    00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.800    to Moses who would himself have come to        159    00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.919    Harvard        160    00:08:30.919 --> 00:08:34.719    if it was good enough for Moses I        161    00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.120    thought it was good enough for        162    00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.560    me so here I        163    00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.880    came after my own years in the        164    00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.640    desert        165    00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.560    tied        166    00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.959    frustrated ready for an easier path some        167    00:08:51.959 --> 00:08:55.040    of you may have felt the same way but        168    00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.560    something about this place something        169    00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.399    about the last two years        170    00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:02.680    convinced us to turn away from those        171    00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.079    paths and believe that there was a        172    00:09:05.079 --> 00:09:09.279    better higher harder way to        173    00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:11.680    go it wasn't that Harvard Business        174    00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.760    School changed who we        175    00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:19.079    were no instead I think it reminded us        176    00:09:19.079 --> 00:09:20.720    who we could        177    00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.040    be it reminded us that we didn't have to        178    00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:28.720    wait until we were rich or powerful or        179    00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.800    until we actually knew Finance to make a        180    00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.880    difference we could act right here right        181    00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.360    now it was here where the question was        182    00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.480    asked when will we live in a world where        183    00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.800    gender equality is not the exception but        184    00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.320    the rule and it was our women's Student        185    00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.640    Association and our ambassadors who        186    00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.959    raised their voices to say right        187    00:09:56.959 --> 00:10:00.399    now it was here where the call for help        188    00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:01.360    rang        189    00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.760    out from cities like Detroit Michigan        190    00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.360    and Athens Greece and Cairo Egypt and        191    00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.600    elsewhere around the globe and it was        192    00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.160    our classmates who raised their hands to        193    00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.480    say I'm coming right now it was here        194    00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.040    where tabloids        195    00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.440    wondered when would LeBron James attend        196    00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.519    an HBS book launch        197    00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:28.040    party        198    00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.640    when would Sir Alex Ferguson teach in an        199    00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.200    HBS classroom oh when would Michael        200    00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.399    Douglas take one of us to the Super        201    00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:43.600    Bowl and to these great questions it was        202    00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.160    our professor Anita elbery and our Dean        203    00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:53.600    nitt noro who boldly replied right        204    00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.440    now and it was        205    00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.440    here in the dark dark corner of a        206    00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.720    section dinner        207    00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.800    party where I found three Brave and        208    00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.360    Brilliant Souls who decided to join me        209    00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.120    on an 8,000m journey to launch NBAs        210    00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.399    Across        211    00:11:13.399 --> 00:11:16.399    America we set out on this journey        212    00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:19.399    because we believed there was a serious        213    00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:21.760    challenge facing Our        214    00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.079    Generation what my friend Andrew mangino        215    00:11:25.079 --> 00:11:27.760    calls the dream        216    00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.399    depression and the Great Depression of        217    00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:33.560    the 1930s you see folks would take their        218    00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.120    money and their valuables and hide them        219    00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.440    under their mattress and their        220    00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.279    floorboards but now in this dream        221    00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:45.480    depression in a time of uncertainty the        222    00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.600    whole world over folks are taken their        223    00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.760    dreams and their hopes and their        224    00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.279    aspirations and hiding them in all types        225    00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:58.639    of places never to see the light of day        226    00:11:58.639 --> 00:12:01.760    well we we hit the road because we knew        227    00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.720    the dreams would not be found in a case        228    00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.200    or a cubicle they'd be hiding in the        229    00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.200    nooks and        230    00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.839    crannies and in the unbeaten        231    00:12:10.839 --> 00:12:13.000    pths so as we        232    00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000    traveled we saw the signs for countless        233    00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.199    big cities and Tiny towns but we also        234    00:12:19.199 --> 00:12:21.720    saw the signs for        235    00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.040    hope we saw the signs for Hope and the        236    00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.680    fact that a black guy from Texas a white        237    00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.600    guy guy from Maryland a Jewish girl from        238    00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.560    New Mexico and an Arab guy from Morocco        239    00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.680    could pitch a tent and a cow pasture in        240    00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.040    rural        241    00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.600    Montana we realized that night that we        242    00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.399    were all in this together we were tied        243    00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:45.519    to those        244    00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:47.959    ranchers as much as we were tied to the        245    00:12:47.959 --> 00:12:50.760    trumpet player in New Orleans or the        246    00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.040    venture capitalist in Colorado or the        247    00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.079    Lebanese man in the middle eastern        248    00:12:56.079 --> 00:12:58.320    restaurant in ramulus Michigan who        249    00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.519    thought that Harvard was in Ohio we were        250    00:13:00.519 --> 00:13:02.880    tied to him        251    00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.360    too we saw the signs for Hope out        252    00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.279    there and entrepreneurs like Sebastian        253    00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:13.760    Jackson who runs a barber shop that        254    00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.240    recycles the hair from clients to make        255    00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.079    compost and plant trees in some of        256    00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:21.720    Detroit's most blighted        257    00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.600    neighborhoods he told us of his        258    00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.399    dream not just to start a business that        259    00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:29.560    could save his family        260    00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.160    but to grow a business that could save        261    00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.040    his        262    00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.480    City and even though we did not have an        263    00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.839    expert        264    00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:40.760    opinion even though we did not have any        265    00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:44.240    money to invest even though some of us        266    00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.519    did not even have much        267    00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.320    hair he welcomed Us        268    00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.920    in because he believes that four people        269    00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.440    from this place with this education        270    00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.320    had to be able to help him bring his        271    00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.680    dream to        272    00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.959    life so        273    00:14:05.959 --> 00:14:10.240    when after our time with him Sebastian's        274    00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.600    Revenue        275    00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.959    tripled and he raised        276    00:14:13.959 --> 00:14:16.240    $100,000 from local        277    00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.040    investors and he tore down an abandoned        278    00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.120    home and used the wood to renovate his        279    00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.480    barber shop he called to say thank you        280    00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.000    but he also left me with one message        281    00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.839    that I leave with you        282    00:14:32.839 --> 00:14:35.079    today he said        283    00:14:35.079 --> 00:14:38.639    Casey you've got more work to        284    00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:41.639    do so while I may never        285    00:14:41.639 --> 00:14:44.399    forget what time it was when I heard        286    00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:48.079    that first knock at my door seven years        287    00:14:48.079 --> 00:14:51.880    ago right now is the time that I'm        288    00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.320    obsessed with        289    00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.800    today because now I        290    00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.399    see after all the miles and all the        291    00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:00.720    memor memories of the last two years now        292    00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:07.160    I see the biggest sign for hope you my        293    00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.320    friends my fellow        294    00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.199    graduates not because of what we've done        295    00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:16.680    but because I know we have more work to        296    00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.240    do in your hands as well as mine lies        297    00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.560    the hope for a new generation of        298    00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.680    Business        299    00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.880    Leaders in which each of us becomes a        300    00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.839    pioneer        301    00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:32.360    in which each of us decides to travel        302    00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.199    unknown roads in search of Unsolved        303    00:15:35.199 --> 00:15:38.639    challenges in which each of us commits        304    00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:40.720    our time and talent not just to the        305    00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.040    treasures of today but to the frontier        306    00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.800    of tomorrow where new dreams and new        307    00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.839    hopes and new possibilities are waiting        308    00:15:50.839 --> 00:15:53.279    for us to pull them from the darkness        309    00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:55.759    yes we have more work to        310    00:15:55.759 --> 00:15:58.680    do and as we leave this place for the        311    00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:03.040    last time some as Baker Scholars and        312    00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.399    some by the seat of our        313    00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:09.399    pants we take up the work not just of        314    00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:12.800    making a living but of making a        315    00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.800    life for if all we've learned here are        316    00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.240    four Ps and five forces and Six        317    00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.639    Sigma we will prove William Fulon right        318    00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:27.279    that we labor under a        319    00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:31.319    curse that we live not for love but for        320    00:16:31.319 --> 00:16:34.920    lust for defeats in which nobody loses        321    00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.519    anything of value for victories without        322    00:16:38.519 --> 00:16:41.959    hope and worst of all Without Pity or        323    00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:45.120    compassion that our griefs grieve on no        324    00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.680    Universal bones leaving no scars that we        325    00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.240    live not from the heart but from the        326    00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.880    glands no my friends we have more work        327    00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:00.600    to do hard work frightening work        328    00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.720    uncertain work unending work work that        329    00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.520    may test us work that may defeat us work        330    00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.120    for which we may not get the credit but        331    00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:12.319    work on which the whole world        332    00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:14.799    depends the time is        333    00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:17.160    short and the odds        334    00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.880    alone but I believe that we are ready        335    00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.799    nonetheless with the love of those who        336    00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:29.000    raised us with the lessons of those who        337    00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.080    taught us with the strength of those who        338    00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.640    stand beside us as we face what lies        339    00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:40.960    ahead I say let us begin thank        340    00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000    you        "

   4    00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.640    Graduates, parents,    faculty, this        5    00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.230    is really such a    remarkable day--        6    00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.750    obviously for you,    but also for me.        7    00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.990    Because after spending a life    obsessing over True Crime,        8    00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.040    the impossible happened.        9    00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.630    I was asked to speak at the    Harvard Law Commencement        10    00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.790    and accept an    honorary legal degree.        11    00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.490    Yes, isn't that    the American dream?        12    00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.199    Me, Mindy Kaling,    daughter of immigrant--        13    00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.115    ERIC JORDAN: So there's    no actual-- you're not        14    00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.754    getting a-- just not happening.        15    00:00:33.754 --> 00:00:34.246    MINDY KALING: I'm not?        16    00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:34.746    OK.        17    00:00:34.746 --> 00:00:36.706    [LAUGHTER]        18    00:00:36.706 --> 00:00:38.690    OK.        19    00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.410    So apparently, there is a    little miscommunication.        20    00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.300    I am no longer Mindy    Kaling, Esquire, Attorney        21    00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.900    at Law, Comedian, Actress.        22    00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.370    I'm just-- that's cool.        23    00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.960    No, I'm just supposed to stand    up here and give funny remarks.        24    00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.376    And then I'm    supposed to sit down.        25    00:00:53.376 --> 00:00:53.940    That's OK.        26    00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.680    That doesn't seem fair.        27    00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.263    But that's OK.        28    00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:57.290    I'll do that.        29    00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.450    I know what you're    probably thinking.        30    00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.270    Mindy Kaling-- why    did they ask her?        31    00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.080    She's just a pretty    Hollywood starlet.        32    00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.750    What does that quadruple    threat know about the law?        33    00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.200    Sure, she seems really down    to earth, and pretty in,        34    00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.300    like, a totally accessible way.        35    00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.150    And yeah, she was on People    magazine's most beautiful        36    00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.600    people list this year    and also in 2008.        37    00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.960    But what intelligent    remarks could she possibly        38    00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.590    make about the law?        39    00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.500    She's probably too busy    doing shampoo commercials.        40    00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.910    But I'm not too busy.        41    00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.730    In fact, I would kill to    do a shampoo commercial.        42    00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.770    So if anyone from    L'Oreal is out there,        43    00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.950    please just Snapchat    me after this.        44    00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.230    But I'll have you know, I    do know a ton about the law.        45    00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.850    Because I sue everybody.        46    00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.880    [LAUGHTER]        47    00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.560    And excuse me, there is a burger    named after me at Bartley's.        48    00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.300    And they have    guaranteed me that is        49    00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.820    going to be there until another    tertiary member of the cast        50    00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.910    of The Office gets    their own TV show.        51    00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.450    And they don't just name    burgers after anyone there.        52    00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.560    Noted chef Guy Fieri has one.        53    00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.289    Noted drunk driver    Justin Bieber has one.        54    00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.020    [LAUGHTER]        55    00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.520    OK?        56    00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.910    So that's pretty good company.        57    00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.050    Thank you.        58    00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.700    Look, I get it.        59    00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.070    On the surface, it    would appear that I        60    00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.590    am an unconventional    choice to speak here today.        61    00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.530    To be honest, I don't    know much about the law.        62    00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.190    I graduated in 2001    from Dartmouth College--        63    00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.870    AUDIENCE: Woo!        64    00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.470    MINDY KALING: Thank you.        65    00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.780    That man is drunk.        66    00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.900    [LAUGHTER]        67    00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.200    --an academic institution    located in lawless, rural New        68    00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.520    Hampshire, where,    when you arrive,        69    00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.940    you are given a    flask of moonshine        70    00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.820    and a box of fireworks.        71    00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.460    And you are told simply    to, quote, ""go to town.""        72    00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.540    [LAUGHTER]        73    00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.260    Except there is no town.        74    00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.934    There is only a forest and    a row a fraternity houses        75    00:02:49.934 --> 00:02:50.850    that smell like urine.        76    00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.440    [LAUGHTER]        77    00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.740    Actually, little know fact--    Dartmouth has a law school.        78    00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.270    It's just one semester.        79    00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.900    And its coursework is entirely    centered on how to beat a DUI.        80    00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.600    [LAUGHTER]        81    00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.310    But I am not here to extol the    virtues of the Dartmouth Red        82    00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.430    Bull School of Law.        83    00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.740    I'm here to talk to you.        84    00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.400    So even though I    have no idea why        85    00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.850    I was asked to speak here    today, I prepared this speech        86    00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.550    very carefully, the    way that any good        87    00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.790    Dartmouth-educated    graduate would.        88    00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.260    I drank a 40 of Jagermeister.        89    00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.160    Then I called my dad to see    if he would get me out of it.        90    00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.870    He's here today.        91    00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.750    He could not get me out of it.        92    00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.970    So I tried to hire    a college freshman        93    00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.470    to write it for me in    exchange for a $200 gift        94    00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.460    card to Newbury Comics.        95    00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.970    That didn't work out.        96    00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.080    Finally, seeing that I    absolutely had to do this        97    00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.130    and couldn't get out of    it, rolled up my sleeves,        98    00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.160    sat down at my    computer, and tried        99    00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.630    to buy a commencement    address off        100    00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.806    of    movingcommencementspeeches.com.        101    00:03:48.806 --> 00:03:50.682    My credit card was declined.        102    00:03:50.682 --> 00:03:52.140    So I had to write    the thing myself.        103    00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.260    And here we are today.        104    00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.480    There are many, many    distinguished speakers        105    00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.090    who have spoken here today.        106    00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.500    I am sharing the stage with    Preet Bharara, US Attorney        107    00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.090    for the Southern    District of New York.        108    00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.790    We've heard what    a great guy he is.        109    00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.740    In 2012, he was named    by Time magazine        110    00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.990    as one of the 100 most    influential people        111    00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.650    in the world, which apparently,    they're just giving out.        112    00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.280    [LAUGHTER]        113    00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.700    According to Time, he    has battled terrorism,        114    00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.160    as evidenced by his conviction    of the Times Square Bomber.        115    00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.590    He's crippled international    arms dealers, drug traffickers,        116    00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.960    and Dublin financial fraud.        117    00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.120    Clearly, Harvard    wanted you to see        118    00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.250    the full range of what    India can produce here.        119    00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.390    [LAUGHTER]        120    00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.660    Mr. Bharara fights finance    criminals and terrorism.        121    00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.160    I meet handsome men in cute    and unusual ways on television.        122    00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.940    And next season, my character    might get a pet puppy.        123    00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.630    So is one more important    than the other?        124    00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.380    Who can say.        125    00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.560    [LAUGHTER]        126    00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.620    Dean Martha Minow is here.        127    00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.750    She has fought for    women, families, refugees        128    00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.350    and is a champion for education.        129    00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.480    She has published over 15 books,    such as Not Only for Myself--        130    00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.610    Identity, Politics, and Law.        131    00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.650    Dean Minow and I    have a lot in common.        132    00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.500    I, too, wrote a    book, as you know.        133    00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.350    It was called Is Everyone    Hanging Out Here Without Me?        134    00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.390    You can buy it right around    the corner at Urban Outfitters,        135    00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.140    next to a book called The    Marijuana Chef's Cookbook.        136    00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.640    [LAUGHTER]        137    00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.980    So I digress right now.        138    00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.840    What I really wanted to say    is that I am extremely honored        139    00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.230    to be with such a    spectacular gathering of very        140    00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.530    smart and dedicated people.        141    00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.710    This graduating class has three    Rhodes Scholars, 11 Fulbright        142    00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.130    Scholars, and four members    of the Peace Corps.        143    00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.330    This group before    me is bristling        144    00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.820    with ambitious young    people, many of whom        145    00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.370    have already started    charities and        146    00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.560    philanthropic organizations.        147    00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.430    And now, with this diploma    in hand, most of you        148    00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.880    will go on to the    noblest of pursuits--        149    00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.380    like helping a cable company    acquire a telecom company.        150    00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.890    [LAUGHTER]        151    00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.320    You will defend BP from birds.        152    00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.910    [LAUGHTER]        153    00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.970    You will spend hours arguing    that the well water was        154    00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.710    contaminated well before    the fracking occurred.        155    00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.040    [LAUGHTER]        156    00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.000    One of you will sort out    the details of my prenup.        157    00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.400    A dozen of you will help me    with my acrimonious divorce.        158    00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.940    And one of you will fall    in love in the process.        159    00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.423    I'm talking to    you, Noah Feldman.        160    00:06:17.423 --> 00:06:19.540    [LAUGHTER AND CHEERS]        161    00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.600    And let's be honest,    Harvard Law is the best        162    00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.070    of the Harvard    graduate programs.        163    00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.930    OK, I can say this.        164    00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.200    We're amongst friends, OK.        165    00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.640    The Business School    is full of crooks.        166    00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.053    The Divinity School is just    a bunch of weird virgins.        167    00:06:31.053 --> 00:06:32.330    [LAUGHTER]        168    00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.870    The School of Design is    like European burnouts.        169    00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.160    And don't get me started    on the Kennedy School.        170    00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.900    What kind of degree do you get    from there-- public policy?        171    00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:41.450    OK, right.        172    00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.030    You mean a master's in boring    me to death at a dinner party.        173    00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.590    I'm sorry.        174    00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.690    Let's just be honest.        175    00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.680    The Med School is just a    bunch of nerdy Indians.        176    00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.000    I can say that, by the way.        177    00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.510    Hey, hey, I can--    Preet can say that.        178    00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.110    The rest of you--    you are out of line.        179    00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.850    That is racial.        180    00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:58.600    How dare you?        181    00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.480    [LAUGHTER]        182    00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.830    But I digress, again.        183    00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.800    I think I'm just really    excited to be here.        184    00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.260    The real reason I am    here is, as Connie said,        185    00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.150    I am obsessed with justice--    not so much with the law,        186    00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.750    but with justice.        187    00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.670    Actually, in my mind,    law is that pesky thing        188    00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.260    that often gets in    the way of justice.        189    00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.880    I believe in the Clint    Eastwood school of the law.        190    00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.960    An eye for an eye?        191    00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.170    I don't think so.        192    00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.430    That solves nothing.        193    00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.260    You take my eye, I take    your life, my friend--        194    00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:29.960    [LAUGHTER]        195    00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.180    --OK, in a dual,    Aaron Burr style.        196    00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.630    I don't want your stupid eye.        197    00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.980    For what, my eye collection?        198    00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:36.480    You're dead.        199    00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.966    [LAUGHTER]        200    00:07:37.966 --> 00:07:39.590    Yes, duels are the    first thing that you        201    00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.330    learn when you enter my    graduate program, the Harvard        202    00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.980    School of Vengeance.        203    00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.040    But again, that is not what I    came here to talk to you about.        204    00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.490    That's for the reception after.        205    00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.935    We can talk about that more.        206    00:07:50.935 --> 00:07:53.070    The Harvard Law    School crest, which        207    00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.550    you can see in front    of you, has the word        208    00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.250    ""veritas,"" which means    ""truth"" in Latin.        209    00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.960    I know this because    though I have        210    00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.650    been known as Mindy    my whole life,        211    00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.280    my first name is actually    Vera, which also means ""truth.""        212    00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:06.780    It's true.        213    00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.450    It's actually too boring    to make that fact up.        214    00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.420    And if you look at    the crest, you'll        215    00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.700    notice that under    this hallowed word,        216    00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.100    there are three    bunches of asparagus.        217    00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.330    [LAUGHTER]        218    00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:25.060    Because asparagus is the    tallest and the proudest        219    00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.330    of the vegetables-- the pillar    of the vegetable kingdom.        220    00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.970    And it's-- it's like the Lat--        221    00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.190    OK that is not asparagus.        222    00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.770    That is-- that is    wheat, which makes also        223    00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.075    not a ton of sense, either.        224    00:08:39.075 --> 00:08:39.575    [LAUGHTER]        225    00:08:39.575 --> 00:08:42.225    OK, well that was like    three pages of my speech.        226    00:08:42.225 --> 00:08:43.520    [LAUGHTER]        227    00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.560    Nope-- OK, that was-- that's    a call back to asparagus.        228    00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.880    I have this really funny    run about Hollandaise.        229    00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.180    You'll never get to hear that.        230    00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.680    You know, this isn't    going anywhere.        231    00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.970    I'm going to move past    trying to make sense        232    00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.470    of your crest, which    makes no sense.        233    00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.420    Harvard Law has an incredible    number of illustrious alumni.        234    00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:08.220    President Barack Obama attended    Harvard Law-- or so he says.        235    00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.070    Elle Woods went here, from    the trenchant documentary,        236    00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:11.915    Legally Blonde.        237    00:09:11.915 --> 00:09:13.050    [LAUGHTER]        238    00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.792    It's a very moving film.        239    00:09:14.792 --> 00:09:16.250    Dean Minow, you    should check it out        240    00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.780    after you read my    book, actually.        241    00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.530    Six of the nine    Supreme Court Justices        242    00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:21.830    are graduates of Harvard Law.        243    00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.100    The other three, I don't    know where they went.        244    00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.435    I think it was, like,    University of Phoenix.        245    00:09:24.435 --> 00:09:25.400    I'm not sure.        246    00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.570    [LAUGHTER]        247    00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.880    No, no, no.        248    00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.010    As we all know, they    attended your friendly rival,        249    00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.130    Yale Law School.        250    00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.730    OK, let's just--    can we take a moment        251    00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.150    to talk about this    rivalry, everybody?        252    00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.570    I know that you have a    chip on your shoulder.        253    00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:39.320    OK?        254    00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.900    Yale Law is always number one.        255    00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.300    And you are always number two.        256    00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.300    Sometimes Stanford    comes in there,        257    00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.810    bumps you down to number three.        258    00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:47.670    But listen.        259    00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.060    Let me tell you something.        260    00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.150    From where I stand from    an outsider's perspective,        261    00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.765    here's the truth:    you are all nerds.        262    00:09:54.765 --> 00:09:56.250    [LAUGHTER]        263    00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:56.920    OK?        264    00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.772    All of you.        265    00:09:57.772 --> 00:09:58.980    Except here's the difference.        266    00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.438    The only difference    is that you are        267    00:10:00.438 --> 00:10:04.850    the nerds that are going to make    some serious bank, all right?        268    00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.390    Which is why I'm here today--        269    00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.430    [LAUGHTER]        270    00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:10.060    --to marry the    best-looking amongst you.        271    00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.760    [LAUGHTER]        272    00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.150    And back to this beautiful    diploma-- this Harvard Law        273    00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.650    degree.        274    00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:16.640    It's not just a piece of paper.        275    00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.980    You can do whatever    you want now,        276    00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.450    and this institution will    follow you everywhere.        277    00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.050    OK?        278    00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.310    If you kill someone, you are    the ""Harvard Law Murderer.""        279    00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:26.130    [LAUGHTER]        280    00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.337    If you are caught in a lewd    act in a public restroom,        281    00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:31.170    you're the ""Harvard Law    Pervert,"" my friend.        282    00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.290    [LAUGHTER]        283    00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:33.860    And then you can    represent yourself.        284    00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.200    And you'll probably    get acquitted.        285    00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.500    Because you went to Harvard.        286    00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.080    In fact, the only    downside of this degree        287    00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.566    is when you run for    Senate, you will        288    00:10:43.566 --> 00:10:44.940    have to distance    yourself from it        289    00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.440    to seem more like    a regular person.        290    00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.080    You'll tuck in    your flannel shirts        291    00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.400    into your freshly pressed    jeans that you just bought.        292    00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.150    And still, this institution    is going to haunt you.        293    00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.510    No matter how many    diners you eat at,        294    00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.920    no matter how many guitar solos    you do with Rascal Flatts,        295    00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.560    you are Harvard to the grave.        296    00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.780    You won't be able to buy a    pickup truck rusty enough        297    00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.500    to distance yourself from    this place, all right?        298    00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.150    Mitt Romney-- he preferred    to be known as the Mormon Guy        299    00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.170    to distract himself    from his Harvard past.        300    00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.190    Now I'd like to get a little    serious for just a moment.        301    00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.460    I am an American    of Indian origin        302    00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.070    whose parents were    raised in India.        303    00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.430    My dad is actually here.        304    00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.760    They met in Africa,    emigrated to America.        305    00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.640    And now I am the    star and the creator        306    00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.240    of my own network    television program.        307    00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.270    The continents traveled,    the languages mastered,        308    00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.800    and the standardized    tests prepared and taken        309    00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.490    for over and over again,    and the cultures navigated        310    00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.610    are amazing, even to me.        311    00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.890    My family's dream about a    future unfettered by limitations        312    00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:52.010    imposed by who you know and    dependent only on what you know        313    00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.950    was only possible in America.        314    00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.590    Their romance with    this country is        315    00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:01.480    more romantic than any romantic    comedy that I could ever write.        316    00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.110    And it's all because    they believed, as I do,        317    00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.960    in the concept of the    inherent fairness that        318    00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.490    is alive in America    and that here, you        319    00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.650    could aspire and succeed.        320    00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.600    And my parents believed    that their children        321    00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.060    could aspire and succeed    to levels that could not        322    00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.160    have happened anywhere    else in the world.        323    00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.820    And that fairness    that my family and I        324    00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.300    have come to take for    granted-- and all Americans        325    00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.870    take for granted--    is, in many ways,        326    00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.790    resting on your    shoulders to uphold.        327    00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:32.400    You represent those who will    make laws and effect change.        328    00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.314    And that is truly    an amazing thing.        329    00:12:36.314 --> 00:12:38.480    And more than any of the    others graduating this week        330    00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.510    from Harvard, what you decide    to do in the next 5 to 10 years        331    00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.590    will affect the rights    of people in this country        332    00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.490    in a fundamental way.        333    00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.640    I'm now at the part    of my speech where        334    00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.290    I am supposed to    give you advice.        335    00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:55.930    And I thought, what advice    could I give you guys?        336    00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.370    Celebrities give    too much device.        337    00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.470    And people listen    to it too much.        338    00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.310    In Hollywood, we    all think that we        339    00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:03.980    are these wise advice-givers.        340    00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.200    And most of us have no    education whatsoever.        341    00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.170    Actresses can become    nutritionists,        342    00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.130    experts in baby care and    environmental policy.        343    00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:17.270    Actors can become governors,    pundits, or even high-ranking        344    00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.660    officials in religions made up    a mere 60 years ago. [LAUGHS]        345    00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:21.190    [LAUGHTER]        346    00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:23.740    For two years, I have played an    obstetrician and gynecologist        347    00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.660    on TV, and damned if I don't    think I can deliver a baby.        348    00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.960    So then I was    thinking, well then,        349    00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.110    who should be giving advice?        350    00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.240    And the answer is    people like you.        351    00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.530    You're better educated.        352    00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.446    And you're going to go    out there in the world,        353    00:13:38.446 --> 00:13:40.640    and people are going to    listen to what you say,        354    00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.360    whether you're good or evil.        355    00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.283    And that probably scares you.        356    00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:47.810    Because some of you    look really young.        357    00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:49.040    [LAUGHTER]        358    00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.220    And I'm afraid a couple    of you are probably evil.        359    00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.145    That's just the odds.        360    00:13:53.145 --> 00:13:54.160    [LAUGHTER]        361    00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.810    And to be honest, it scares me.        362    00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.480    Because you look like    a bunch of tweens.        363    00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.604    I mean, this is ridiculous.        364    00:13:58.604 --> 00:14:01.140    Look at these kids    in these suits.        365    00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.270    So please, just try to be the    kind of people that give advice        366    00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.350    to celebrities, not    the other way around.        367    00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:08.500    You are entering a    profession where,        368    00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.980    no matter how bad the    crime or the criminal,        369    00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:15.150    you have to defend the    alleged perpetrator.        370    00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.250    That's incredible to me.        371    00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.730    Across the campus, Harvard    Business School graduates        372    00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:19.730    are receiving diplomas.        373    00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:23.270    And you will need to defend    them for insider trading,        374    00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.750    or possession of    narcotics, or maybe both        375    00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.990    if Wolf of Wall    Street is to believed.        376    00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:32.100    And the thing I find    most fascinating        377    00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.600    is that you are responsible    for the language of justice,        378    00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.830    for the careful and    precise wording,        379    00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.610    and all those boring    contracts that I        380    00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.530    sign while I watch    Real Housewives.        381    00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:44.790    You wrote the terms    and conditions        382    00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.100    that I scroll through    quickly while I        383    00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.700    download the update    for Candy Crush.        384    00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.990    Terms and conditions    are the only things        385    00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.580    keeping us from the    purge, everybody.        386    00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:55.460    I don't read them.        387    00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.170    I just hit Accept.        388    00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.760    iTunes may own my    ovaries, for all I know.        389    00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.360    [LAUGHTER]        390    00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.140    ""Employees must wash their

find just so admirable.        403    00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.220    You take words,    and you turn them        404    00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.220    into the infrastructure    that keeps our

   00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.730    It's back-breaking.        410    00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.200    And often, there's    not much glory in it.        411    00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.720    And in that way,    a lot of you will        412    00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.600    become the quiet    heroes of our country.        413    00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.010    However, those of    you who go

00:00:46.900    is here-- but for the    parents, I think, especially.        13    00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.040    And not just for the    graduates' parents,        14    00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.840    it turns out that my    own parents are here.        15    00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.580    My mom and dad are    seated in the third row.        16    00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.212    You can clap for my parents.        17    00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.279    So a few months    ago, my dad calls me        18    00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:05.820    when he sees the announcement    that Harvard Law School put out        19    00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.360    about the program.        20    00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.000    And he tells me that he and Mom    were going to come up for it.        21    00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000    And I say to him, ""Dad,    look, I'm really touched.        22    00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.610    But you don't have to drive    all the way up from New Jersey.        23    00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.260    You just had knee    surgery--it's a long haul.        24    00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.960    It's fine, Dad.        25    00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.560    Again, I'm touched, but    don't worry about it.""        26    00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.910    My dad gets all serious    and he says to me, ""Preet.        27    00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:37.100    How could I not come and    miss a once in a lifetime        28    00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.950    chance-- once in    a lifetime chance        29    00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.428

Mindy's parents    are here to see me.        33    00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.110    So yes, we've got two    Indian Americans today        34    00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.389    for the price of one.        35    00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:13.009    Apparently, it's India    Day at Harvard Law School.        36    00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:15.550    I hope that you enjoy the Lamb    Vindaloo and the Chicken Tikka        37    00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.925    Masala that will    be served after.        38    00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.880    Not to belabor the    point, but I am        39    00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.640    curious about how the decision    making process worked.        40    00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.547    Like, how did that    meeting go exactly?        41    00:02:28.547 --> 00:02:31.130    I imagine these guys, your class    marshals, were sitting around        42    00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.900    and someone says, ""we got the    US Attorney, Preet Bharara,        43    00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.650    is coming, and then another    class marshals said, ""what,        44    00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.180    you know-- I was just thinking,    as long as we're going Indian,        45    00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.840    maybe we should    have a funny Indian?        46    00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.780    You know.""        47    00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.900    Again, don't get me wrong,    I love the Mindy Kaling,        48    00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.210    but I can't help but get    the feeling that Harvard was        49    00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.410    a little concerned,    asking themselves,        50    00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.830    ""can Bharara really    carry the whole program?""        51    00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.010    And obviously, it    determined, no.        52    00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.810    So, you know, I'm a little hurt,    because I did some research,        53    00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.835    and I understand that    two years ago, you        54    00:03:09.835 --> 00:03:12.580    asked Attorney    General Eric Holder        55    00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.370    to be your class day speaker.        56    00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.490    Apparently you did not feel the    need to also invite Chris Rock.        57    00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.680    And last year-- and last    year, you had Jeffrey Toobin,        58    00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.330    and you did not hedge your    bets with Jerry Seinfeld.        59    00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.310    So I'm just, I'm just saying--    but it's OK, I will do my best.        60    00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.420    I'll do the best that I can.        61    00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.460    It really is, though,    an honor to be here.        62    00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.120    I have had an unexpectedly    productive trip so far.        63    00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.670    I arrived last evening,    stopped by the Business School,        64    00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.350    dropped off a    couple of subpoenas,        65    00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.330    arrested three guys    for insider trading,        66    00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.920    and finished off the evening    sipping a scorpion bowl,        67    00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.510    at the Kong.        68    00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:06.210    By the way, I hope you've gotten    to know your Business School        69    00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.270    colleagues, because they--    they are your future clients.        70    00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.570    So anyway, I'm sitting at the    Hong Kong restaurant, which        71    00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.620    I will note, has changed, like    not at all in the 24 years        72    00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.110    since I used to be    a regular patron        73    00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.640    when I was in the college.        74    00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.560    And so I'm sipping    the scorpion bowl        75    00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.600    through that ridiculous kiddie    straw that they give you,        76    00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.530    and reviewing my    prepared text for today,        77    00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.730    which was replete    with lofty quotations        78    00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.870    from Oliver Wendell    Holmes and Felix        79    00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.050    Frankfurter and, of    course, one Mr. Langdell.        80    00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.130    And then I had what people    call a moment of clarity.        81    00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.190    That will happen to you when    you drink a scorpion bowl.        82    00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.990    And the moment of    clarity was this,        83    00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.480    you don't really want or    need me to read and quote        84    00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.300    from legal scripture.        85    00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.050    Not on Class Day, at    least, and especially        86    00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.487    when you haven't even    given us caps and gowns.        87    00:04:59.487 --> 00:05:01.070    So instead, what I    thought I would do,        88    00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.090    is rather than speak    esoterically about the law,        89    00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.320    I would speak more    pragmatically about how        90    00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.610    to be successful and    happy in law practice.        91    00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.680    Now that is not so    easy as it sounds--        92    00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.950    to be both successful    and happy as a lawyer.        93    00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.170    You may be asking    yourself, what should I        94    00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.530    be focused on my first job?        95    00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.360    Pleasing the partner?        96    00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.740    Should I be networking?        97    00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.940    Getting clients?        98    00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.940    Setting myself up    for the next job?        99    00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.460    A simple and excellent answer    is actually provided by a scene        100    00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.980    from one of the greatest    Martin Scorsese movies made--        101    00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.880    it's called The Departed.        102    00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.630    If you haven't seen    it, you should see it.        103    00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.530    It's set around here    in the Boston area,        104    00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.840    and it's loosely based on    notorious mobster Whitey        105    00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.440    Bulger.        106    00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.240    So you can see why I    might like this film.        107    00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.270    Mark Wahlberg is in the    movie, and he plays a cop.        108    00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.490    And there's a scene where    a law enforcement officer--        109    00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.960    operation goes south, and    Wahlberg's character is upset        110    00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.750    and he starts asking questions.        111    00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.530    And somebody says to    Wahlberg, who the ""F"" are you?        112    00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.220    And Wahlberg says, ""I'm    the guy who does his job,        113    00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.610    you must be the other guy.""        114    00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.200    And I submit that there is    more wise career counsel        115    00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.340    in that short scene,    that in many volumes        116    00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.040    that you might read.        117    00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.370    Because that is where    your focus should always        118    00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.720    be-- being the guy who does    his job-- whether you're        119    00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.690    an associate, a law clerk, an    assistant DA, a public defender        120    00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.450    or anything else.        121    00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.390    Nothing else matters,    but doing your job        122    00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.460    and doing it well every    day, even when it's hard,        123    00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.570    even when it's tedious,    even when it's dull,        124    00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.350    even when the work seems small    and beneath your brand name        125    00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.480    schooling and god-given talent.        126    00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.010    It means being the guy    who does his job even when        127    00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.870    no one is looking    and no one will        128    00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.930    know the good ideas    came from you.        129    00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:00.000    If you do that, not only the    next job but your entire career        130    00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.670    will take care of itself.        131    00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.570    Trust me on that.        132    00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.780    Let me put it a different    way, almost exactly four years        133    00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.310    ago today, Philadelphia    Phillies pitcher, Roy Halladay,        134    00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.900    achieved one of the most    rare and difficult things        135    00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.790    in all of sports.        136    00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.300    He pitched a perfect game.        137    00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:24.220    Nine innings, no hits,    no walks, 27 up, 27 down.        138    00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.690    He was perfect.        139    00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.990    And he is in the history    books because of it.        140    00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.030    Then, four months later, on    October 6th of that year,        141    00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.340    in the very same    season, Halladay        142    00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.920    threw a no-hitter-- not quite    perfect, but pretty darn close.        143    00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.470    He did it, by the way,    in a playoff game.        144    00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.840    In all of baseball    history, only two people        145    00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.080    have ever thrown a no-hitter    in the post season.        146    00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.720    Just two.        147    00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.570    The Phillies pitching    coach was asked        148    00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.490    by a reporter what advice    he had given his Ace.        149    00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.520    And the coach said    that he'd given        150    00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.070    Roy Halladay a    simple instruction.        151    00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.790    He said ""go out there    and try to be good.        152    00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.070    If you just go out there    and try to be good,        153    00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.270    you've got a chance    to be great.""        154    00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.270    And that is literally the    best advice I have ever heard.        155    00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:17.130    It has stayed with me, and    I hope it stays with you.        156    00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.570    I think there is a tendency    for people like you        157    00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.760    who are so successful and    so accomplished and so        158    00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.140    credentialed, to think every    endeavor is like a baseball        159    00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.870    game in which you're going to    go out and pitch a perfect game.        160    00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.340    But it doesn't work that way.        161    00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.880    You should have    high aspirations.        162    00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.669    You should want to be    monumentally successful.        163    00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:41.390    But you've got to do    it one pitch at a time.        164    00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:46.670    It sounds cliche, but you've got    to do it one pitch at a time.        165    00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.320    Pitch, after pitch,    after pitch-- that's        166    00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.310    what develops into    a perfect game,        167    00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.810    or by analogy, an    outstanding career.        168    00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.930    And by the way, no one who    ever pitched a perfect game        169    00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:04.190    in baseball went to the mound    that day expecting to do so.        170    00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.995    Because not only is    that unrealistic,        171    00:09:05.995 --> 00:09:08.200    it is the height of arrogance.        172    00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.610    And yet I see people all the    time make that very mistake.        173    00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:16.730    They want to be great before    they've learned how to be good.        174    00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.440    They want to be    on the big matter,        175    00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.970    before they've    handled a small one.        176    00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.500    They want to try a case before    they've argued a motion.        177    00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.090    They want to be generals before    they have been good soldiers.        178    00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.390    But first, I submit, you have    to learn some craft-- actually        179    00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:38.140    learn how to practice law in    whatever area you first pick.        180    00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.560    Craft and competence will always    matter more than connections.        181    00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.220    But in a lot of    places, people often        182    00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.750    behave in a way that    suggests the reverse is true.        183    00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.020    So learn some craft.        184    00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.060    You'll stumble.        185    00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.450    It won't always go great.        186    00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.290    It didn't for me.        187    00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:56.890    I remember the first major    deposition I ever took,        188    00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.210    I couldn't figure out how    to ask a proper question.        189    00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.420    It got so bad, that the    adversary asked for a break        190    00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.170    and then apologized    to the court reporter.        191    00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.730    And I didn't understand what    he was apologizing about.        192    00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.560    And I realized he was    apologizing for me.        193    00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.050    So that kind of    hurt a little bit.        194    00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.500    I never forgot that.        195    00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.900    But I got better.        196    00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.250    And you will, too.        197    00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.440    And once you have learned your    craft, and learned it well,        198    00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.570    you will be in    good stead always.        199    00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:27.110    And I guarantee, you will be    swimming in opportunities.        200    00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.320    Let's talk about    humility for a moment.        201    00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.760    Humility, I think,    is underrepresented        202    00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.730    and undervalued in law    practice, which is too bad.        203    00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.910    So why is humility important?        204    00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.890    Mostly, so you don't    become unbearable.        205    00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.540    And also, because it    will keep you open-minded        206    00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.190    and striving to    always do better.        207    00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.920    So find someone in your life    who will help keep you humble.        208    00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.920    Luckily, I have an    abundance of those people        209    00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.730    in my own life-- my    daughter, for example.        210    00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.300    A quick true story,    she is now 13,        211    00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.570    but three years ago, we had    just won a big white collar case        212    00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.594    and there was a nice profile    about her dad in the New York        213    00:11:06.594 --> 00:11:09.010    Times, and I thought, ""I should    have my daughter read this        214    00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.150    so she can be proud of Dad.""        215    00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.360    So she begrudgingly read    the article and at the end,        216    00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.880    I recall, that it ends    with a quote for me that's        217    00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.920    very sort of finger-waggy    and chest-thumpy about        218    00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.720    how we're not going    to stop fighting        219    00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.000    against Wall Street crime.        220    00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.255    So my daughter finishes    reading the article,        221    00:11:26.255 --> 00:11:28.630    looks up, and I'm waiting to    see what my daughter's going        222    00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.730    to say, and how proud    she is of her father.        223    00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.080    And she said, rolling    her eyes slightly,        224    00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.210    and this is a direct    quote-- ""Daddy,        225    00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:40.920    why are you such a drama queen?""        226    00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.340    So be sure you have people    like that in your life.        227    00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.380    If you don't, my    daughter is available.        228    00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.270    A part of humility,    by the way, is        229    00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.220    becoming comfortable    with self-doubt.        230    00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.594    It took me awhile    to appreciate this.        231    00:11:55.594 --> 00:11:58.010    You'd think when I became the    US Attorney for the Southern        232    00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.630    District of New York,    a storied institutions        233    00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.990    in 1789, that I said to    myself, ""well it's about time.        234    00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:08.840    Finally, I can fix 220 years    of inferior leadership.""        235    00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.430    No, not quite.        236    00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:15.100    Here's how I did feel-- I    felt nervous, and afraid,        237    00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.540    and unworthy.        238    00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.650    I was terrified that    I might not live up        239    00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:21.450    to the tradition of    that great place,        240    00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:24.520    that I might not ultimately    measure up to the job,        241    00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.010    that I would be a    disappointment to the people who        242    00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:28.570    had supported me.        243    00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.720    There's 100 years of    US Attorneys portraits        244    00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.730    on the hallway wall    leading up to my office.        245    00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.550    And I walk by them    every day, and they        246    00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.670    appear to be telling me every    morning, ""don't screw it up,        247    00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.090    kid.""        248    00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.680    And so even now, after    almost five years        249    00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:48.600    that have gone pretty well, I    get nervous and afraid still.        250    00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.710    And if I ever lose    that feeling, I        251    00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.259    think that's the day    that I should step down.        252    00:12:54.259 --> 00:12:55.050    Don't get me wrong.        253    00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.270    I do have self-confidence also.        254    00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:01.810    But at the same time, and    on a fairly frequent basis,        255    00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.820    roaring self-doubt.        256    00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:08.360    But you'll find that    self-doubt in moderation        257    00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.300    is animating and    motivating, not paralyzing.        258    00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.170    In my view, leaders    who have purged        259    00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.560    themselves of all    self-doubt will not        260    00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.490    be leaders for long,    and in my view,        261    00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:21.730    are dangerous while in command.        262    00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.080    I've learned over    time that self-doubt        263    00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.742    is my friend and    arrogance my enemy.        264    00:13:27.742 --> 00:13:29.200    Now let's talk    about something that        265    00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.450    will bring you down    from time to time.        266    00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.570    It's called criticism.        267    00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.950    So brace yourself, because you    will receive it-- especially        268    00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:40.270    if you rise high, or take    a stand on something.        269    00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:41.370    And it will hurt.        270    00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.307    It will even sting.        271    00:13:43.307 --> 00:13:45.390    Now there are some people    in the world who are not        272    00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.850    bothered by criticism,    for whom everything just        273    00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.820    rolls right off their back.        274    00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.740    Those are Type B people.        275    00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.290    But criticism will    bother you a lot        276    00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.324    because you are Type A people.        277    00:13:56.324 --> 00:13:58.240    And I know what you guys    are like, because I'm        278    00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.890    a little bit that way myself.        279    00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:04.340    You are the kind of people who    are super competitive, even        280    00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.390    when playing board    games with children.        281    00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.725    By the way, there's    nothing wrong with that.        282    00:14:11.725 --> 00:14:12.780    A kid's gotta learn.        283    00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.560    The key, I think, to    learn, is to learn        284    00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.290    which criticism to take to    heart to make yourself better        285    00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.300    and to improve, and which    criticism to laugh off,        286    00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.502    which criticism is well    placed, and which is foolish.        287    00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:31.960    Trust me, I've    gotten to know a lot        288    00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.250    about criticism in this job.        289    00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.340    Sometimes, just doing your    job and doing the right thing        290    00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.970    will provoke criticism.        291    00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.570    I've been criticized    from the left.        292    00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.130    I've been criticized    from the right.        293    00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.990    I've been criticized    by various governments.        294    00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.600    I've been banned from Russia.        295    00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.240    That's true.        296    00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.730    Sometimes, criticism    is valid and you        297    00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:53.530    have to take it seriously    and be smart about it.        298    00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:57.370    The point is, don't be    dismissive about criticism,        299    00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.070    but be discerning about it.        300    00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:00.422    Here's another quick story.        301    00:15:00.422 --> 00:15:01.880    So you may have    heard, some of you,        302    00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.790    about a case we brought    last year in which the State        303    00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:10.075    Department arrested a mid-level    Indian diplomat female, Devyani        304    00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:13.980    Khobragade, for visa fraud in    connection with lies about she        305    00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.560    would ultimately pay    her domestic worker.        306    00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.280    Not the crime of the    century, but a serious crime        307    00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.580    nonetheless.        308    00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.940    That's why the State    Department opened the case.        309    00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.460    That's why the State    Department investigated it.        310    00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.180    That's why the career agents    in the State Department        311    00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.850    asked career    prosecutors in my office        312    00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:34.570    to approve criminal charges.        313    00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:38.290    So that case basically caused    an international incident.        314    00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:42.050    Now putting aside disputes    about the merits of the case,        315    00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.450    somehow the Indian government    and the Indian press        316    00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.570    decided that the    case was brought        317    00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.850    by me, an Indian-American,    for all manner        318    00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:52.460    of bad personal reasons.        319    00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.360    Never mind that the case was    initiated and investigated        320    00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.484    by career law    enforcement officials,        321    00:15:57.484 --> 00:15:59.150    and that I became    personally aware of it        322    00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:03.190    only a day or two before the    arrest had been scheduled.        323    00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.520    Talk show host in India    took to calling me        324    00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.950    a self-loathing Indian,    who made it a point        325    00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.710    to go after people from    the country of his birth.        326    00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:17.600    Which was a bit odd, since the    alleged victim was also Indian.        327    00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.700    An Indian official    basically asked        328    00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.960    on television, who the    hell is Preet Bharara?        329    00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.737    And the criticism got    increasingly intense        330    00:16:25.737 --> 00:16:27.570    over time-- which might    not have bothered me        331    00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:31.370    so much, except that it    bothered my parents, who        332    00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:35.430    came from India to    this country as adults.        333    00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.874    And that was tough,    because it bothered them.        334    00:16:37.874 --> 00:16:39.290    And then it bothered    me again when        335    00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.800    I had to explain    to my daughter, who        336    00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.960    overheard a conversation in    the house, of what it meant        337    00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.300    to be called an Uncle Tom--    because that's what I was being        338    00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.060    called by journalists    in South Asia.        339    00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.950    So that was not so pleasant.        340    00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.630    And I will admit    that I was upset,        341    00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.570    as I think the normal    human being might be.        342    00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.830    But then as the accusations    got more and more absurd,        343    00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.580    they became downright    comical, and I        344    00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.290    got some of my perspective back.        345    00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.859    After all, Indian    critics were angry        346    00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.130    because even though    I hail from India,        347    00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.329    I appear to be    going out of my way        348    00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:18.290    to act American and serve the    interests of America, which        349    00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.530    was also kind of odd    because I am American,        350    00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:25.940    and the words United States    are actually in my title.        351    00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.090    And then I saw this line of    attack in the foreign press,        352    00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.400    and in Syria's    press, it was written        353    00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.810    that Bharara had    undertaken this case        354    00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:38.500    to quote, ""serve his    white masters,"" presumably        355    00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.775    Eric Holder and Barack Obama.        356    00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:48.120    So you get my point.        357    00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:53.060    So that is an example of    criticism that is stupid.        358    00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.080    And I realized,    by the way, that I        359    00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.370    had a ready response to the    Indian official who asked,        360    00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:00.240    who the hell is Preet Bharara?        361    00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.910    And it's this-- ""I'm the    guy who does his job.        362    00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.960    You must be the other guy.""        363    00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.830    A couple of final    general points.        364    00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.340    Work for good people.        365    00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.450    Don't work for jerks, no    matter how smart and talented        366    00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:15.850    you think they are.        367    00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.140    And don't be a jerk yourself.        368    00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.120    Also, while you're making    your career happen,        369    00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.480    you're allowed to have fun,    even if the job at hand        370    00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.720    is deadly serious.        371    00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.630    We have fun at the    US Attorney's Office,        372    00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:28.810    because we never take    ourselves too seriously.        373    00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.230    I think that's important.        374    00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.990    Humorlessness correlates    directly with pomposity,        375    00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:38.000    and I believe,    also with failure.        376    00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.380    So now I realize that    a lot of this advice        377    00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.680    seems not unique to    the practice of law.        378    00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.410    Well there's a reason for that.        379    00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.020    The practice of law is a    lot like any other endeavor        380    00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.210    in life.        381    00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:52.150    It can be messy, and    difficult, and stressful,        382    00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:55.880    but the most important    advice is the same.        383    00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.410    Do your job and be humble.        384    00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:02.300    Work for good people and be    good to those who work for you.        385    00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.580    Accept criticism,    unless it's foolish.        386    00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.660    Have fun and embrace humor.        387    00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.600    Like other endeavors,    the practice of law        388    00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.400    is about each pitch-- about    going out there and trying        389    00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.890    to be good every day    instead of trying        390    00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.270    to pitch a perfect    game on your first try.        391    00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.240    But I do want to conclude    with a thought that        392    00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.780    is particular to    the practice of law,        393    00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:28.300    especially for a Harvard    Law School graduate.        394    00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.780    And it's this-- the    degree you're receiving        395    00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.750    is a precious and powerful gift.        396    00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.790    Yes, I know you have    worked very hard,        397    00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:39.350    but it is a gift nonetheless.        398    00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.000    So don't squander it.        399    00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.840    There are people who would    give a limb for the gift        400    00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.290    that you are getting this week.        401    00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:49.310    And you should be exceptionally    proud of the career        402    00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.830    that you have chosen.        403    00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.430    Now, I know that not    everyone loves lawyers,        404    00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:57.200    and I know that we lawyers    are, as a group, much maligned.        405    00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:02.130    But I continue to believe in the    quaint and uncommon view, that        406    00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:06.280    to become a lawyer is to    join a noble profession.        407    00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.070    I continue to believe also, that    there is no one better situated        408    00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:14.670    to prevent cruelty, promote    equality, and preserve liberty,        409    00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:16.680    than the person    who has genuinely        410    00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.220    dedicated himself or herself    to becoming both a master        411    00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.030    and a servant of the law.        412    00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:24.880    The potential power    of a law degree        413    00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.680    is, I believe, unmatched    in American society.        414    00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.800    No one is better situated    to stand up for an ideal,        415    00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.110    or expose corruption,    or champion underdogs,        416    00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.410    or defend unalienable rights.        417    00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:41.770    I think it is not    an overstatement        418    00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:44.370    to suggest that the    power of your degree        419    00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:46.920    gives you a degree of    power that few possess,        420    00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.900    fewer know how to use,    and fewer still know        421    00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.170    how to put to good purpose.        422    00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:57.430    People spend their entire    lives waiting for the chance        423    00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:01.890    to do something meaningful-- to    make a difference in the world.        424    00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:05.620    For so many people,    too many people,        425    00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.510    that moment never comes.        426    00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:12.390    But you, simply by virtue    of your new law degree,        427    00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:15.370    from Harvard no less,    will have that opportunity        428    00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.930    every single day.        429    00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:20.950    And I hope and pray    that you will seize it.        430    00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:24.281    The world needs you to seize it.        431    00:21:24.281 --> 00:21:26.280    Now, I was trying to make    it through this speech        432    00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.405    without quoting anyone more    distinguished than Mark        433    00:21:28.405 --> 00:21:32.390    Wahlberg, but I saw--    and maybe some of you        434    00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:35.230    have not seen the sad    news this morning--        435    00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.850    that beloved American author    and poet, Maya Angelou,        436    00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:40.660    had passed away.        437    00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:44.550    And though she is gone, her    words will always be with us.        438    00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:47.220    And among the very    many beautiful words        439    00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.870    she has strung together    where these-- ""I've learned        440    00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.560    that you shouldn't go    through life with a catcher's        441    00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.560    mitt on both hands.        442    00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:01.670    You need to be able to    throw something back.""        443    00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:06.000    So please, go out there    and just try to be good.        444    00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.130    Do it one pitch at a time.        445    00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.780    And don't forget to    throw something back.        446    00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.470    The world is waiting    for all of you.        447    00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:15.170    Good luck.

    40    00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.640    do something really special for you I        41    00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.160    wanted to be able to have you look under        42    00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.680    your seats and there would be        43    00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.560    free free uh uh master and Doctor        44    00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.400    degrees but I see        45    00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.440    I see you got that covered        46    00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.400    already I will be honest with you I felt        47    00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.239    a lot of pressure over the past few        48    00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.599    weeks to come up with something that I        49    00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.879    could share with you that you hadn't        50    00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.080    heard before because after all y'all        51    00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.040    went to Harvard I did not but then I        52    00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.519    realized that you don't have to        53    00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.879    necessarily go to Harvard to have a        54    00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.760    driven obsessive type A        55    00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.680    personality but it helps and while I may        56    00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.159    not have graduated from here I admit        57    00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.560    that my personality is about as Harvard        58    00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.480    as they come you know my my television        59    00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.720    career began        60    00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.599    unexpectedly uh as you heard this        61    00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.400    morning I was in the misfire prevention        62    00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.319    contest that was when I was 16 years old        63    00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.480    in Nashville Tennessee and you had the        64    00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.440    requirement of having to have red hair        65    00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.959    in order to win up until the year that I        66    00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.840    entered so they were doing the question        67    00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.360    and answer period cuz I knew I wasn't        68    00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.680    going to win in the swimsuit competition        69    00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.280    so during the question and answer period        70    00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.920    the question came why young lady what        71    00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.959    would you like to be when you grow up        72    00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.920    and by the time they got to me all the        73    00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.720    good answers were        74    00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.000    gone so I had seen Barbara Walters on        75    00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000    The Today Show that morning so I        76    00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.400    answered I would like to be a        77    00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.959    journalist I would like to tell other        78    00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.840    people's stories in a way that makes a        79    00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.319    difference in their lives and the world        80    00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.439    and as those words were coming out of my        81    00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:07.680    mouth I went whoa this is pretty        82    00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.200    good I would like to be a journalist I        83    00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.239    want to make a difference well I was on        84    00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.479    television by the time I was 19 years        85    00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.720    old and in 1986 I launched my own        86    00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.160    television show with a Relentless        87    00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.800    determination to succeed at first I was        88    00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.600    nervous about the competition and then I        89    00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.400    became my own competition        90    00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.000    raising the bar every year pushing        91    00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.440    pushing pushing myself as hard as I knew        92    00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.120    sound familiar to anybody here        93    00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.199    eventually we did make it to the top and        94    00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.960    we stayed there for        95    00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.960    25        96    00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.000    years the Oprah winre show was number        97    00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.120    one in our time slot for 21 years and I        98    00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.360    have to tell you I became pretty        99    00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.360    comfortable with that level of success        100    00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.919    but a few years ago I decided as you        101    00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.000    will at some point that it was time to        102    00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.240    recalculate find new territory break new        103    00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.479    ground so I ended the show and launched        104    00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.240    own the OA Winfrey Network the initials        105    00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.080    just worked out for me so one year        106    00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.639    later after launching on nearly every        107    00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.560    media Outlet had proclaimed that that my        108    00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.840    new Venture was a flop not just a flop        109    00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.000    but a big bold flop they call it I can        110    00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.880    still remember the day I opened up USA        111    00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.039    Today and read the headline Oprah not        112    00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.759    quite standing on her        113    00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:49.520    own I mean really USA Today now that's        114    00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.120    the nice        115    00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.360    newspaper it it it really was this time        116    00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.440    last year the worst period in my        117    00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.880    professional life I was stressed and I        118    00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.520    was frustrated and quite frankly I was I        119    00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.680    was actually I was        120    00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.080    embarrassed it was right around that        121    00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.280    time that President F called and asked        122    00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.440    me to speak here and I thought you want        123    00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.400    me to speak to Harvard graduates what I        124    00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.160    what could I possibly say to Harvard        125    00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.080    graduate some of the most successful        126    00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.000    graduates in the world in the very        127    00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.840    moment when I had stopped        128    00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.319    succeeding so I got off the phone with        129    00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:39.080    President F and I went to the shower it        130    00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.639    was either that or a bag of        131    00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.840    Oreos so I chose the        132    00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.560    shower and I was in the shower a long        133    00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.840    time and as I was in the shower the        134    00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.720    words of an old hymn came to me you may        135    00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.280    not know it it's by and        136    00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.160    by when the morning comes and I started        137    00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.680    thinking about when the morning might        138    00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.680    come cuz at the time I thought I was        139    00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.120    stuck in a        140    00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.280    hole and the words came to me trouble        141    00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.800    trouble don't last always from that hymn        142    00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.800    this too shall pass and I thought as I        143    00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.479    got out of the shower I am going to turn        144    00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:21.440    this thing around and I will be better        145    00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.680    for it and when I do I'm going to go to        146    00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.759    Harvard and I'm going to speak the truth        147    00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:29.919    of it so I'm here today to tell you I I        148    00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:34.160    have turned that Network        149    00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.080    around and it was all because I wanted        150    00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.639    to do it by the time I got to speak to        151    00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:47.440    you all so thank you so much you don't        152    00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.639    know what motivation you were for me        153    00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:52.919    thank you I'm even prouder to share a        154    00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:54.919    fundamental truth that you might not        155    00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:57.360    have learned even as graduates of        156    00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.159    Harvard unless you studied uh the        157    00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:04.199    ancient Greek hero with Professor        158    00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:07.159    NJ Professor NJ who as we were coming in        159    00:08:07.159 --> 00:08:09.120    this morning said please miss Winfrey        160    00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.400    walk        161    00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.080    decisively I shall walk        162    00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.360    decisively this is what I want to        163    00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.919    share it doesn't matter how far you        164    00:08:20.919 --> 00:08:24.599    might rise at some point you are bound        165    00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:27.080    to stumble because if you're constantly        166    00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.400    doing what we do raising the bar if you        167    00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.880    are constantly pushing yourself higher        168    00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.640    higher the law of averages not to        169    00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.560    mention the myth of vigorous uh predicts        170    00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.599    that you will at some point fall and        171    00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:45.760    when you do I want you to know this        172    00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.880    remember this there is no such thing as        173    00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.760    failure failure is just life trying to        174    00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.320    move us in another Direction now when        175    00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.839    you're down there in a hole it looks        176    00:08:56.839 --> 00:08:57.839    like        177    00:08:57.839 --> 00:09:01.160    failure so this past year I had to spoon        178    00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.040    feed those words to        179    00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.640    myself and when you're down in the hole        180    00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.839    when that moment comes it's really okay        181    00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:10.720    to feel bad for a little while give        182    00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.760    yourself time to mourn what you think        183    00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.480    you may have lost but then here's the        184    00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.399    key learn from every mistake because        185    00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:25.560    every experience encounter and        186    00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.920    particularly your mistakes are there to        187    00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.680    teach you and force you into being more        188    00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.240    of who you are and then figure out what        189    00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.440    is the next right move and the key to        190    00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.560    life is to develop an internal moral        191    00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.240    emotional GPS that can tell you which        192    00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.279    way to go because now and forever more        193    00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:52.920    when you Google        194    00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.399    yourself your search results will read        195    00:09:56.399 --> 00:10:00.399    Harvard 2013        196    00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.360    and in a very competitive world that        197    00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.240    really is a calling card cuz I can tell        198    00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.079    you as one who employs a lot of people        199    00:10:09.079 --> 00:10:10.760    when I see Harvard I sit up a little        200    00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.079    straight and say where is he or she        201    00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:15.399    bring them        202    00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:18.040    in it's an impressive calling card that        203    00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.800    can lead even more impressive bullets in        204    00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.360    the years ahead lawyer Senator CEO        205    00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.279    scientists physicists winners of Nobel        206    00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:29.920    and Pulitzer prizes or late late night

build a resume that doesn't        210    00:10:40.839 --> 00:10:44.240    simply tell a story about what you want        211    00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.920    to be but it's a story about who you        212    00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.519    want to be it's a resume that doesn't        213    00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:51.600    just tell a story about what you want to        214    00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.880    accomplish but why a story that's not        215    00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.560    just a collection of titles and and        216    00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.760    positions but a story that's really        217    00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.120    about your purpose because when you        218    00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.040    inevitably stumble and find yourself        219    00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.560    stuck in a hole that is the story that        220    00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.440    will get you out what is your true        221    00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.800    calling what is your Dharma what is your        222    00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.440    purpose for me that Discovery came in        223    00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.639    1994 when I interviewed a little girl        224    00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:24.959    who who had decided to collect Pocket        225    00:11:24.959 --> 00:11:27.800    Change in order to help other people in        226    00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.680    need she raised a $1,000 all by herself        227    00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.600    and I thought well if that little        228    00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.880    9-year-old girl with a bucket and a big        229    00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.360    heart could do that I wonder what I        230    00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.800    could do so I ask for our viewers to        231    00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.000    take up their own change collection and        232    00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.880    in one month just from pennies and        233    00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.800    Nicholls and dimes we raised more than        234    00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.680    $3 million that we use to send one        235    00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.480    student from every state in the United        236    00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.639    States to college that was the beginning        237    00:11:54.639 --> 00:11:59.200    of the Angel Network        238    00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.720    and so what I did was I simply asked our        239    00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.279    viewers do what you can wherever you are        240    00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:09.360    from wherever you sit in life give me        241    00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.399    your time or your talent your money if        242    00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:16.160    you have it and they did extend yourself        243    00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.920    in kindness to other human beings        244    00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.600    wherever you can and together we built        245    00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.279    55 schools in 12 different countries and        246    00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:27.959    restored nearly 300 homes that were        247    00:12:27.959 --> 00:12:31.120    devastated by Hurricane Rita and Katrina        248    00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.480    so The Angel Network I've been on the        249    00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.399    air for a long time but it was The Angel        250    00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:40.240    Network that actually focused my        251    00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.800    internal GPS it helped me to decide that        252    00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.079    I wasn't just going to be on TV every        253    00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:49.720    day but that the goal of my shows my        254    00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.240    interviews my business my philanthropy        255    00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.000    all of it whatever Ventures I might        256    00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.959    pursue would be to make clear that what        257    00:12:59.959 --> 00:13:04.320    unites us is ultimately far more        258    00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.000    redeeming and compelling than anything        259    00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.079    that separates me because what had        260    00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:11.279    become clear to me and I want you to        261    00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:13.079    know it isn't always clear in the        262    00:13:13.079 --> 00:13:15.440    beginning because as I said I'd been on        263    00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.079    television since I was 19 years old but        264    00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:22.519    around 94 I got really clear so don't        265    00:13:22.519 --> 00:13:24.519    expect the clarity to come all at once        266    00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:27.000    to know your purpose right away but what        267    00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.480    became clear to me was that I I was here        268    00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.000    on Earth to use television and not be        269    00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.720    used by it to use television to        270    00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.639    illuminate the Transcendent power of our        271    00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:41.639    better        272    00:13:41.639 --> 00:13:45.279    Angels so this Angel Network it didn't        273    00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:47.920    just change the lives of those who were        274    00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.759    helped but the lives of those who also        275    00:13:50.759 --> 00:13:53.680    did the helping it reminded us that no        276    00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.759    matter who we are or what we look like        277    00:13:56.759 --> 00:13:59.880    or what we may believe it is both        278    00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.839    possible and more importantly it it        279    00:14:02.839 --> 00:14:05.959    becomes powerful to come together in        280    00:14:05.959 --> 00:14:07.959    common purpose and common        281    00:14:07.959 --> 00:14:11.000    effort I saw something on a bill Moore        282    00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.920    Show recently that so reminded me of        283    00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.279    this point it was an interview with        284    00:14:16.279 --> 00:14:18.320    David and Francine        285    00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.880    wheeler they lost their seven-year-old        286    00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.720    son Ben in the Sandy Hook tragedy and        287    00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.000    even though gun safety legislation to        288    00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.240    strengthen background checks had just        289    00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.000    voted down in Congress at the time that        290    00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.079    they were doing this interview they        291    00:14:33.079 --> 00:14:38.519    talked about how they refused to be        292    00:14:38.519 --> 00:14:42.759    discouraged Francine said this she said        293    00:14:42.759 --> 00:14:44.959    our hearts are        294    00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:48.680    broken but our Spirits are not I'm going        295    00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.480    to tell them what it's like to find a        296    00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.040    conversation about change that is love        297    00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.639    and I'm going to do that without        298    00:14:56.639 --> 00:14:59.399    fighting them and then her husband David        299    00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:00.480    added        300    00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.399    this you simply cannot demonize or        301    00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:07.320    vilify someone who doesn't agree with        302    00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.959    you because the minute you do that your        303    00:15:09.959 --> 00:15:13.040    discussion is over and we cannot do that        304    00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.040    any longer the problem is too enormous        305    00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.680    there has to be some way that this        306    00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.639    Darkness can be Banished with light in        307    00:15:23.639 --> 00:15:25.759    our political system and in the media we        308    00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:29.519    often see the reflection of a country        309    00:15:29.519 --> 00:15:33.240    that is polarized that is paralyzed and        310    00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.319    is        311    00:15:35.319 --> 00:15:38.759    self-interested and yet I know you know        312    00:15:38.759 --> 00:15:39.480    the        313    00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.360    truth we all know that we are better        314    00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.440    than the scism and the pessimism that is        315    00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.240    regurgitated throughout Washington and        316    00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.399    the 24-hour cable news cycle not my        317    00:15:52.399 --> 00:15:54.920    channel by the        318    00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:59.079    way we understand that the vast majority        319    00:15:59.079 --> 00:16:00.720    of people in this country believe in        320    00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.720    stronger background checks because they        321    00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.560    realize that we can uphold the Second        322    00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.519    Amendment and also reduce the violence        323    00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:11.680    that is robbing us of our children they        324    00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.319    don't have to be        325    00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.480    incompatible and we understand that most        326    00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.040    Americans believe in a clear path to the        327    00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.920    citizenship for the 12 million        328    00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.920    undocumented immigrants who reside in        329    00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.319    this country because it's possible to        330    00:16:35.319 --> 00:16:37.639    both enforce our        331    00:16:37.639 --> 00:16:41.279    laws and at the same time embrace the        332    00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:43.000    words of the Statue of Liberty that have        333    00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.040    welcomed generations of huddle masses to        334    00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.880    our Shores we can do        335    00:16:53.319 --> 00:16:56.800    both and we understand I know you do cuz        336    00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.440    you went to harbard that people from        337    00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.759    both parties and no party believe that        338    00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:04.079    Indigent mothers and families should        339    00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.919    have access to healthy food and a roof        340    00:17:05.919 --> 00:17:09.160    over their heads and a strong public        341    00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.640    education because here in the richest        342    00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.839    nation on        343    00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:15.600    Earth we can afford a basic level of        344    00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.880    security and opportunity so the question        345    00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.559    is what are we going to do about it        346    00:17:20.559 --> 00:17:23.120    really what are you going to do about it        347    00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.959    maybe you agree with these beliefs maybe        348    00:17:24.959 -->

   when the pundit said they said they        389    00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.919    talked about you they said you'd be too        390    00:19:20.919 --> 00:19:24.280    disappointed you'd be too dejected to        391    00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.960    repeat that same kind of turnout in the        392    00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.400    2012 election and you prove them wrong        393

BS can you say BS at        399    00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.000    Harvard the spin and phoniness and        400    00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.880    artificial nastiness that saturates so        401    00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.520    much of our national debate I know you        402    00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.760    all understand better than most that        403    00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.159    real progress requires        404    00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.360    authentic an authentic way of being        405    00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.799    honesty and above all        406    00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:11.960    empathy I have to say that the single        407    00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.440    most important lesson I learned in 25        408    00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.000    years talking every single day to people        409    00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.120    was that there is a common denominator        410    00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.240    in our Human        411    00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.559    Experience most of us I tell you we        412    00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.799    don't want to be divided        413    00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:31.159    what we want the common denominator that        414    00:20:31.159 --> 00:20:33.960    I found in every single interview is we        415    00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.480    want to be        416    00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.720    validated we want to be understood I've        417    00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.840    done over        418    00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.520    35,000 interviews in my        419    00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.760    career and as soon as that camera shuts        420    00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.840    off everyone always turns to me and        421    00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.679    inevitably in their own way asks this        422    00:20:53.679 --> 00:20:56.840    question was that        423    00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.159    okay I heard it

426    00:21:04.039 --> 00:21:06.280    Housewives I've heard it from victims        427    00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.520    and perpetrators of crimes I even heard        428    00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:12.240    it from Beyonce and all of her        429    00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:15.559    beyonc she finishes performing hands me        430    00:21:15.559 --> 00:21:19.200    the microphone and

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.400    disagree with        444    00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.799    that you'll        445    00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:06.919    have the the the courage to look them in

       465    00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.559    learned long ago that being myself was        466    00:23:10.559 --> 00:23:12.320    much easier than pretending to be        467    00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.799    Barbara        468    00:23:13.799 --> 00:23:16.080    Walters although when I first started        469    00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.840    because I had Barbara in my head I would        470    00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.159    try to sit like Barbara talk like        471    00:23:19.159 --> 00:23:20.760    Barbara move like Barbara and then one        472    00:23:20.760 -->

what makes you come        499    00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.840    alive and then go do that because what        500    00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:46.919    the world needs is people who have come

Lauderdale when Michael was just 8        504    00:24:57.799 --> 00:25:00.159    years old Michael nearly died from a        505    00:25:00.159 --> 00:25:01.840    bacterial infection that cost him both        506    00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.799    of his hands and both of his feet and in        507    00:25:04.799 --> 00:25:06.720    an instant this vibrant little boy        508    00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:11.120    became a quadruple amputee and his life        509    00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.720    was changed forever but in Los losing        510    00:25:14.720 -->

wheelchair all day and feel sorry        513    00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.960    for himself so with prosthetics he        514    00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.399    learned to walk and run and play again        515    00:25:30.399 --> 00:25:32.399    he joined his Middle School lacrosse        516    00:25:32.399 --> 00:25:34.799    team and last month when he learned that        517    00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:36.720    so many victims of the Boston Marathon        518    00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.799    bombing would become new        519    00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:41.799    amputees Michael decided to banish that        520    00:25:41.799 --> 00:25:44.480    Darkness with light Michael and his        521    00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.360    brother Harris created Mikey's run.com

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.320    together to support Michael and when        530    00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.120    this 13-year-old man was asked about his        531    00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.000    fellow amputees he said        532    00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.520    this first they will be        533    00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.720    sad they're losing something they will        534    00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.039    never get        535    00:26:24.039 --> 00:26:26.640    back and that's        536    00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.240    scary I was scared        537

   00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:16.780    [Applause]        2    00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.619    good morning my name is John Murad and        3    00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.380    this is a clip-on tie it's not the        4    00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.029    height of fashion        5    00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.990    perhaps but when you're a cop as I am        6    00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.750    there is a definite value in breakaway        7    00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.989    neck wear especially if someone's trying        8    00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.180    to choke you on Monday when I returned        9    00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.160    to the New York City Police Department        10    00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.039    after this academic sojourn I'll        11    00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.739    probably be assigned to a precinct in        12    00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.760    the Bronx or Manhattan north and I'll        13    00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.879    put this on and go forth to try to make        14    00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.239    my corner of the city a safer fairer        15    00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.650    place now I'd venture that few of us in        16    00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.900    the theater this morning are embarking        17    00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.080    on or returning to careers where clip-on        18    00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.630    ties much less prospects of getting        19    00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.330    choked are the norm        20    00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.369    after all we're Harvard graduates        21    00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.810    we're joining a distinguished fellowship        22    00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.620    of eight US presidents Nobel Prize        23    00:01:30.620 -->

community of        26    00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.700    accomplishment unlike any other and i'm        27    00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.759    proud to belong to it actually i had        28    00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.460    joined it first 18 years ago when i sat        29    00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.259    out there as a member of the college        30    00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.850    class of 1995 kirkland house and        31    00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.880    pondered my place in this distinguished        32    00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.690    fellowship back then greatness was the        33    00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.810    only option and if you had told me then        34    00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.570    that I'd end up a cop in the Bronx I'd        35    00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.660    have slowly backed away Harvard        36    00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.510    graduates don't take jobs like that they        37    00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.150    become AI bankers and startup        38    00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.980    entrepreneurs there are expectations the        39    00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.050    first of Harvard's eight US presidents        40    00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.140    writing to the second his son drove this        41    00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.769    home you come to life with advantages        42    00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.590    which will disgrace you if your success        43    00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.140    is mediocre and if you do not rise to        44    00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.930    the head not only of your profession but        45    00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.420    of your country it will be owing to your        46    00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.180    own laziness Slaven leanness and        47    00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.630    obstinacy I know right something tells        48    00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.040    me that John Adams would have been        49    00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.410    unenthused if John Quincy had come home        50    00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.959    with a clip-on tie but somewhere inside        51    00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.820    that sentiment is not alien to any of us        52    00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.880    the distinguished fellowship with its        53    00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.400    scientists and statesmen sets a high bar        54    00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.209    but let us remember this it is        55    00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.940    incomplete without those among us whose        56    00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.739    paths will not be written in history        57    00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.670    books nor on Wikipedia pages for many of        58    00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.549    you perhaps most of you the lives you've        59    00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.350    envisioned aren't necessarily the ones        60    00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.819    you'll lead        61    00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.269    and that's not a bad thing my hope today        62    00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.870    in this time before the diplomas and the        63    00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.090    family photos and the deserve addres        64    00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.390    Buhl's        65    00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.840    is to remind us all to assure us all        66    00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.109    that there is as much stature in our        67    00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.569    being social workers and teachers        68    00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:01.430    soldiers and preachers nurses and yes        69    00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.599    even cops as in being presidents and        70    00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.200    Poets Laureate a lot of you know this        71    00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.230    already but I did not when first I sat        72    00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.329    out there and now well I'm probably not        73    00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.430    the only municipal cop in the country        74    00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.739    with two harvard degrees but i'm surely        75    00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.229    in a tiny cohort and that's not a boast        76    00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.289    it's a lament if there is something        77    00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.229    special about this place and the lessons        78    00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.389    that we have learned here and i believe        79    00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.520    there is then America the world needs        80    00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.090    people like you in these roles because        81    00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.460    john adams was dead wrong success        82    00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.159    doesn't mean rising to the top it means        83    00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:50.949    changing the world and here's the secret        84    00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.680    and here's the secret everyone changes        85    00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.990    the world        86    00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.600    everything ripples it's how we do it        87    00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.770    that counts so how do we do it do you        88    00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.260    choose a job that serves others as many        89    00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.680    of you already have done do

18    00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.960    my niece is a member of the class of        19    00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.079    2013 and she's about to graduate and I        20    00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.800    was many decades ago a student here and        21    00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.160    I have four children so I know what that        22    00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.719    feels like your baby is leaving the nest        23    00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.439    they're off to their real life but today        24    00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.840    I want to lay your fears to rest they're        25    00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.880    not really leaving you and no I'm not        26    00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.320    speaking metaphorically like they're        27    00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.320    really not leaving you they're going to        28    00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.119    be home with their laundry their friends        29    00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.200    they stuff they are not leaving between        30    00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.400    now and I'm guessing age 40 they will be        31    00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.360    living back in their bedrooms probably        32    00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.960    three times at least for you students        33    00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.759    who feel like today may be the end of an        34    00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.320    era a day that you say goodbye to a        35    00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.799    community you've known the friends that        36    00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.680

    58    00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.760    there is no cell phone service where you        59    00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.440    are trust me on this now you know how        60    00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.640    class day is supposed to work as the        61    00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.360    speaker I should sit up here and spout        62    00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.440    some Brilliance and you students should        63    00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.400    nod and soak it all in but truly I tend        64    00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.120    not to give advice and I'll tell you why        65    00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.879    many years ago I was asked by a woman's        66    00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.680    magazine if I could tell them the best        67    00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.879    advice my mother had ever given given        68    00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.800    and I said I think that's a very bad        69    00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.519    idea because my mother uh is an        70    00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.959    immigrant from Cuba and she is a a tough        71    00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.680    nut mom she's not sort of warm and fuzzy        72    00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.920    mom she's kind of tough so I said let's        73    00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.920    not do that and they said no this is a        74    00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.120    great idea what is the best advice your        75    00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.840    mother ever gave you it'll be half page        76    00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.000    you two        77    00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.840    hugging I said uh okay my mother's best        78    00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.280    advice was most people are idiots the        79    00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.640    editor it was the editor on the phone        80    00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.280    said well we'll call you back click        81    00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.720    never heard from her        82    00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.840    again but it was true it was the best        83    00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.480    advice because I think that many people        84    00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.680    will tell you and spend their lives        85    00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.519    telling you what you cannot do what you        86    00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.599    should not do what you will never be        87    00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.159    able to accomplish they'll tell you why        88    00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:57.400    your ideas will not work why you will        89    00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.560    fail when you try something you haven't        90    00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.519    done and her point was they're idiots        91    00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.000    and you shouldn't listen and I think my        92    00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.560    mother would be in a position to know my        93    00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.159    parents are both immigrants to this        94    00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.480    country they met in 1958 my dad is white        95    00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.160    and Australian my mother is black and        96    00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.199    from Cuba and they met because they both        97    00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.959    went to daily mass my mom would walk but        98    00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.280    my father had a car and he would drive        99    00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.880    up next to my mom and basically hit on        100    00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.040    her he'd wind down the window of his car        101    00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.479    and say would you like a ride every        102    00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.880    single single day daily mess and every        103    00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.639    day she would say no thank you because        104    00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.400    you don't take a ride from someone you        105    00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.680    don't know well even if you're going to        106    00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.320    sit next to them in church one day she        107    00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.919    said yes I would like to take a ride and        108    00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.680    they made a date to go on a date and        109    00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.960    that night every single restaurant they        110    00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.120    went to in Baltimore Maryland in        111    00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.160    1958 turned them away cuz my mom is        112    00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.320    black and my father's white and they        113    00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.000    would say to my father you can come in        114    00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.039    but to my mother absolutely not and        115    00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.120    certainly not together so my mother        116    00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.960    eventually after being turned away from        117    00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.160    every restaurant took my father back to        118    00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.639    her apartment and made him an amazing        119    00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.199    meal of Cuban food cuz she's a        120    00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.440    tremendous cook and she would share that        121    00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.240    story with me and my sisters and her        122    00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.080    entire point was see girls if you could        123    00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.880    cook you could get a        124    00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.960    man I like to say I can't make it but I        125    00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.680    can make it        126    00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.120    happen my parents decided that they        127    00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.160    would get married married at the end of        128    00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.639    1958 when interracial marriage was        129    00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.639    illegal in their state Maryland and 16        130    00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.000    other        131    00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.080    states and they drove to Washington DC        132    00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.960    and got hitched and drove back and lived        133    00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.960    in Baltimore illegally and when their        134    00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.960    friends said whatever you do don't have        135    00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.800    kids because biracial kids will not fit        136    00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.919    in this        137    00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.400    world I'm number five of six my parents        138    00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.400    were terrible listeners every step of        139    00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.880    the way and from that I've learned do        140    00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.360    not listen to other people's take on the        141    00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.800    life you should lead my parents were        142    00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.840    excellent role models in not listening        143    00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.960    so I won't give you any advice today        144    00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.720    I'll just tell you what I've        145    00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.440    seen by not listening you can figure out        146    00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.520    what your heart is telling you to do        147    00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.000    when I was at Harvard I was studying        148    00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.319    English and American literature and I        149    00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:23.599    was Premed but then I realized that        150    00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.720    telling stories was my passion and I        151    00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.800    switched and started working at a local        152    00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.599    TV station it kind of worked out now I        153    00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.479    travel the globe telling        154    00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:37.000    stories not taking advice means you'll        155    00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.280    break those boundaries those walls that        156    00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.639    exist that make us feel like we're        157    00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:44.680    different from other people we meet not        158    00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.880    taking advice means you'll stop looking        159    00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.280    for meaning in things that have no        160    00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.520    meaning listen some relationships are        161    00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.000    not meant to be delete those numbers        162    00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.599    from your phone and move        163    00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:00.639    on bad things sometimes happen and        164    00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:02.800    they'll continue to happen until good        165    00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.720    people get in the way and I've seen this        166    00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.440    time and time again in every single        167    00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.919    story I've covered be that good person        168    00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:14.919    decide what you want to be and I'm not        169    00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:18.319    talking about a job I'm talking about        170    00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:21.479    the kind of person you want to be it is        171    00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:24.319    up to you and no one else people can be        172    00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:28.160    mean and unfair but more far far more        173    00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.479    people are good and they're generous and        174    00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:32.479    they're helpful and they're hopeful and        175    00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:33.520    that means that you're going to have to        176    00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.400    lead with an open heart and it also        177    00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.319    means that that little heart probably is        178    00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:40.120    going to get stomped on a few more times        179    00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.720    than you'd like but if you go where your        180    00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.520    passion and your heart leads you I        181    00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.639    guarantee you you will have incredible        182    00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:53.479    experiences I have leaning in as Cheryl        183    00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:55.400    Sandberg likes to say it's not just a        184    00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.919    strategy for women in business early in        185    00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:00.800    their careers it's advice for everybody        186    00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.199    but I would add lean in to use your        187    00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:05.680    voice and lean in to make change where        188    00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.759    it needs to be made and lean in to        189    00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:10.919    invest your heart and your soul in ideas        190    00:08:10.919 --> 00:08:13.919    and people maybe others don't care for        191    00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:17.360    or even don't see the value in because        192    00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.199    leaning back when you're young is just        193    00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:22.599    another word for        194    00:08:22.599 --> 00:08:25.199    cynicism and that's not clever when        195    00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:27.879    you've been given all the advantages        196    00:08:27.879 --> 00:08:30.039    that you have been given in educ ation        197    00:08:30.039 --> 00:08:32.760    if you are sitting here        198    00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.000    today in        199    00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.599    1958 my mother and father were living as        200    00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:39.719    a married couple in Baltimore        201    00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:41.760    Maryland and my mother would tell me the        202    00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.480    story of how people would spit on them        203    00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.440    as they walked down the street together        204    00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.800    I would say to her how did you deal with        205    00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.959    that I mean what did you do and she said        206    00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:57.360    oh lovey calls me lovey oh lovey we knew        207    00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.640    America was better than that        208    00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.160    and we knew we had to be part of making        209    00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.560    it better that's what it was about and        210    00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.839    she knew that if you were knocked off        211    00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:13.560    your path anytime someone spit on you        212    00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.839    literally or        213    00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:18.279    metaphorically you might not get to        214    00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:20.079    where you were trying to        215    00:09:20.079 --> 00:09:22.600    go because she had a dream which was the        216    00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.040    American dream and a dream that she        217    00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.560    would realize as all coming out of        218    00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.040    poverty in Cuba and all of her sick kids        219    00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.600    graduating from Harvard and one of her        220    00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.600    grandchildren sitting in this audience        221    00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.519    today so please as my mother would        222    00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:40.079    advise you if she were here don't listen        223    00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.519    to idiots figure out your dream and be        224    00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:45.560    brave enough to go and live it otherwise        225    00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.839    as a friend told me the other day        226    00:09:47.839 --> 00:09:49.480    someone will hire you to help them with        227    00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.279    their dream and if that doesn't sound        228    00:09:52.279 --> 00:09:55.760    quite as fulfilling does it today you        229    00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.000    begin new amazing things and maybe some        230    00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.240    mundane crap too for some of you        231    00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.519    probably should learn how to work a fax        232    00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:06.600    machine H I spent my first year out of        233    00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.680    college answering phones and removing        234    00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.800    Staples from walls but my dream which        235    00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.640    was to tell stories of people whose        236    00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.720    stories often weren't told like my mom        237    00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.959    like many people in this audience people        238    00:10:19.959 --> 00:10:22.880    who are on the cusp of amazing things if        239    00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.600    they decide to be brave and committed to        240    00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.720    what life could be unfettered from the        241    00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.440    expectations of others and truly truly        242    00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.959    unafraid what I have seen in my career        243    00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:38.399    whether covering tsunamis in Asia or        244    00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:40.279    Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans or        245    00:10:40.279 --> 00:10:42.120    earthquakes in Haiti is that pretty much        246    00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.639    everybody wants the same thing we're        247    00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:47.279    much more alike than we're        248    00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:49.600    different you need to break through        249    00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.000    walls that you think exist between        250    00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000    people who don't look like you and don't        251    00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.800    act like you because those walls don't        252    00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.839    have to exist you need to seek to        253    00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:00.360    understand why why people act like they        254    00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.040    do why people do what they do seek to        255    00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.360    know people where they are you don't        256    00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.160    always have to agree but having        257    00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.959    conversations is the only way to bridge        258    00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:15.440    the distance in understanding each other        259    00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.399    not taking advice means you can choose        260    00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:18.880    to stand up for people who need your        261    00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.839    voice you'll have chances unfortunately        262    00:11:21.839 --> 00:11:25.680    every day to say this is not okay or you        263    00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.880    can choose to walk by and avert your        264    00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.600    eyes when you see an injust big or        265    00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.120    small be that person who stops and at        266    00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.000    the risk of not voicing a popular        267    00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.040    opinion say this is not okay this is not        268    00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.000    okay cuz America is better than        269    00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.440    that you have probably the greatest        270    00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.880    education money can buy if you're        271

--> 00:01:40.840    traveled long distances to come to        29    00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.119    Harvard Yard this week for a graduation        30    00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.159    but I have to break some news to        31    00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.560    you this isn't graduation graduation        32    00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.280    already happened in fact it happened        33    00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.680    many times        34    00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.200    over it happened when the actors Among        35    00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.399    Us took their final bows after so many        36    00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.079    shows in the low        37    00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.119    backs it happened when a dedicated        38    00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.119    scientist put down his last pip pet and        39    00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.280    left the lab for good it happened when a        40    00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.959    football player completed his last        41    00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.360    forward pass it happened on a whole lot        42    00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.840    of thesis        43    00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.560    deadlines there's a sting to a        44    00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.160    graduation it comes when you snap that        45    00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.000    rubber band that's tied your feet and        46    00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.519    your brain and eventually your heart to        47    00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.920    a place for so many years that        48    00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.120    hurts that kind of        49    00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.720    graduation will happen many times        50    00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.239    tomorrow night when we give one last hug        51    00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.480    to a roommate realizing that someone        52    00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.040    who's gone from perfect stranger to True        53    00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.680    family in 4 years will forever more be        54    00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.879    sleeping across the country or across        55    00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.519    the world instead of just cross your n        56    00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.239    plus1        57    00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.319    Suite that's what graduation feels        58    00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.760    like for me one graduation happened back        59    00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.640    in December as I stood in the basement        60    00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.440    of the Harvard Crimson staring at the        61    00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.080    presses that print our newspaper every        62    00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.560    day I'd stood there many a time before        63    00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.959    whenever a night of editing passed and        64    00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.120    the dawn found me still sitting at my        65    00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.560    desk I'd always hear a tiny bell and a        66    00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.159    rumble below me that Drew me downstairs        67    00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.840    to watch the presses start spitting out        68    00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.840    paper after paper I'd Revel in the fact        69    00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.840    that I had made something that day        70    00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.439    something tangible something that maybe        71    00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:53.280    had the power to change this place        72    00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.840    sometimes then that night of graduation        73    00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.159    in December my fellow Crimson staff and        74    00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.840    I gathered to watch the ceremonial        75    00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.840    printing of the last issue of our year        76    00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.720    as editors once again I heard that tiny        77    00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.360    bell and that        78    00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.560    Rumble and as the paper started racing        79    00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.799    through the Ink        80    00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.280    Rollers I started to        81    00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.360    cry I won't cry today or        82    00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.639    tomorrow because that sting of        83    00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.600    graduation doesn't really happen at a        84    00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.199    ceremony        85    00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.280    it's been happening all over this campus        86    00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.280    in public and in private for every one        87    00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.240    of        88    00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.440    us there have been so many        89    00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.160    graduations but there's only one        90    00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.720    commencement before this week our class        91    00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.280    was all together on just one other day        92    00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.240    in our four years at Harvard as we've        93    00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.639    been reminded today our class was the        94    00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.479    first in Harvard's history to ever have        95    00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.360    a freshman convocation        96    00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.880    ceremony we were new then to this        97    00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.960    intimidating Neo Georgian place we sat        98    00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.400    in these same folding chairs in tent        99    00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.520    tenery        100    00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.120    theater we heard an incredible        101    00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.120    message these might not have been        102    00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.280    exactly the words we heard but the point        103    00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:30.360    was this place is yours now Ready Set Go        104    00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.360    and we went we occupied the classrooms        105    00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.080    and we occupied the playing fields and        106    00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.840    for a while we even occupied the        107    00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.120    yard Harvard offered us a multitude of        108    00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.039    stages and we all found our places to        109    00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:50.560    dance        110    00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.759    here we stumbled through the steps at        111    00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.400    first Sometimes painfully but we found        112    00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.039    our way to the Limelight at last        113    00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.880    now all those curtains have closed on us        114    00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.560    each Curtain Call meant another        115    00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.199    graduation and wherever our paths have        116    00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:14.800    veed each one led us back to these same        117    00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.960    folding chairs in tent Henry theater        118    00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.120    where again We Gather to Mark not a        119    00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.319    graduation but a beginning a        120    00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.479    commencement I don't know where all of        121    00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.319    you are going on the journey that begins        122    00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:34.319    now but I hope the paths you take on        123    00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:37.960    your way there are just as fulfilling        124    00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.280    and just as all consuming and just as        125    00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.479    varied as the paths you took as you        126    00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:46.720    bounded through the halls of        127    00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.720    Harvard because the world needs people        128    00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.479    who put the same energy into preventing        129    00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:56.240    climate change or writing        130    00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.960    legislation that I've seen you put into        131    00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.400    writing papers or planning hoko        132    00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.199    events the world needs people who've        133    00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:06.840    stayed up all night on a homeless        134    00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.319    shelter shift or woken up Before Sunrise        135    00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:13.599    to get to practice when it comes time        136    00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:16.440    for overnight rounds at a hospital or        137    00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.400    the morning news on local        138    00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.639    TV if you've set foot in the office of        139    00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:25.639    career services this year you might have        140    00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:28.120    come to the conclusion that what the        141    00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.440    world needs is a whole lot of        142    00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.199    consultants and investment bankers and        143    00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:35.759    that's sort of true but that's not the        144    00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:38.400    whole truth and the whole truth isn't        145    00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.720    just that we need teachers and        146    00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.039    researchers and veterinarians too and        147    00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:47.879    Bakers and chist and        148    00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:50.840    auctioneers it's not that        149    00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.879    easy real life isn't going to be just        150    00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:58.919    about what you do it's about the steps        151    00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:00.319    you take        152    00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:03.240    about the moments when you know you're        153    00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.599    not just listening to someone else's        154    00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:10.440    tune you're dancing to your own        155    00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.960    music Here's what the world        156    00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.840    needs people who know how to arrive at a        157    00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:23.039    place that's huge and complicated and        158    00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:25.360    scary a place like        159    00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.800    Harvard and then make it their        160    00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.440    own and that means every single one of        161    00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.200    us we found our stages        162    00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.640    here and we've graduated from        163    00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:45.360    them now in the huge complicated scary        164    00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.120    nation and World there are big stages        165    00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.800    out there waiting and I know just the        166    00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.800    people to dance on all of        167    00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.240    them put on on your dancing shoes        168    00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.240    Harvard class of        169    00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.519    2013 this is a beginning and I know what        170    00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:08.519    happened the last time we all commenced        171    00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:09.760    something        172    00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.959    together we took on the challenge we        173    00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:16.240    learned the steps even if we often        174    00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.079    faltered and        175    00:09:18.079 --> 00:09:21.040    eventually we achieved some pretty        176    00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.320    incredible        177    00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.920    graduations as new curtains open now I        178    00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.160    know we've got what it takes to find our        179    00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.000    way to the most meaningful of        180    00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.920    spotlights do you hear your music        181    00:09:36.920 -->

   Alumni on the year that is ending and        11    00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.110    this was a year that for a number of        12    00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.250    reasons demands special note the world        13    00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.680    is too much with us the lines of        14    00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.830    Wordsworth's well-known poem echoed in        15    00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.050    my mind as I thought about my remarks        16    00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.650    today for the world has intruded on us        17    00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.410    this year in ways we never would have        18    00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.829    imagined the university had not        19    00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.710    officially closed for a day since 1978        20    00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.939    this year it closed three times twice it        21    00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.420    was for cases of extreme weather first        22    00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.380    for superstorm sandy and then for Nemo        23    00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.479    the record-breaking February blizzard        24    00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.899    the third was of course the day of        25    00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.079    Boston's locked down in the aftermath of        26    00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.679    the tragic Marathon bombings this was a        27    00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:32.990    year that challenged fundamental        28    00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.840    assumptions about life security        29    00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.030    stability and predictability yet as I        30    00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.030    reflected on these intrusions from a        31    00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.240    world so very much with us I was struck        32    00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.450    by how we at Harvard are so actively        33    00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.679    engaged in shaping that world and indeed        34    00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.529    in addressing so many of the most        35    00:01:57.529 --> 00:02:00.529    important and trying questions that        36    00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:04.609    these recent events have posed just two        37    00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.999    weeks ago climate scientists and        38    00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.979    disaster relief workers gathered here        39    00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.980    for a two-day conference co-sponsored by        40    00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.770    the Harvard humanitarian initiative        41    00:02:15.770 -->

presented by Sandy and Nemo        44    00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.890    and to consider how academic researchers        45    00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.740    and workers on the ground can        46    00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.310    collaborate more effectively this        47    00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.340    gathering represents just one example of        48    00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.730    the wide range of activities across the        49    00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.820    university dedicated to addressing the        50    00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.940    challenges of climate change how can we        51    00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.740    advance the science that helps us        52    00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.350    understand climate change perhaps even        53    00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.010    avert it how can we devise solutions        54    00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.290    from new technologies to principles of        55    00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.340    urban design that might mitigate it how        56    00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.190    can we envision the public policies to        57    00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.180    manage and respond to it Harvard is        58    00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.000    deeply engaged with the broad issues of        59    00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.940    energy and environment offering more        60    00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.540    than 250 courses in this area        61    00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.930    gathering 225 faculty through our        62    00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.650    environment Center and its programs        63    00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.360    enrolling a hundred doctoral students        64    00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.580    from seven schools and many different        65    00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.640    disciplines in a graduate consortium        66    00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.130    designed to broaden their understanding        67    00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.520    of environmental issues our faculty are        68    00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.070    studying atmospheric composition and        69    00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.320    working to develop renewable energy        70    00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.720    sources they are seeking to manage        71    00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.540    rising oceans and to reimagine cities        72    00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.000    for an era of increasingly threatening        73    00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.459    weather they are helping to fashion        74    00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.350    environmental regulations and        75    00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.860    international climate agreements so the        76    00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.900    weather isn't something that simply        77    00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.780    happens at Harvard even though it may        78    00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.490    have seemed that way when we had to        79    00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.790    close this year it is a focus of study        80    00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.840    and of research as we work to confront        81    00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.300    the implications of climate change and        82    00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.720    help shape national and international        83    00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.930    responses to its extremes when Boston        84    00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.490    experienced the tragedy of the marathon        85    00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.350    bombings last month the city and sir        86    00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.120    municipalities went into lockdown on        87    00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.330    April 19th to help ensure the capture of        88    00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.660    the escaped suspect and Harvard        89    00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.410    responded in extraordinary ways within        90    00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.350    our own community students faculty and        91    00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.460    staff went well beyond their ordinary        92    00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.960    responsibilities to support one another        93    00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.990    and keep the university operating        94    00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.250    smoothly and safely under unprecedented        95    00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.160    circumstances but we also witnessed our        96    00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.280    colleagues magnificent efforts to meet        97    00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.590    the needs of Boston and our other        98    00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.070    neighbors in the crisis the Harvard        99    00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.220    police worked with other law enforcement        100    00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.740    agencies and several of our officers        101    00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.530    played a critical role in saving the        102    00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.350    life of the transit officer wounded in        103    00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.130    Watertown        104    00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.700    doctors nurses and other staff many from        105    00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.950    our affiliated hospitals performed a        106    00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.500    near miracle in ensuring that every        107    00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.200    injured person who arrived at a hospital        108    00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.340    survived years of disaster planning and        109    00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.210    emergency readiness enabled these        110    00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.180    institutions to act in a stunningly        111    00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.860    coordinated and effective manner        112    00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.100    I am deeply proud of the contributions        113    00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.470    made by members of the Harvard community        114    00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.200    in the immediate aftermath of the        115    00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.840    bombings but our broader and ongoing        116    00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.540    responsibility as a university is to ask        117    00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.560    and address the larger questions any        118    00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.100    such tragedy poses to prepare for the        119    00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.300    next crisis and the one after that even        120    00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.510    as we work to prevent them to help us        121    00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.360    all understand the origins and the        122    00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.810    meaning of such terrible events in human        123    00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.860    lives and societies we do this work in        124    00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.410    the teaching and research to which we        125    00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.640    devote ourselves every day investigators        126    00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.950    at the Harvard hospitals are exploring        127    00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.760    improved techniques for managing injury        128    00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.410    researchers at Brigham and Women's for        129    00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.990    example are pursuing the prospect of leg        130    00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.350    transplants for amputees a faculty        131    00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.360    member in the School of Engineering and        132    00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.910    Applied Sciences is studying traumatic        133    00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.120    brain injury faculty in the business and        134    00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.730    Kennedy schools are teaching and        135    00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.850    learning about leadership in times of        136    00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.000    crisis analyzing historic and        137    00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.150    contemporary examples from Shackleton        138    00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.160    and Antarctica to Katrina in New Orleans        139    00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.670    searching for lessons for the future the        140    00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.940    very day of the lockdown the Mahendra        141    00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.700    Humanities Center and the Harvard Law        142    00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.580    School program in negotiation had        143    00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.160    scheduled a conference on confronting        144    00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.159    evil examining the cognitive        145    00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:48.669    and social implications of both what it        146    00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:52.209    called everyday evils and extraordinary        147    00:07:52.209 --> 00:07:55.899    crimes a few days later the Harvard        148    00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:58.119    Divinity School assembled a panel of        149    00:07:58.119 --> 00:08:02.369    experts to discuss religion and terror        150    00:08:02.369 --> 00:08:05.619    exploring sources of violence in Bosnia        151    00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:08.649    in the Middle East and in the troubles        152    00:08:08.649 --> 00:08:10.869    in Ireland which had served as a        153    00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:13.659    formative experience for our Divinity        154    00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:16.899    School Dean in his youth at the        155    00:08:16.899 --> 00:08:19.119    Institute of Politics at the Kennedy        156    00:08:19.119 --> 00:08:21.399    School law enforcement emergency        157    00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:23.979    management and other experts gathered to        158    00:08:23.979 --> 00:08:25.779    consider lessons learned from the        159    00:08:25.779 --> 00:08:29.439    bombings as we struggled to understand        160    00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:32.019    the events that shook our city and our        161    00:08:32.019 --> 00:08:35.500    region members of our community were        162    00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.319    already engaged in interpreting the        163    00:08:38.319 --> 00:08:41.620    world that had produced such tragedy and        164    00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.889    in seeking ways to prevent its        165    00:08:44.889 --> 00:08:50.170    recurrence three unusual days making for        166    00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:54.939    an unusual year yet these three unusual        167    00:08:54.939 --> 00:08:59.529    days underscore and illuminate the usual        168    00:08:59.529 --> 00:09:03.819    work of this University calling on        169    00:09:03.819 --> 00:09:06.360    knowledge and research to address        170    00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.699    fundamental challenges and dilemmas with        171    00:09:09.699 --> 00:09:13.019    resources drawn from the widest scope of        172    00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:16.689    human inquiry from the insights of the        173    00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:19.449    natural and Social Sciences to the        174    00:09:19.449 --> 00:09:22.480    reflections on meaning and values at the        175    00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.170    heart of the humanities universities        176    00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:29.399    urge us towards a better future and        177    00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:33.670    equip us as individuals and societies to        178    00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.660    get there yet other events this past        179    00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.589    year remind us we cannot take what        180    00:09:40.589 --> 00:09:44.709    universities do for granted this year        181    00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:46.930    has brought home not just the threats of        182    00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:48.970    extreme weather and of terror and        183    00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:52.269    violence it has also been a year that        184    00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:55.139    has challenged fundamental assumptions        185    00:09:55.139 --> 00:09:57.500    undergirding American higher        186    00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.290    Haitian and the foundations of our        187    00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:04.100    nation's research Enterprise I've just        188    00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.140    offered some examples of how our        189    00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.840    research and teaching can contribute to        190    00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.420    addressing urgent problems facing our        191    00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.840    world we live in an era in which        192    00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.240    knowledge is more vital than ever to        193    00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.170    nations economies and societies        194    00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.700    knowledge is I often say the most        195    00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.460    important currency of the 21st century        196    00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.730    and universities are places that more        197    00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.370    than any other generate and disseminate        198    00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:34.790    that knowledge in the United States        199    00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.640    the partnership between universities and        200    00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.680    the federal government established after        201    00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.040    World War two has been a powerful engine        202    00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.980    of scientific discovery and of        203    00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:50.420    prosperity yet that partnership now more        204    00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.540    than a half century old is threatened by        205    00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.880    the erosion of federal support for        206    00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.510    research a situation made acute by the        207    00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:03.410    sequester an estimated ten billion        208    00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.600    dollars will be cut from the federal        209    00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.650    government's research budget in 2013 the        210    00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:11.660    National Institute of Health calculates        211    00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.330    that cuts to its resources could mean        212    00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:18.170    the loss of more than 20,000 jobs in the        213    00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.070    life sciences sector here at Harvard we        214    00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.310    receive approximately 16% of our        215    00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.860    operating budget from federal research        216    00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.830    funding we anticipate we may see        217    00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.110    declines of as much as 40 million        218    00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:36.020    dollars annually in federal support for        219    00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:40.339    research what does all this mean faculty        220    00:11:40.339 --> 00:11:42.650    are finding that even grant applications        221    00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.170    with perfect scores and peer evaluations        222    00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.589    are not getting funded they see existing        223    00:11:48.589 --> 00:11:51.890    Awards being reduced aspiring younger        224    00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:54.050    scientists are fearful they will not        225    00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.690    receive career launching grants on which        226    00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:59.960    their futures depend some are        227    00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.270    entertaining overtures from countries        228    00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.870    outside the United States        229    00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.540    it's where science investment is robust        230    00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:10.320    and expanding students contemplating        231    00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.540    graduate training are wondering if they        232    00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.740    should pursue other options great ideas        233    00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.710    that could lead to improved human lives        234    00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:23.029    and opportunities and improved        235    00:12:23.029 --> 00:12:26.550    understanding are left without support        236    00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:30.930    or the means for further development the        237    00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.870    world and the nation need the kind of        238    00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.570    research that Harvard and other American        239    00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.750    universities undertake we need the        240    00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.460    knowledge and understanding that        241    00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.100    research generates knowledge about        242    00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.410    climate change or crisis management or        243    00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.540    melanoma or effective mental health        244    00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.850    interventions in schools or hormones        245

00:12:59.430    faculty are currently pursuing we need        248    00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.800    the support and encouragement for the        249    00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.170    students who will create our scientific        250    00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.170    future we need the economic vitality        251    00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:10.020    that jobs and companies that these ideas        252    00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.380    and discoveries produce we need the        253    00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.600    nation to resist imposing a        254    00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.750    self-inflicted wound on its intellectual        255    00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.990    and human capital we need a nation that        256    00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.660    believes in and invests in universities        257    00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:27.300    because we represent an investment in        258    00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.029    the ideas and the people that will build        259    00:13:30.029 --> 00:13:36.440    and will be the future so as I        260    00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.640    so as I report to you on the year we now        261    00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.310    bring to a close I want to underscore        262    00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.310    the threat to universities and to our        263    00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.649    national infrastructure of knowledge and        264    00:13:55.649 --> 00:13:58.519    discovery that the sequester represents        265    00:13:58.519 --> 00:14:01.410    even in a year when sometimes the world        266    00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.529    felt too much with us we have never lost        267    00:14:04.529 --> 00:14:08.100    sight of how much what we do here has to        268    00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.990    do with the world and for the world to        269    00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.180    sequester the search for knowledge to        270    00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.910    sequester discovery to sequester the        271    00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:20.250    unrelenting drive of our students and        272    00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.370    faculty to envision and pursue this        273    00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:26.850    endless frontier such a strategy does        274    00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:30.149    more than threaten universities it puts        275    00:14:30.149 --> 00:14:33.529    at risk the capacity and promise of        276    00:14:33.529 --> 00:14:36.570    universities to fulfill our commitment        277    00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.570    to the public good our commitment to the        278    00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.750    children and grandchildren and to the        279    00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:46.410    future we will leave them the challenges        280    00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.410    facing the world are too consequential        281    00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:53.149    the need for knowledge imagination and        282    00:14:53.149 --> 00:14:56.520    understanding are too great the        283    00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.220    opportunity for improving the human        284    00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.670    condition too precious for us to do        285    00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:06.020    anything less than rise to the occasion        286    00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:09.089    with the devotion of our alumni with the        287    00:15:09.089 --> 00:15:12.149    inspiration of our new graduates and I        288    00:15:12.149 --> 00:15:14.310    hope with the support of our nation's        289    00:15:14.310 -->

the        41    00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.150    opportunity to be a first-class idiot in        42    00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.769    front of the most important people in my        43    00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.310    life I refer of course to the kids from        44    00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.610    my Acton section the lifelong friends I        45    00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.970    made at the first chance dance and the        46    00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.370    ones I unsuccessfully reunited with at        47    00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.599    the last chance dance that being said        48    00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.060    this speech will probably be fine I mean        49    00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.590    so many people have performed on this        50    00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.540    stage there's no way that I'll be the        51    00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.310    all-time worst        52    00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.739    unless I start dropping the lyrics to        53    00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.389    Rack City but I can't help but be        54    00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.060    terrified it's like my red phone just        55    00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.889    rang all day I felt like a freshman        56    00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.829    running primal scream I've been out of        57    00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.560    breath pretty sweaty and a little bit        58    00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.030    aroused but I shouldn't be the only one        59    00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.519    sweating think about this school from        60    00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.470    which we are graduating think about the        61    00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.660    people who have walked these hallowed        62    00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.370    halls Theodore Teddy Roosevelt Ted the        63    00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.269    Unabomber Kaczynski Atom admissions        64    00:03:38.269 -->

presidents many        67    00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.419    business tycoons and countless SAT        68    00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.959    tutors        69    00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:58.269    last year Harvard celebrated its 370        70    00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.010    fifth birthday        71    00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.390    that's 375 years of education research        72    00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.840    and Michael Sandel teaching justice 375        73    00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.139    years that's almost $3,000 sounds        74    00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.750    impressive right        75    00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.400    yeah maybe a bit too impressive in fact        76    00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.680    I'd go so far as to say that Harvard        77    00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.009    sounds downright dangerous Harvard has        78    00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.289    lasted through countless Wars more than        79    00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.720    a few economic depressions and Four Loko        80    00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.370    I mean if Harvard has lasted this many        81    00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.139    years who's to say that it's not going        82    00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:47.770    to last another 375,000 I can't even        83    00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.840    count that high in dog years        84    00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.800    in light of this I'd like to talk to you        85    00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.840    all about something serious senior gift        86    00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.729    the best senior gift we could possibly        87    00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.940    give to this University we need to tear        88    00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.090    down this school yes that's right class        89    00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.880    of 2013 we must burn this university to        90    00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.940    the ground I need you to stop        91    00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.250    snapchatting pictures of administrators        92    00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.570    with crazy drawn on handlebar mustaches        93    00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.580    stand up and

University Hall        106    00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:06.140    using the flawless alias a blue        107    00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.620    and I made it past the administration's        108    00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.000    best defenses I had to come back come        109    00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.230    soon two pounds of hud squash listen to        110    00:06:18.230 -->

Hammonds all in order to steal our        113    00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.640    diplomas they can't stop us now and if        114    00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.320    we strike immediately we'll get away        115    00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.890    with it        116    00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.870    there'll be no evidence against us I        117    00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.760    mean it's not like this is being        118    00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:43.670    recorded oh it is well it's not it's not        119    00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:49.010    like everyone's gonna see it this this        120    00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.820    video has already gone viral in Korea        121    00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.020    they did a remix of it with Gangnam        122    00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.680    style        123    00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.740    oh ho hold on you mean to tell me that a        124    00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.450    university with the technological        125    00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.060    expertise of a blind Amish man from the        126    00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.980    19th century is filming and        127    00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.470    live-streaming this come on we're        128    00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.060    talking about a school whose email        129    00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.860    interface had for years        130    00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.320    looked like a third grader in 1999 gave        131    00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.700    up halfway through making a live journal        132    00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.880    okay so even if there are consequences        133    00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.980    Harvard needs to be destroyed and we're        134    00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.410    clearly the only ones who can do it        135    00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.740    Harvard hasn't just survived 375 years        136    00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.600    of providing half-decent higher        137    00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.150    education it even survived the mine        138    00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.620    apocalypse of 2012        139    00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.740    hell even God tried to take down Harvard        140    00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.970    ants three hundred and seventy fifth        141    00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.750    birthday unleashing an unholy flood that        142    00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.760    only managed to wash away all the grass        143    00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.850    in tercentenary theatre a 2,000 serving        144    00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.190    cake and the dignity of everyone in        145    00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.100    attendance it could have at least taken        146    00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.440    the extension school with it thankfully        147    00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.680    yo-yo ma remained safe        148    00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:07.330    praise yo-yo if Harvard can survive all        149    00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.300    of that it can survive anything        150    00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.850    hundreds of years after we've all died        151    00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.039    during one of the many future killing        152    00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:20.080    sprees of Nina the Ripper Yancey Harvard        153    00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.449    will still stand strong Harvard will        154    00:08:22.449 --> 00:08:26.289    outlive the human race so 2013 it's up        155    00:08:26.289 --> 00:08:29.050    to us we must destroy Harvard because        156    00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.780    when we wake up on May 31st and move on        157    00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.880    with the rest of our lives we will face        158    00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.560    the temptation of allowing all        159    00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.659    relationship with this place to feel        160    00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:39.880    like an awkward freshman week one-night        161    00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.529    stand        162    00:08:40.529 --> 00:08:44.020    after all Harvard doesn't really need us        163    00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.899    and while we walk of shame to the rest        164    00:08:46.899 --> 00:08:49.630    of our lives Harvard will keep going as        165    00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.270    if nothing at all has changed except for        166    00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.279    occasional booty calls in the form of        167    00:08:54.279 --> 00:08:57.730    donation requests and drunken hookups in        168    00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:01.450    the form of reunions after we leave will        169    00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:04.450    officially have been replaced by younger        170    00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.550    more awkward and less attractive        171    00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:10.390    versions of ourselves on Friday Harvard        172    00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.750    College will stop being our story and        173    00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.910    start being the story of a generation        174    00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:21.040    coming-of-age on tinder oh we must        175    00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.050    destroy Harvard because when we wake up        176    00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.779    on May 31st we won't be able to complain        177    00:09:25.779 --> 00:09:29.200    about midterms problem-sets and still        178    00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.950    being a virgin well some of us will        179    00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.800    still have that last one after we        180    00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.720    graduate though we may spend weeks        181    00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.510    arriving seven minutes late to work        182    00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.250    trying to pay our rent with bored Plus        183    00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.279    and having stress dreams that take place        184    00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:48.250    at Mather lather Harvard won't wonder        185    00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.380    why we're missing the Harvard won't ask        186    00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.170    why we're not in our rooms or in class        187    00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.690    or spending hours stalking each other on        188    00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.390    Facebook we must destroy Harvard because        189    00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.480    whether you've mostly loved or mostly        190    00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.839    hated this place it will inevitably draw        191    00:10:04.839 --> 00:10:08.800    you back in an alumnus but an outsider        192    00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.400    you may return to campus many times or        193    00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.680    never        194    00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.779    regardless you will probably be drawn        195    00:10:16.779 --> 00:10:20.290    back in simpler ways seeing a flash of        196    00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.120    crimson in a bustling crowd and        197    00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.709    remembering that it's weird that our        198    00:10:23.709 --> 00:10:27.670    mascot was just a color walking near a        199    00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.130    farm and smelling the fresh aroma of the        200    00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.079    same manure that graces the yard every        201    00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:35.380    spring taking a shot at a party and        202    00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.870    recognizing the sweet sweet taste of        203    00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.769    Rubinoff some part of Harvard will        204    00:10:41.769 --> 00:10:45.310    always be with all of us and though many        205    00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.410    memories may fade when Harvard does come        206    00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.980    to mind years from now in all of its 375        207    00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.519    plus year old glory we will be        208    00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:56.319    acknowledging that younger versions of        209    00:10:56.319 --> 00:10:59.399    ourselves now own this simultaneously        210

at a        58    00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.920    memorial church and I had to go to one        59    00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.829    of his afternoon teas these things were        60    00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.290    on my Harvard bucket list right up there        61    00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.420    with running primal scream peeing on a        62    00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.730    John Harvard statue and that other thing        63    00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.650    freshman fall I bumped into Reverend        64    00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.260    gomes just over there by canada and i        65    00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.970    told him that i would make sure to come        66    00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.770    to one of his teas and to one of his        67    00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.460    sermons that fall i experienced a shock        68    00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.530    that we all experience at harvard        69    00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.600    the shock of transitioning from being        70    00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.780    the kid who graduated top of the class        71    00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.460    who was president of every silly resume        72    00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.430    padding high school organization who was        73    00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.280    a hometown hero to being one of 64        74    00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.000    hundred people who all did that i        75    00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.320    reacted to that shot the way most of us        76    00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.440    did i comp the crimson it was pretty        77    00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.190    boring like many i signed up for every        78    00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.710    extra curricular and stretched myself        79    00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.580    thin still hearing reverend gums speak        80    00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.380    and going to one of his teas remained in        81    00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.840    the back of my mind there were things i        82    00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.050    was going to do eventually after I        83    00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.060    finished that problem set that crimson        84    00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.490    news article that Lampoon cop piece the        85    00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.350    reading for section back when I read for        86    00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.280    section eventually that December 2010        87    00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.380    reverend gomes suffered a stroke when I        88    00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.080    heard the news I felt concern for        89    00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.610    Reverend Gomes and his loved ones and I        90    00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.580    also felt a sense of urgency I had to go        91    00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.130    to Memorial Church to hear him speak I        92    00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.880    had to go to one of his afternoon teas I        93    00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.250    promised myself I would do both        94    00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.310    eventually for months problem sets        95    00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.760    readings and meetings got in the way but        96    00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.620    still I promised myself that I would go        97    00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.210    on March 1st 2011 I woke to an email        98    00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.270    from president Faust the subject line        99    00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.970    was Peter Gomes announcement it read        100    00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.460    dear members of the Harvard community is        101    00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.040    with immense sadness with I write today        102    00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.140    to share them the use of the passing of        103    00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.010    the Reverend professor of Peter J Gomes        104    00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.390    Reverend Gomes died last night from        105    00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.470    complications arising from a stroke at        106    00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.730    Harvard there's a pervading culture of        107    00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.820    eventually the senior survey is just one        108    00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.370    example of this culture according to the        109    00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.620    survey many of us wish to be working in        110    00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.650    fields very        111    00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.419    different than the ones we're about to        112    00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.060    answer family needs and relationships        113    00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.560    can cause one to answer a field that        114    00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.080    one's not truly passionate about but the        115    00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.759    discrepancy between where we are working        116    00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:37.280    where we wish we were working seems too        117    00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.810    large to be explained by those factors        118    00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.990    alone I think our fascination with        119    00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.729    eventually is the cause of this        120    00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.130    discrepancy you want to do this 2-year        121    00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.930    program and then that fellowship is not        122    00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.190    other to your program and then        123    00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.710    eventually we'll do what it is we want        124    00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.120    to do but eventually isn't promised        125    00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.100    options become distractions two years        126    00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.650    become 20 years and eventually becomes        127    00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.949    never home reminds me of how easily        128    00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:06.889    eventually can become never and sixth        129    00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:08.680    grade my house was shot in a drive-by        130    00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.570    four months afterward every time a car        131    00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.789    drove by at night my mom would go to the        132    00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:16.400    window and watch an affair sophomore        133    00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.770    year my cousin was shot and killed she        134    00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.860    was 22 when I was 16 I got shot        135    00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.410    accidentally by a friend after I left        136    00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.120    the hospital that night after watching        137    00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.460    my mom cry my friends won't cry my other        138    00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.690    friends wanna cry you know mom's I        139    00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.160    looked down another two bullet holes in        140    00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:41.930    my shirt these holes remind me that        141    00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.820    eventually isn't promised in March I was        142    00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.099    working on a take home mid son like I        143    00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:50.930    always do when trying to be productive I        144    00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.770    ended up on YouTube watching drag videos        145    00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.930    with my block mates sorry from the        146    00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.039    bottom now

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.169    wrote the lyrics Cohen said I think I        150    00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:07.610    was sitting in a bar in a Polynesian        151    00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.220    restaurant in Miami Beach I don't know        152    00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.979    what I was doing there I have no program        153    00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:16.190    I have no 5-year plan I think we could        154    00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.229    all benefit from living a bit more like        155    00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:20.750    Leonard Cohen I'd love to tell my        156    00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.270    freshman year self to go to a tee and        157    00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.740    say here the late Reverend go and speak        158    00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.580    but I can what I can do is tell our        159    00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.949    present cells that we should do now not        160    00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:34.740    eventually what we want to do        161    00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.139    so many of us have that book we will        162    00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:39.539    eventually write that nonprofit we will        163    00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:42.150    eventually start that community we will        164    00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.389    eventually give back to if Harvard has        165    00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:47.820    taught us anything it is that although        166    00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.150    structure can be comforting finding        167    00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.680    oneself sitting at a bar and a        168    00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.180    Polynesian restaurant in Miami Beach        169    00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.919    with no idea what you're doing that can        170    00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:58.020    also be comforting is that we should        171    00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.800    perhaps limit our eventual use as we go        172    00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.380    out into the world I hope that we might        173    00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.650    turn our somedays into today's and our        174    00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.889    eventual ease into nouns that's where my        175    00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:13.139    speech was supposed to end but the more        176    00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:13.860    I thought about it the more        177    00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.900    uncomfortable I felt about that ending I        178    00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.669    can't spout wisdom or provide        179    00:08:17.669 --> 00:08:20.190    perspective on the same age as all of        180    00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.509    you and I'm just as nervous and        181    00:08:21.509 --> 00:08:24.660    uncertain about the world as you are the        182    00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.099    Lampoon writer in me would much rather        183    00:08:26.099 --> 00:08:28.440    keep it light and tell jokes about        184    00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.590    president Faust and Halloway haircut        185    00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:34.289    Greg Mankiw is God complex or the fact        186    00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:35.640    that none of us actually go to class        187    00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.029    then seriously reflect and Allah just        188    00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:40.709    urged us to avoid comfortable two-year        189    00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:43.349    programs as Erickson said I soon start        190    00:08:43.349 --> 00:08:45.180    working investment-banking and I just        191    00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.420    got into an HBS program literally called        192    00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.420    2+2        193    00:08:50.779 --> 00:08:53.400    maybe that completely invalidates my        194    00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.070    message and makes me a hypocrite but        195    00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.620    maybe not one thing I've learned at        196    00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.830    Harvard is to be wary of absolutes yes        197    00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.810    at some point instead of deciding what        198    00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.279    to do for the next two years we'll be        199    00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:08.420    deciding what to do with our lives but        200    00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.880    that point doesn't have to be today        201    00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.490    still whenever that point is I hope it        202    00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.650    is sooner rather than later and whatever        203    00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.140    that thing is that we're each going to        204    00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.430    do with the rest of our lives        205    00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.790    I hope so so so much that for each of us        206    00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.820    there's something that makes us happy        207    00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.820    gives us purpose excites us and does        208    00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.230    good thank        209    00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.730    you

     35    00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.119    honestly I don't go here like Andrea        36    00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.550    said I spent the last semester living in        37    00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.820    Chicago but before that I still didn't        38    00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.740    go here I've never been no Harvard        39    00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.540    student I just wanted to give the class        40    00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.810    a speech so thanks senior class        41    00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.350    committee I gotta say the past four        42    00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.750    years have been so different from what I        43    00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.870    imagined when I first started at Harvard        44    00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.640    back then I thought I would Forge deep        45    00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.550    relationships with all my professors but        46    00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.740    instead I took Matthew Kaiser to the        47    00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.660    freshman year faculty dinner and I told        48    00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.070    him way too much personal information        49    00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.450    back when I was a freshman I thought I        50    00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.220    would spend a lot of time in the stacks        51    00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.470    of Widener but I learned that the only        52    00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.239    people who spend time at Widener are        53    00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.239    murderers and people trying to have sex        54    00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.950    in the Judaica section that's when I was        55    00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.620    18 I thought I would run into drew        56    00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.950    Gilpin Faust on the street at least one        57    00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.120    time but that has not happened drew        58    00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.510    where are you        59    00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.650    is she is she here today on the stage no        60    00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.049    she's not maybe she's in the audience        61    00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.739    somewhere        62    00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.060    nothing I don't see her it's not just        63    00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.189    Harvard that is different from what I        64    00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:22.430    imagined when I started it's also the        65    00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.760    person I became while at Harvard as a        66    00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.470    freshman I couldn't wait to be a Poli        67    00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.260    Sci major until I found out that I        68    00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.239    couldn't be a Poli Sci major because it        69    00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.780    was called a gov concentrator and then I        70    00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.250    found out I couldn't be a gov        71    00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.470    concentrator because I only wanted to        72    00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.319    write think pieces about the Twilight        73    00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.450    novels so I switched to English maybe        74    00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.540    some of you guys started out in a        75    00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.040    concentration and switched to something        76    00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.709    that you didn't expect maybe you started        77    00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.049    out a math concentrator but you wanted        78    00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.690    to do something more useful so you        79    00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.810    switched to folklore mythology ha ha        80    00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.859    take that math nobody adds in the real        81    00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.099    world        82    00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.910    maybe you thought you would study        83    00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.190    chemistry but you switched to computer        84    00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.370    science after you took cs50 or you saw        85    00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.700    the social network maybe you thought you        86    00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.650    would study classics but you discovered        87    00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.290    a passion for sitting in a bathtub full        88    00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.470    of $20 bills while pouring gold coins        89    00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.020    and gemstones on your head and doing        90    00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.200    practice consulting case interviews so        91    00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.500    you switched to economics and you        92    00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.930    probably felt bad about straying from        93    00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.729    the path that you would set for yourself        94    00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.280    because I think we all have this idea        95    00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.139    that there's one correct path through        96    00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.330    life that we have to figure out and then        97    00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.750    follow but that is arbitrary and it's        98    00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.870    confining and it's wrong I refuse        99    00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.450    society's plan that I graduate find a        100    00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.979    company where I'll work for the rest of        101    00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.440    my life find a husband have a bunch of        102    00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.850    little babies and then die        103    00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.800    unless unless the husband in that        104    00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.050    scenario is the lead singer of Vampire        105    00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.860    Weekend in which case yes Society yes I        106    00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.110    will do my part to repopulate your ranks        107    00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.300    but in general I don't think that life        108    00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.710    is like a choose your own adventure        109    00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.009    novel where one choice inevitably leads        110    00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.350    to like you getting attached by little        111    00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.130    tiny alien monsters or worse losing your        112    00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.419    soul and going to Harvard Business        113    00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:43.660    School make the weirdest choices you        114    00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.699    want and the adventures are going to        115    00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.259    lead to you being 40 years old and okay        116    00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:51.160    just think about it        117    00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.740    all the best Harvard alumni have        118    00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.720    rejected the path that society set for        119    00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.050    them        120    00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.990    the poet Wallace Stevens had to spend        121    00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.060    most of his life working as an insurance        122    00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.419    agent and yet Helen bender talks about        123    00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:08.880    him like literally all the time yo-yo ma        124    00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.220    decided to play cello professionally        125    00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.080    which if you think about it is a        126    00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.180    horrible decision        127    00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.870    and yet he is famous successful and has        128    00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.850    seen drew faust in person he's living        129    00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.700    the dream        130    00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.710    Bill Gates didn't graduate from Harvard        131    00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.290    and he instead invented a world-changing        132    00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.900    computer that 90% of Harvard students        133    00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.350    don't use        134    00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.830    Harvard's Matt Damon's have been        135    00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.080    graduated and he is physically        136    00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:48.949    attractive and a Harvard student Abraham        137    00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.380    Lincoln didn't graduate because he        138    00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.620    didn't even go to Harvard and he just        139    00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.220    won the Oscar for Best Actor guys that        140    00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.580    could be you one day so don't listen to        141    00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.039    society's plan for you class of 2013        142    00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:07.100    Society is John they are responsible for        143    00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.449    the success of the Twilight novels and        144    00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:13.070    don't listen to your 18 year old self        145    00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.370    plan for your life either that person        146    00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.470    wasted so much time actually doing all        147    00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.990    of the reading for class what an eye you        148    00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.110    fool and now that you're graduating        149    00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.510    don't try to construct a narrative for        150    00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.940    the next 60 years of your life when        151    00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.460    you've only been alive for 22 and your        152    00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.590    brain has only been fully developed for        153    00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.150    negative 3        154    00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.639    there's a quote that I love writing a        155    00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:42.159    novel is like driving a car at night you        156    00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:43.780    can only see as far as your headlights        157    00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.789    but you can make the whole trip that way        158    00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:48.930    I think the same goes for life I        159    00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.919    personally have never written a novel        160    00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:53.710    but I have driven a car at night and I        161    00:07:53.710 --> 00:08:00.340    have never hit a person except twice so        162    00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.800    as Charles Darwin famously said        163    00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.800    evolution        164    00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:21.010    as Sigmund Freud said dreams as Walt        165    00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:26.410    Whitman said Yolo and as I'm saying        166    00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.380    right now look back on the past four        167    00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.900    years and be proud of how much you've        168    00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.360    changed and look forward at the rest of        169    00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.210    your life ready to make whatever weird        170    00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:41.710    scary choices make you happy one day        171    00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.169    class of 2013 you're all going to have        172    00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:46.870    an Oscar for Best Actor you're a star        173    00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.860    congratulations

   00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.080    this feels a little bit different from        2    00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.600    speaking in        3    00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.720    section but I'll do my        4    00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.800    best one day during spring        5    00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.719    break I went for a walk in Mount Auburn        6    00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.960    Cemetery wanding aimlessly between trees        7    00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.760    and        8    00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.520    Graves I stumbled upon a tombstone half        9    00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.640    buried in snow with an inscription that        10    00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.199    intrigued        11    00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.000    me Charles A Ditmas        12    00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.399    Jr        13    00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.199    1910        14    00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.199    2001 keeper of of the clocks of Harvard        15    00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.199    College        16    00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.280    cool I wanted to find out        17    00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.080    more it turns out that Charles was        18    00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.119    appointed by Harvard in the        19    00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.439    1940s to clean and maintain the        20    00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.079    University's many antique clocks which        21    00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.720    were scattered around campus in museums        22    00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.840    halls and        23    00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.320    Residences Charles was known on campus        24    00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.400    for his        25    00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.560    eccentric Behavior and the black tool        26    00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.000    bag he always carried with        27    00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.640    him he once gave the University Police a        28    00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.320    grandfather clock that belonged to        29    00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.079    another department claiming that the        30    00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.640    gift earned him the right to park        31    00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.920    anywhere on        32    00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.159    campus I'm sure the parents appreciate        33    00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.680    that        34    00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.280    Charles really loved        35    00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.680    clocks all clocks have their        36    00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.039    personalities he wrote        37    00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.840    their chronic ailments their        38    00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.280    individualities some speak so fast that        39    00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.399    one can scarcely hear them let alone        40    00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.239    understand what they        41    00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.200    say others are so ponderously slow        42    00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.319    almost unwilling to give their        43    00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.319    information still others are almost        44    00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.080    unsure of themselves they hesitate and        45    00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.280    seem to apologize when they speak one is        46    00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.360    reluctant to accept their        47    00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.120    words running his fingers along a        48    00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.120    clock's wood casing Charles would        49    00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.120    whisper how are you feeling        50    00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.319    today it would be easy to dismiss        51    00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.000    Charles as having an overactive        52    00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000    imagination but if you really think        53    00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.800    about it hearing voices in clocks is not        54    00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.760    that        55    00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.959    extraordinary upon seeing upon seeing a        56    00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.840    beautiful work of        57    00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.879    art we say it speaks to us inspiring        58    00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.560    stories touch us and hardship shakes us        59    00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.040    our feelings happen to us we do not will        60    00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.159    them in the same way that we do not walk        61    00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.400    into love we fall in love pulled by a        62    00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.200    force so powerful and so completely        63    00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.840    beyond our        64    00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.920    control what strikes me about Charles's        65    00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.400    relationship with        66    00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.599    clocks is that he never worried about        67    00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.599    what seems so obvious to the rest of        68    00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.239    us clocks tell        69    00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.720    time they symbolize the unceasing        70    00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.200    passage of time every second forward is        71    00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.040    a unique moment lost to        72    00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.560    Eternity Charles was unfazed by the        73    00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.640    passage of time because he was in rap        74    00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.760    captured by the inner engineering of the        75    00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.560    clock and the Elegance of its casing        76    00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.319    that is why he hated battery clocks and        77    00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.439    electric clocks they had no soul no        78    00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.640    feeling they were more precise trer to        79    00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.600    time but he could not talk to        80    00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.400    them you        81    00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.479    see Charles simply liked the feeling of        82    00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.479    a clock's thck it's texture and the        83    00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.960    story it told if you probe him further        84    00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.880    and asked him why he liked these he        85    00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.280    might shrug and        86    00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.160    say I just do one cannot rationalize it        87    00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.280    it was simply        88    00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.440    intuitive a        89    00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.680    feeling now what does this have to do        90    00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.440    with        91    00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.840    commencement H um well commencement        92    00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.440    today refers to a        93    00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.800    beginning but in fact the word        94    00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.199    commencement comes from the Latin K        95    00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.800    together and initi to        96    00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.960    initiate we are being initiated together        97    00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.520    thrown forward into new        98    00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.000    worlds it's easy to see this day as one        99    00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.199    would look at a        100    00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.800    clock clocks tell time commencement        101    00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.759    tells        102    00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:25.199    time the passage from one age to the        103    00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.919    next what is harder is to see a clock        104    00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.120    and our commencement as outside of time        105    00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.680    it is hard because we seek to understand        106    00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.440    time time time we seek to control        107    00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.160    it but the passage of time like much in        108    00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:54.800    life lies Beyond us it lies beyond our        109    00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.000    reach we do not control where we are        110    00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.479    born        111    00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.600    we do not control when we are born and        112    00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.919    death is not a        113    00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.960    choice fear anxiety and hope are only        114    00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.360    natural responses to the utter vastness        115    00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.599    and uncertainty of the universe these        116    00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:19.560    feelings flow inside all of        117    00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.680    us and they should guide        118    00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.880    us on this day of        119    00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.840    commencement we can listen to        120    00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.520    them amidst        121    00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.240    the        122    00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.639    trees the red bricks the infinite sky        123    00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:35.599    above        124    00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:39.000    us we can listen to their breath and        125    00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.639    they can lead us to unexpected        126    00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:48.160    places and if we listen carefully        127    00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.479    enough even the plainest things can        128    00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:56.240    become the source of infinite joy and        129    00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.400    wonder a clap of        130    00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.000    thunder        131    00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.680    the beating of your        132    00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.160    heart even an old        133    00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:31.319    clock

Josie Duffy I        25    00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.240    think I speak for all of the graduates        26    00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.200    when I say that today feels weird it        27    00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.939    sounds cliche but it does seem like just        28    00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:23.530    last week that we were sitting in        29    00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.299    Memorial Hall listening to Dean Minow        30    00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.210    speak during orientation and I remember        31    00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.070    listening to her read out the amazing        32    00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.710    accomplishments of our class and feeling        33    00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.079    completely under prepared and under        34    00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.329    accomplished and I remember this        35    00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.729    unparalleled moment of comedic timing        36    00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.799    when I looked down and I noticed that I        37    00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.570    had my sweater on inside out        38    00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.170    I then remember what imagining what I        39    00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.880    was going to tell my parents when the        40    00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.799    admissions office inevitably cornered me        41    00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.360    and told me that they had made a mistake        42    00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.509    and that was just the first of a number        43    00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.159    of moments filled with these deep        44    00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.770    feelings of inadequacy there is the        45    00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.750    first day of class for example which as        46    00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.259    my section six will remember perfect        47    00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.980    professor Rosenberg came in ten        48    00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.140    early kind of bounded to the front of        49    00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.180    the classroom and began our entire law        50    00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.000    school experience with a couple of        51    00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.160    unceremonious words which were okay        52    00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.120    let's get to work he picked up a seating        53    00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.220    chart and I was terrified and I thought        54    00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.640    okay if he calls on me I'll get up and        55    00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.710    I'll walk out of the door and I'll go        56    00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.260    catch the bus back to Georgia and I'll        57    00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.490    pretend this Law School thing never        58    00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.610    happened but he didn't call on me and it        59    00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.140    turns out that professor Rosenberg        60    00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.900    wasn't nearly as scary as he seemed by        61    00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.540    the end of the fall I found him        62    00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.910    downright endearing and I even tried to        63    00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.800    hug him once although he politely        64    00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.340    rebuffed me and some of those people        65    00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.050    that Dean Minow talked about that day        66    00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.910    those people who had cured diseases and        67    00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.740    written books and ruled small countries        68    00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.810    a lot of them ended up being some of my        69    00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.510    friends but that's not actually why I        70    00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.160    came to talk to you today because I        71    00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.780    wanted to talk to the graduates about        72    00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.030    another moment in Memorial Hall the one        73    00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.650    that actually Dean Minow just mentioned        74    00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.720    the moment where Dean Minow said we        75    00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.750    searched the world for you that was a        76    00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.340    big moment for me and I remember feeling        77    00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.520    completely thrilled and also totally        78    00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.140    overwhelmed with the idea that a place        79    00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.060    like Harvard Law School had searched the        80    00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.390    world and found me but I wasn't actually        81    00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.510    that hard to find and none of us were        82    00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.010    the fact that we were even in Dean        83    00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.290    Meadows landscape at all speaks to how        84    00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.600    blessed and how remarkably lucky we are        85    00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.330    I don't mean to say that we haven't        86    00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.610    worked hard because we have all of us        87    00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.770    but if law school has taught me one        88    00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.530    thing it's that hard work and good luck        89    00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.040    are not mutually exclusive so here's the        90    00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.720    part in the graduation speech where I        91    00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.090    talk about responsibility and I have to        92    00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.130    say it to you all now all you guys are        93    00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.110    sort of forced to listen to me before        94    00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.670    you all go off and get really important        95    00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.020    jobs and I have to contact your        96    00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.650    secretary to get on your schedule        97    00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.480    the law is noble but it is not perfect        98    00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.739    it is good but it is not always just our        99    00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.780    laws are made by people just like you        100    00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.110    and I not by gods and so my hope for us        101    00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.780    as lawyers is that we do listen to the        102    00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.269    law of course but that we also listen to        103    00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.799    our brain and our        104    00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.290    I hope we acknowledge when something        105    00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.050    makes us uneasy that we speak up when        106    00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.020    something feels wrong in law school they        107    00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.180    teach you to think like a lawyer but I        108    00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.070    hope in the process we don't forget to        109    00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.790    also think like human beings I hope that        110    00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.740    we allow ourselves to hold fast and what        111    00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.600    we believe in but that we have the        112    00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.910    dignity and the humility to change our        113    00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.940    minds that we remember that often        114    00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.040    experience is more valuable than        115    00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.280    eloquence that we do not always equate        116    00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.680    logic with strength that we do not        117    00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.490    always equate emotion with weakness we        118    00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.230    live in a time where information is so        119    00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.480    accessible where things go from novel        120    00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.280    too tired to cliche in a matter of        121    00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.070    seconds and I fear that irony is easier        122    00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.930    than earnestness for all of us and that        123    00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.260    skepticism can be easier than faith I        124    00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.850    hope that we retain that inner current        125    00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.160    of idealism that will sometimes get us        126    00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.760    called naive or unrealistic and my hope        127    00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.500    for us is that when we confront legal        128    00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.330    problems we don't just think about the        129    00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.660    law the law after all is often binary        130    00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.600    and I don't want us to be binary I hope        131    00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.669    that we recognize that part of beauty is        132    00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.430    in nuance and complication but sometimes        133    00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.500    there may be two answers or no answers        134    00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.840    that fairness does not have to exclude        135    00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.419    efficiency that good things have bad        136    00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.310    sides like good people make bad mistakes        137    00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.400    that good rules can have bad results but        138    00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.460    it's not as simple as good or bad good        139    00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.830    and evil right or wrong or right or left        140    00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.160    and that is what is amazing about life        141    00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.120    it's not simple the grace is in the gray        142    00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.450    area if you ever need to feel        143    00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.430    unimportant remember the good billion        144    00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.560    people who are living now or have lived        145    00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.380    throughout history superlatives will not        146    00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.290    sustain you if you narrow your focus to        147    00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.110    being the best the most or the first you        148    00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.000    will never knock that feeling that at        149    00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.340    some point someone did or could or will        150    00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.520    do it better than you and I don't know        151    00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.810    about you all but I'm very different        152    00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.780    than I was three years ago for one I now        153    00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.840    own snow boots um but I also went        154    00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.849    through a period where I swore that law        155    00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:29.980    school wasn't for me        156    00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.930    and in a moment of what the law calls        157    00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.420    temporary insanity I called my father        158    00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.850    and I told him that I no longer wanted        159    00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.230    to be a lawyer I now wanted to be a        160    00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.620    writer and I heard a very long silence        161    00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.260    before he said how many semesters of        162    00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.150    tuition did you pay before you figure        163    00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.480    that out        164    00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.330    turns out that I was wrong because after        165    00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.220    all being a lawyer can augment Who I am        166    00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.220    it doesn't have to define it so my hope        167    00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.960    for us is that we choose not to just be        168    00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.450    lawyers my hope for us is that we choose        169    00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.090    to be fighters and peacemakers preachers        170    00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.340    and engineers that we choose to be        171    00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.850    artists imagining how things could be        172    00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.140    that we choose to be architects who        173    00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.780    create and workers who build and that we        174    00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.900    choose to be writers and I hope that we        175    00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.430    think about all of those people that        176    00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.770    don't have the opportunity that we have        177    00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.220    and I mean really think about them        178    00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.570    Harvard is a place of privilege and the        179    00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.940    truth is the more we cake the harder it        180    00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.270    is to remember the taste of bread to put        181    00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.160    it simply there is no such thing as an        182    00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.500    even playing field we are five hundred        183    00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.630    some-odd people of the seven billion        184    00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.160    people in the world and at this very        185    00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.530    moment there are people just as smarter        186    00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.630    it's just as smart as us or smarter all        187    00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.330    over this planet who do not have the        188    00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.970    same luck that we have people who do not        189    00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.920    have the resources the opportunity or        190    00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.590    the freedom even others who are fighting        191    00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.570    wars working in factories or tilling        192    00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.970    land others who do not have the right to        193    00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.650    go to school because of their gender or        194    00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.010    their class or their citizenship they        195    00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.140    live far away but also closer than we        196    00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.790    probably realized and they are trying to        197    00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.500    figure out how to live in this world        198    00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.790    much less change it graduating from this        199    00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.260    place means that people are going to        200    00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.120    give us a terrifying amount of power I        201    00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.260    really hope that each of us takes that        202    00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.080    power as opportunity opportunity for us        203    00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.180    to help a person or a neighborhood or a        204    00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.060    country and that means not just helping        205    00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.380    out once a year and it means not just        206    00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.169    donating money and when we help out we        207    00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:34.360    must also watch out help has a way of        208    00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.580    veering into patronization if you're not        209    00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.479    careful the past few years have been        210    00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:42.849    about us our grades are        211    00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:45.790    clerkships our firm offers our laments        212    00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.670    over not enough sushi in the heart but        213    00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.019    at the end of the day the legal        214    00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:53.620    profession is not about us at all so        215    00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.810    don't let yourself get tired don't let        216    00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:57.490    yourself get bitter and don't wake up        217    00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.380    one day and realize that you let        218    00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.930    yourself get too hard        219    00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:05.279    access your reservoirs of compassion the        220    00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:07.509    funny part about me standing up here at        221    00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:09.790    all is that I'm 26 so spoiler alert I        222    00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.430    know pretty much nothing at all but I        223    00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.350    believe plenty of things and I believe        224    00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.800    in the fight I believe in what dr. King        225    00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.370    called creative extremism so today I        226    00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.110    wanted to ask all of you to fight long        227    00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.920    and hard for what you believe in so many        228    00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.690    people fought for me to get this degree        229    00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.120    and I think of them today I think of my        230    00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.680    great grandfather who graduated from        231    00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.899    college in 1926 and wanted to go to law        232    00:09:34.899 --> 00:09:36.759    school but couldn't find one that would        233    00:09:36.759 --> 00:09:39.310    accept a black man I think of my        234    00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.490    grandmother who is here she's 92 now but        235    00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.829    as a black woman in Texas in the 1930s        236    00:09:44.829 --> 00:09:47.019    she publicly campaigned against the poll        237    00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:49.839    tax it wasn't safe and it wasn't easy        238    00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:55.170    but it was right I think about my mother        239    00:09:58.019 --> 00:10:05.500    this is the proto's worried about okay I        240    00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.810    think about my mother who balanced hard        241    00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.149    work and herd mothering with wisdom and        242    00:10:10.149 --> 00:10:13.509    humor and most notably patience and I        243    00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:15.579    think about my father who when I was a        244    00:10:15.579 --> 00:10:17.050    kid in Italy and I would sit on his lap        245    00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.720    and he would talk about South Africa and        246    00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.720    South Central he would talk about public        247    00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.560    education and public housing and he'd        248    00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.180    talk about problems and also about        249    00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.160    solutions and ever since I was a little        250    00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.240    girl he would tell me it was my        251    00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.250    responsibility to make sure that I made        252    00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.279    things better how great is it that we're        253    00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:37.660    getting this degree that will let us        254    00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.600    make things better I hope I never forget        255    00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.050    to do that        256    00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.480    thanks I give me a second to calm down I        257    00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.709    hope I never forget to do that and I        258    00:10:57.709 --> 00:10:59.380    hope that you all don't either on a        259    00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.269

is        278    00:11:44.209 --> 00:11:48.529    young jeezy who is either a rapper or a        279    00:11:48.529 --> 00:11:50.389    Supreme Court justice I'm not sure which        280    00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:53.180    but he said you only get one life        281    00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.329    there is no sequel and the second quote        282    00:11:56.329 --> 00:11:58.250    is from that first day of class when        283    00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.290    professor Rosenberg walked to the bottom        284    00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:02.389    of the classroom looked at

She was, like, crumping and        338    00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:39.080    throwing back some money into the crowd...        339    00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.700    I'm gonna take some liberties.        340    00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.570    In the days ahead a lot of people will    tell you to trust your instincts        341    00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:48.660    And don't be afraid to take chances        342    00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.100    and I am definitely one of those people        343    00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.240    but i would also say this        344    00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.800    don't rush into the next phase of your    life        345    00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.260    whether it's        346    00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.630    grad school at Harvard or it's        347    00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.250    grad school at MIT or        348    00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:08.260    massively disappointing your parents with an art made out of garbage thing...        349    00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.420    Whatever it is you try,        350    00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.929    Make sure it's what you really want to do.        351    00:21:12.929 --> 00:21:15.799    because the only person who knows what    that is        352    00:21:15.799 --> 00:21:17.930    is you        353    00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:21.450    and if all else fails just remember    these beautiful words from the film, ""Dead Poet's Society"".        354    00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:28.450    ""Neil! My Neil is dead! My boy!""        355    00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:40.490    which now that I have said out loud        356    00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:45.410    did not quite drive home my point as    much as I had hoped        357    00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:49.090    In fact I'm realizing that only like    seven percent of what I've said today        358    00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:51.300    has been at all helpful        359    00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.649    or even passable as english        360    00:21:54.649 --> 00:21:58.770    but in the end i feel I'm only truly    qualified to give you three simple tips        361    00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.740    on how to succeed in life        362    00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.279    one        363    00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:09.279    cut a hole in a box        364    00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:15.970    put your junk in said box        365    00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.480    make her or him        366    00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.570    open the box        367    00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:21.890    and that's        368    00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:26.660    the way you do it        369    00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:32.059    Also, I can't believe I'm about to say this, but Dean Hammonds, I forgive you,         370    00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:34.810    bygones be bygones        371    00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:38.100    already got that sweet degree from Santa    Cruz and        372    00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.809    film school anyway so thank you graduates!        373    00:22:40.809 --> 00:22:43.649    Godspeed and congratulations.

Thank you.        51    00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.599    Harvard was for me a dazzling    revelation        52    00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.919    contrary to the conventional wisdom on    this campus it is possible to get a        53    00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.839    fine education at Yale, which i did        54    00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:14.290    but the great graduate programs of    Harvard in their scope, in their         55    00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.599    scale, in their  worldliness and    ambition were just        56    00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.579    an electric experience and i soaked    it in        57    00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.989    Now, to get a Ph.D. involves many many    hours of grueling work        58    00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.389    it also involves many hours of goofing    off        59    00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:35.159    acquiring hobbies and interests and    uh... exploiting the great resources of        60    00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:36.569    this university        61    00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.059    i mean the libraries and the cafes        62    00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:40.789    and I did all of that        63    00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.660    and gained from it immeasurably. I learned from        64    00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.319    faculty, from students, from visitors        65    00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.399    but what I remember most        66    00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:52.639    was that Harvard is the place that I    learned to think        67    00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.699    and owe this university as a result        68    00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.049    a deep debt of gratitude        69    00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.879    something I think all of you share with    me        70    00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:06.689    and something the development office    will remind you all from time to time        71    00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.469    I've always been wary of making    commencement speeches. I don't think of        72    00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:10.370    myself        73    00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.049    as old enough to        74    00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.879    really have any wisdom to impart,        75    00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.909    but there's nothing like having children    to remind you of how old you are. My        76    00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:21.380    nine-year-old daughter is here with me now        77    00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.789    uh... or to remind you about deeply uncool you are        78    00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:25.939    so I'm gonna        79    00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:28.930    take on this task with some trepidation.        80    00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.009    The best commencement speech I ever        81    00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.810    heard, or heard of        82    00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.250    was by Art Buchwald, the humorist. His address was short, was brief.        83    00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.199    He simply said        84    00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.999    ladies and gentlemen remember we are    leaving you a perfect world        85    00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:47.259    don't screw it up.        86    00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.480    Now you are not likely to hear that    message much these days.        87    00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.680    Instead you're likely to hear that we    are living in green economic times        88    00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.259    the graduates are going to be told that    they are graduating into the slowest,        89    00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:01.019    economic recovery since World War Two        90    00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:03.030    and it's not just economic worries        91    00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.449    ever since nine eleven we have been    worried about terrorism,        92    00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.970    fearful of the dangers of new attacks,        93    00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.990    that have in many ways altered our daily lives.        94    00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.789    Then there are larger concerns you hear    about        95    00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.189    the earth is getting hotter, we're    running out of water, a billion people        96    00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:22.070    are trapped in terrible poverty.        97    00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.940    So I want to sketch out for you        98    00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.199    perhaps with a little bit of historical    perspective        99    00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:29.770    the world as I see it.        100    00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.689    The world we live in his first of all    at peace        101    00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:34.129    profoundly so        102    00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:38.990    the richest countries of the world are    not in major geopolitical, geomilitary        103    00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.850    competition with one another        104    00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.220    no arms races, no proxy races, no    wars, no cold wars among the        105    00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.120    richest countries of the world.        106    00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.179    You would have to go back        107    00:05:48.179 --> 00:05:49.600    hundreds of years        108    00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.149    to find an equivalent period of    political stability.        109    00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:54.230    I know that you        110    00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.590    see a bomb going off in Afghanistan or    hear of a terror plot in New York        111    00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.229    and worry about        112    00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.879    the safety and security of         113    00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:06.130    our times.        114    00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.009    But here is the data:        115    00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.289    the number of people who have died as a result of war, civil war, and yes,        116    00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:13.509    terrorism,        117    00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:16.080    is down fifty percent this decade        118    00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.979    from the 1990s        119    00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:22.659    it is down seventy five percent from the    preceding five decades. It is down of        120    00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:26.569    course the ninety nine percent from the    decade before that which was World War        121    00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:27.999    Two.        122    00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:32.580    Steven Pinker argues that we are living    in the most peaceful times        123    00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.970    in human history.        124    00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.479    And he should know because he is a    Harvard professor.        125    00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:41.750    The political stability that we've    experienced has allowed the creation of        126    00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.780    a single global economy        127    00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.069    that has allowed        128    00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:47.330    countries from all over the world        129    00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.740    to participate and flourish.        130    00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.720    In 1980 the number of    countries that were growing up four        131    00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.459    percent a year, with robust growth        132    00:06:55.459 --> 00:06:57.220    was about sixteen.        133    00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.419    By 2007 that number    had doubled        134    00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:04.849    and even after the financial    crisis that number stands today        135    00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:07.360    at about eighty.        136    00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.560    Countries around the world are thriving    and flourishing in a way        137    00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.039    that was previously unimaginable.        138    00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:16.800    Even in the current decade with all    its slow growth        139    00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.380    the global economy as a whole would grow    ten to twenty percent faster than it did        140    00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.669    last decade        141    00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:25.999    sixty-percent faster than it did two    decades ago        142    00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:30.009    and five times as fast as it did three    decades ago.        143    00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:32.680    The result is that the united nations    estimates        144    00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.079    in the last fifty years        145    00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:37.980    poverty has been reduced more than in    the preceding        146    00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.559    five hundred years.        147    00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:43.030    Most of that reduction has taken place    in the last twenty.        148    00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.830    The average Chinese person is today ten    times richer        149    00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.059    that he or she was fifty years ago        150    00:07:49.059 --> 00:07:52.330    with twenty five years more of life    expectancy.        151    00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.409    Life expectancy has risen across the    world        152    00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:56.749    dramatically.        153    00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:58.089    we gain        154    00:07:58.089 --> 00:08:00.939    five hours of life expectancy        155    00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:06.839    everyday. Imagine that, without even    exercising!        156    00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:09.889    a court of all the babies born in the    developed world        157    00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:12.210    this year        158    00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.649    will live to be a hundred.        159    00:08:14.649 --> 00:08:18.599    All this is, of course, because of rising    standards of living of hygiene and        160    00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:20.069    medicine.        161    00:08:20.069 --> 00:08:22.889    Atul Gawande, another Harvard    professor        162    00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:24.930    who was also a practicing surgeon,        163    00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.240    who also writes for the New Yorker    magazine tells of a nineteenth century        164    00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.079    operation perhaps not so one common        165    00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:33.409    In this case, the surgeon was trying to amputate        166    00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:34.890    the patient's leg.        167    00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.370    He succeeded.        168    00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:40.730    He also, however, amputated his assistant's    hand.        169    00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.500    The two patients, I suppose one would call    them        170    00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.120    died of sepsis.        171    00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.510    An onlooker died of shock.        172    00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:53.150    It is the only known medical procedure    to have a three hundred percent fatality.        173    00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.060    We've come a long way.        174    00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.160    To understand the astonishing age of    progress        175    00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.189    just look at the cell phones you have in    your pockets.        176    00:09:02.189 --> 00:09:04.949    and yes, I know many of you don't have    them in your pockets -- they are already out,        177    00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:08.100    and you are looking at them right now.        178    00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.800    That cell phone has more computing power    than the Apollo space capsule that went        179    00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.920    to the moon.        180    00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.320    That capsule couldn't even tweet.        181    00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.210    So imagine the opportunities that lie    ahead.        182    00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:24.230    Moore's Law, which says that computing    power will double every eighteen months        183    00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.620    while costs have        184    00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.230    may be petering out        185    00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.369    in the realm of information technology.        186    00:09:29.369 --> 00:09:32.640    But there are other arenas in which it    is accelerating.        187    00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.220    The human genome is being sequenced    at a pace faster        188    00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.650    than Moore's Law.        189    00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.100    A third industrial revolution involving    material science        190    00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.420    and the customization of manufacturing        191    00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.400    is yet in its infancy.        192    00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.690    And all of these fields are beginning to    intersect and produce new opportunities in        193    00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.470    ways that we can't even imagine.        194    00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:57.560    The good news goes on. Look at the number    of graduates globally from colleges.        195    00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.290    That number has risen four-fold in the    last forty years for men.        196    00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:05.430    It has risen sevenfold for women.        197    00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.020    And if you're wondering        198    00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.530    whether or not that age old question how    women smarter than men has been answered,        199    00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.759    the evidence is now overwhelming.        200    00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:19.560    The answer is yes.        201    00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.520    My favorite example of this is that there    was a study done        202    00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.850    That over the last twenty five years        203    00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.940    female representatives, members of the    House of Representatives have had        204    00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:34.390    managed to get forty nine million    dollars more in federal grant money        205    00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.030    than their male counterparts.        206    00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.950    So even at        207    00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.890    pork barrel spending it turns out women    are better than men.        208    00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:45.139    And so i look forward from the villages    in Africa to the board rooms of America        209    00:10:45.139 --> 00:10:49.269    To the increasing participation of women    which is going to enrich and ennoble our        210    00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:50.480    world.        211    00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:55.800    Now you might listen to all this and say        212    00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.870    You might listen to all this and say, well, this    is all a very good for the world but        213    00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.250    what does it mean for America?        214    00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:05.730    Well, a world at peace brought prosperity,    the rise of the rest        215    00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.400    is going to be particularly good for the    United States        216    00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.460    because let me remind you this is the    country with the largest and most        217    00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.240    dynamic economy in the world        218    00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.470    that hosts        219    00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.800    hundreds of the world's greatest    companies        220    00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.700    that dominates the age of technology        221    00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:27.030    It has almost all of the world's    great universities        222    00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:31.880    There is in China and India no Harvard    and there will not be for decades,        223    00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.560    perhaps ever.        224    00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.290    the United States is also a vital    society        225    00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.780    It is the only country in the industrialized world        226    00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.930    that is demographically vibrant.        227    00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.730    We add three million people to this    country every year.        228    00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.560    That is itself a powerful life force,        229    00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.830    and it is made stronger by the fact        230    00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:54.750    that so many of these people are    immigrants.        231    00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:59.050    They... I should say, we come to this country with    aspirations, with drive, with        232    00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:04.100    determination and we develop a fierce    love of this country.        233    00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.900    America in 2050 will    have a better demographic profile than        234    00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.310    China.        235    00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.560    So this country has its problems,        236    00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.829    but i would rather have America's    problems        237    00:12:14.829 --> 00:12:21.829    than most any other countries in the    world.        238    00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.680    When I tell you that we're living in    an astonishing age of progress, I am        239    00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.670    not urging complacency, far from it.        240    00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:37.540    We have been through a century of    extraordinary troubles:        241    00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.200    world wars        242    00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.590    depressions        243    00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.420    cold wars and dozens of other smaller    challenges        244    00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:48.440    but each of those challenges has been    matched by a response.        245    00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.999    Human action and human achievement have    managed to take on        246    00:12:51.999 --> 00:12:52.939    and best        247    00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:54.560    terrible problems.        248    00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.420    We forget our successes        249    00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.090    in 2009        250    00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.270    the H1N1 virus broke out in    Mexico.        251    00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.780    Now, if you look back at the trajectory    of these kinds of viruses        252    00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.730    it's quite conceivable that this one    would have spread like the asian flu        253    00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.149    of 1957        254    00:13:10.149 --> 00:13:11.690    or 1968        255    00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:15.110    which cost four million lives.        256    00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:18.170    But this time, the Mexican health    authorities identified the problem early,        257    00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.680    shared the information with the World    Health Organization        258    00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.269    learned best practices        259    00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:26.539    tracked down where the outbreak took place,    quarantined people,        260    00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:28.230    vaccinated others.        261    00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.520    The country went on a full-scale alert        262    00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.240    in a very Catholic country        263    00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.180    it was not allowed to go to church        264    00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.550    for three Sundays.        265    00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.440    Perhaps more importantly you couldn't go    to a soccer game        266    00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.000    for three weeks.        267    00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.720    But the result was        268    00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.660    that the virus was contained        269    00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.580    to the point where three months later    people asked what was the fuss and        270    00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.980    wondered whether we had overreacted.        271    00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.860    We hadn't overreacted.        272    00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.410    We had reacted.        273    00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.030    We have responded.        274    00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.380    And we had dealt with the problem.        275    00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.030    There are other examples.        276    00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.760    In the twelve months following the    economic peak in 2008        277    00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.610    industrial production worldwide fell as    much as it did        278    00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:09.090    in the first year of the great    depression.        279    00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:13.280    Equity prices and global trade actually    fell more.        280    00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.060    Yet this time no great depression followed.        281    00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.840    Why? Because of the coordinated actions of    governments around the world.        282    00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.149    9/11 did not usher in         283    00:14:23.149 --> 00:14:25.820    an age of terrorism with Al Qaeda        284    00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.800    going from strength to strength.        285    00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.420    Why? Because countries cooperated in    fighting them and other terrorists around        286    00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.550    the world with considerable success.        287    00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.290    When we come together        288    00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.020    when we put aside our petty differences        289    00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.710    when we cooperate        290    00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.890    the results are astounding.        291    00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.970    So when we look at all these problems we    face economic crises, terrorism,        292    00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.520    climate change, resource scarcity-        293    00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.730    keep in mind        294    00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.500    that these are real problems        295    00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.770    but that the human reaction and response    to them will be real.        296    00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.940    you can easily map out the big problem        297    00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.710    but it's much more difficult        298    00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:06.910    to map out the thousands of individual    actions that governments, firms,        299    00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.509    organizations, researchers, scientists,        300    00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:11.650    and ordinary people will take        301    00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.750    that will collectively constitute        302    00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.830    the solution.        303    00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.250    In a sense I'm betting on the graduates    of this great university.        304    00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:22.480    I believe that your actions will have    consequences.        305    00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.180    your efforts will make a difference.        306    00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.679    And according to the graduates I know of    this kind of event,        307    00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:30.340    I'm supposed to provide some advice.        308    00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.140    So, should you go into nanotechnology or    bioengineering        309    00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.120    and the answer is that I haven't a clue.        310    00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.640    I honestly don't know what the great    trends of the future or industries of        311    00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.430    the future will be.        312    00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:47.070    But I do know one thing: that human    beings will probably continue to reward        313    00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:50.380    those talents of heart and mind that    they have always rewarded for        314    00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.170    thousands of years.        315    00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:56.090    Intelligence, hard work, discipline, courage,        316    00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:57.430    perhaps above all        317    00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.290    love and faith        318    00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:00.740    these are the things        319    00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.480    that at the end of the day make for a    great life; one that is rewarded by the        320    00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.310    outside world.        321    00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:10.440    An equally importantly a good life one    that is rewarded by only those you know        322    00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.000    best.        323    00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.570    These are the virtues that people honor.        324    00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:19.450    These are the virtues that people have    built statues for five thousand years        325    00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:23.950    and to which they will be statues for    the next five thousand years... well nobody        326    00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:28.520    does statues anymore. They build weird, metal, modernist sculptures with        327    00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:35.070    strange doodads hanging    off them but you get my general point.        328    00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:38.490    Trust yourself. You know what kind of    life you should live. You don't need an        329    00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.660    ethics course to tell you what not to do.        330    00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.620    Trust in your instincts and you will    build a great life        331    00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.120    you will build a good life        332    00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.220    and you will change the world.        333    00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.420    You know, I said at my age that I don't    have written much specific wisdom to        334    00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.520    impart        335    00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.190    I have one final piece of advice        336    00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.780    for the graduates        337    00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.760    and it is a piece of advice that is    gained from        338    00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.490    experience not books.        339    00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.459    Trust me about this.        340    00:17:05.459 --> 00:17:10.140    You will never understand how much your    parents love you until you have children        341    00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.559    of your own.        342    00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:15.630    Once you have children of your own,        343    00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:20.000    once you have children of your own, all    that strange behavior- the stalking, the        344    00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.900    worrying- it all makes sense.        345    00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.510    But do me a favor        346    00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:27.260    don't wait so long.        347    00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:31.140    My mother lives eight thousand miles    away and I think about this every day.        348    00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.100    Don't wait so long.        349    00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:37.830    Get up today of all days and hug your    parents and tell them you love them.        350    00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.690    Thank you ladies and gentlemen, and to the graduates of Harvard, godspeed.

course        34    00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.800    religion 1513 a history of harvard and        35    00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.079    its presidents        36    00:13:10.079 --> 00:13:13.360    taught by the late reverend peter gomes        37    00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.040    a legendary        38    00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.680    a legendary character and presence at        39

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.120    nostalgic value and        43    00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.399    moderate workload        44    00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.800    i thoroughly enjoyed it and the course        45    00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.880    took on greater significance        46    00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.959    after reverend gomes passed away        47    00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:37.760    in february two thousand eleven        48    00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.279    it would be the last time that he taught        49    00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:40.800    the course        50    00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.639    the last semester he'd invite students        51    00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:44.160    over for tea        52    00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.160    or challenge us to hunt boston for the        53    00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.720    grave of john harvard or deliver a        54    00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.720    lecture from the president's chair in        55    00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.519    university hall        56    00:13:53.839 --> 00:13:55.360    i had looked forward to him speaking        57    00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.320    today        58    00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.480    at my own commencement        59    00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.320    and although this is the second        60    00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.519    commencement where his booming voice and        61    00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:05.440    paddington bear-like persona will be        62    00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.199    missed        63    00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:09.760    i felt it a great opportunity        64    00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.959    to reflect        65    00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:12.240    on the history        66    00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.560    of our university        67    00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.040    if there is one lesson we can learn from        68    00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.720    reverend gomes        69    00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.800    it's that harvard is a place        70    00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.760    of contradictions        71    00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:26.399    take for example the history of women at        72    00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:28.079    harvard        73    00:14:28.079 --> 00:14:29.839    although we were a college founded        74    00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:31.680    exclusively for men        75    00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.920    it was the religious agitations of anne        76    00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.440    hutchinson        77    00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.959    that motivated the leaders of the        78    00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:39.519    massachusetts bay colony to establish an        79    00:14:39.519 --> 00:14:42.839    institution able to suppress such        80    00:14:42.839 --> 00:14:44.480    dissent        81    00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.040    the first scholarships for the college        82    00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.800    were established by a woman        83    00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.920    lady ann radcliffe molson        84    00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.000    and the largest building in our presence        85    00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.920    weidner library        86    00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.480    was commissioned and overseen by a        87    00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.839    mother        88    00:14:59.839 --> 00:15:02.560    at a time when her own daughter        89    00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.320    wouldn't have been allowed to set foot        90    00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.639    inside        91    00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:09.040    or take the question of public versus        92    00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.800    private        93    00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.560    reverend gomes was always quick to point        94    00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.880    out that we were founded through an act        95    00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.760    of a public legislature        96    00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.680    seeking to build upon the collective        97    00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.120    will of the community        98    00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.240    to perpetuate its values        99    00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.760    another paradox balancing the sacred and        100    00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.240    the secular        101    00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.120    we were founded in a deep puritan        102    00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.639    tradition        103    00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:36.720    at a time when the concept        104    00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.959    of separation of church and state        105    00:15:38.959 --> 00:15:41.680    did not exist        106    00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.519    up until the civil war        107    00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:48.639    17 of our 20 presidents were clergymen        108    00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.040    and yet by the 1880s when president        109    00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.920    eliot decided to make morning prayer        110    00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:54.880    optional        111    00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.759    instead of mandatory        112    00:15:57.759 --> 00:15:59.600    critics called us        113    00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.160    godless harvard        114    00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.079    godless we may be religion still        115    00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:05.920    pervades our university        116    00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.519    evidenced even        117    00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:09.440    by much of the ceremony at today's        118    00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.920    commencement        119    00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.199    we were a college that was more        120    00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:15.199    influenced by the great awakening        121    00:16:15.199 --> 00:16:18.160    than the american revolution        122    00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.079    after general george washington's troops        123    00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:22.560    ransacked massachusetts hall        124    00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.000    harvard college        125    00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.560    demonstrating great shrewdness        126    00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.320    prepared two lawsuits        127    00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.120    one        128    00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.839    in case the british one        129    00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.199    one in case the british one the other in        130    00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:42.240    case the americans won        131    00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:44.240    and for me one of the beauties of        132    00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.279    harvard        133    00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:47.040    is the persistence of such        134    00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.279    contradictions        135    00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:51.279    we are a place        136    00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:53.759    we are a place that a first generation        137    00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:56.160    college student and a fourth generation        138    00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.199    legacy can each call home        139    00:16:59.199 --> 00:17:00.880    a school where someone who enters as a        140    00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.639    pre-med can leave an art history        141    00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:05.280    concentrator        142    00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.000    a place that is forward-looking        143    00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.160    yet slow moving        144    00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.199    a school that pre-dates america        145    00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:15.199    is intensely american        146    00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:19.199    and international at the same time        147    00:17:19.199 --> 00:17:21.600    and like the history of our university        148    00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.720    reverend gomes himself was a man of        149    00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.799    contradictions        150    00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:28.319    he was a waspy        151    00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.000    african-american        152    00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.679    baptized catholic turned baptist        153    00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:33.120    preacher        154    00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.200    a friend of ronald reagan and a role        155    00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.360    model for the gay community        156    00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.679    and he fit in at harvard        157    00:17:39.679 --> 00:17:42.559    as well as anyone        158    00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.080    in a 2008 interview about his background        159    00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.679    he said        160    00:17:47.679 --> 00:17:49.840    it is what it is        161    00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.320    i am what i am        162    00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.600    it confuses people        163    00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.520    which gives me great pleasure        164    00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.640    and perhaps that's the true value of our        165    00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.440    university as we all move forward into        166    00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.679    an uncertain future        167    00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:10.320    each of us myself included        168    00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.400    can find contradictions in our own        169    00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.559    backgrounds interests        170    00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:16.480    and aspirations        171    00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.880    sometimes making us feel isolated from        172    00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.320    what we suppose        173    00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.679    a harvard student ought to be        174    00:18:23.679 --> 00:18:26.000    for many of us such contradictions might        175    00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.240    be worthy of hiding        176    00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.120    yet reverend gomes was a man who saw        177    00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.679    strength in them        178    00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:35.600    we must embrace our contradictions and        179    00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.720    not be afraid to talk about them        180

   00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:21.000    one of japan's great haiku masters        201    00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:24.320    when he composed it he was already        202    00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.400    acknowledged to be a dexterous        203    00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.960    manipulator of the japanese tongue and a        204    00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.480    profound observer of the human condition        205    00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.960    he lived in a little hut on the        206    00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.640    outskirts of edo        207    00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.880    a great metropolis of a million people        208    00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.080    that grew to become present-day tokyo        209    00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.720    disciples gathered for miles around to        210    00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.360    live at his side and to see life through        211    00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.760    his eyes        212    00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.760    but fame weighed heavily on his        213    00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.960    shoulders        214    00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.480    he longed to escape        215    00:20:56.559 --> 00:21:00.159    furbasho knew that life is a journey        216    00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:02.080    though the way was long and dangerous he        217    00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.520    desired nothing more than to leave        218    00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.919    behind the cosmopolitan comforts of the        219    00:21:05.919 --> 00:21:08.960    city in order to discover the wilds of        220    00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.039    the north        221    00:21:11.039 --> 00:21:13.039    when he set out on his journey        222    00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:14.960    well-wishers gathered at the outskirts        223    00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.400    of edo        224    00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.159    it was there that he composed this haiku        225    00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:22.080    yuku        226    00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.840    it is the spring of leaving        227    00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.919    torinaki        228    00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:31.640    the birds are crying        229    00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.679    and in the eyes of the fish        230    00:21:35.679 --> 00:21:38.480    there are tears        231    00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.720    what an extraordinary vision all of        232    00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.360    nature hushed and saddened partaking in        233    00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.200    the scene of an old poet        234    00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.200    too old for the road ahead        235    00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.640    leaving his friends behind        236    00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.760    gathered in tercentenary theater with        237    00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.520    trees for columns and branches        238    00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.360    supporting the sky        239    00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.000    i wonder if there aren't birds crying        240    00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.720    here as well        241    00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.760    perhaps the bell of memorial church is        242    00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.240    gazing down upon us wondering which one        243    00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.240    of you to anoint with the task of        244    00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.640    bringing peace to this world which to        245    00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.320    raise up to a presidency of prime        246    00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.120    ministership which to make a lawgiver to        247    00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.120    the nations which a champion of the        248    00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.280    oppressed        249    00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.240    perhaps that bronze statue of john        250    00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.640    harvard is sitting on his plinth        251    00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.760    thinking        252    00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.000    i do not doubt that one among them will        253    00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.559    make dark matter speak another will cure        254    00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:34.480    disease an entrepreneur will change the        255    00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.280    way we live a scientist will translate        256    00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.840    the wildest dreams of fiction        257    00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.400    into reality        258    00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.480    perhaps there's a book        259    00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.559    in widener stacks        260    00:22:46.559 --> 00:22:49.200    whose pages you are the first to turn        261    00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.840    whose words you are the first to read        262    00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.559    that consoles itself when it considers        263    00:22:54.559 --> 00:22:56.159    your departure        264    00:22:56.159 --> 00:22:57.679    with the thought that you will feel        265    00:22:57.679 --> 00:23:00.080    things no one has ever felt        266    00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.240    think things never thought        267    00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.880    and write things often thoughts in new        268    00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.760    and brilliant ways        269    00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.159    perhaps all of them bell bronze and book        270    00:23:10.159 --> 00:23:12.159    are thinking well        271    00:23:12.159 --> 00:23:14.480    if that's their calling        272    00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.360    then let them go        273    00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.960    yet        274    00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.640    there's another meaning encoded in        275    00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.320    basho's haiku hidden in a homonym        276    00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.000    yukuharuya        277    00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.559    spring is passing        278    00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:31.919    torinaki        279    00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:33.840    the birds are crying        280    00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.000    or because naku also means to squawk or        281    00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.080    chirp they're simply doing what birds do        282    00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.200    when they open their beaks        283    00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.840    and the eyes of the fish are wet        284    00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.600    but of course they are they live in        285    00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.679    water        286    00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:51.760    read this way the fish and birds are        287    00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.440    shamelessly ignorant of what is        288    00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.200    happening above and below        289    00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.919    they simply do not now        290    00:23:57.919 --> 00:24:01.360    why am i introduced of occasions        291    00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.679    because bashor knew that the pathetic        292    00:24:03.679 --> 00:24:04.799    fallacy        293    00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:06.720    the inscription of human emotions to the        294    00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.520    world around us while it raises us up to        295    00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.200    abstract heights        296    00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.000    tends to obscure the intimate        297    00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.600    the concrete        298    00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:20.400    the here and now of the people around us        299    00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.200    and so with this second reading in mind        300    00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.640    allow me to offer the following        301    00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:29.440    make time today        302

sorry a few words because this past        9    00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.190    year I had the opportunity to join        10    00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.590    president Faust for events with alumni        11    00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.590    in Mumbai and New Delhi on her inaugural        12    00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.830    visit to India while I fortunately and        13    00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.720    frequently have the occasion to hear        14    00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.239    president Faust speak at home I had        15    00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.580    never heard her speak abroad and was        16    00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.220    privileged to re-experience her        17    00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.879    intelligence warmth and eloquence as if        18    00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.210    for the first time it's easy to forget        19    00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.820    what an extraordinary influence harvard        20    00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.500    and its president have on the world        21    00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.310    until you see it firsthand very far away        22    00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.520    from home her determination to ensure        23    00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.650    that the Harvard library remains the        24    00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.380    preeminent light university library of        25    00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.170    the 21st century and her commitment to        26    00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.020    the Arts a passion I very much share our        27    00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.720    but two of her many accomplishments        28    00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.290    I'd like to single out today now please        29    00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.870    join me in welcoming a president who        30    00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.200    exemplifies the vision values and        31    00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.930    Veritas at the heart of everything        32

we closed our        35    00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.260    year of commemorating Harvard's three        36    00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.680    hundred and seventy fifth birthday from        37    00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.550    an exuberant party for 18,000 people in        38    00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.690    torrential rain and ankle-deep mud here        39    00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.380    in tercentenary theatre last fall to        40    00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.650    today's invocation of John Harvard's        41    00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.490    spirit still walking the yard we have        42    00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.760    celebrated this special year and the        43    00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.730    institution's singular and distinguished        44    00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.330    history founded by an act of the great        45    00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.820    and General Court of the Massachusetts        46    00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.770    Bay Colony in 1636 Harvard was the first        47    00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.280    college in the English colonies and is        48    00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.980    the oldest in what has become the United        49    00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.850    States Harvard was already a hundred and        50    00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.220    forty years old when the nation was        51    00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.180    founded there are a few institutions in        52    00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.450    this country or even the world that can        53    00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.890    claim such longevity but what does such        54    00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.120    a claim mean at a time when the buzzword        55    00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.320    of innovation is everywhere when the        56    00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.130    allure of the new drives business        57    00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.910    politics and society what do we intend        58    00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.230    by our celebration of endurance and of        59    00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.370    history why do we see history as an        60    00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.600    essential part of our identity        61    00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.570    why is Harvard's past an invaluable        62    00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.320    resource as we decide how to shape the        63    00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.269    future in a quite literal sense history        64    00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.440    creates our identity who we as Harvard        65    00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.100    actually are and as a result who we        66    00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.989    aspire to be we live in a community made        67    00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.840    up not just of the students faculty        68    00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.840    staff        69    00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.459    now here or even the 300,000 Harvard        70    00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.050    alumni around the world we are part of a        71    00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.319    community that extends across time as        72    00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.950    well as space we acknowledge an        73    00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.130    indelible connection to those who have        74    00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.600    come before predecessors both recent and        75    00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.570    remote who remind us of what is possible        76    00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.229    for us by their demonstration of what        77    00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.100    was possible for them        78    00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.550    Harvard's history instills both        79    00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.940    expectations and responsibilities as it        80    00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.979    challenges us to inhabit this legacy one        81    00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.830    cannot study philosophy here without        82    00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.430    citing the ghosts of John Rawls Willard        83    00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.590    Quine Benjamin purse Ralph Waldo Emerson        84    00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.350    William James one cannot study law        85    00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.380    without thinking of the 18 Harvard Law        86    00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.500    School alumni who have served as Supreme        87    00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.760    Court justices including the six        88    00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.520    currently on the bench not to mention        89    00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.610    the Graduate in the White House and the        90    00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.710    seven presidents with Harvard degrees        91    00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.850    who have preceded him those who appear        92    00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.030    on Harvard stages surely imagine        93    00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.120    themselves as Jack Lemmon or Natalie        94    00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.350    Portman or Stockard Channing directed by        95    00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.639    the equivalents of Peter Sellers or        96    00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.900    Diane Paulus or Mira Nair or perhaps our        97    00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.539    aspiring actors see themselves in John        98    00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.870    Lithgow and Tommy Lee Jones who returned        99    00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.210    together for arts first weekend last        100    00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.450    month to reminisce about their thespian        101    00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.750    adventures in Cambridge and those        102    00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.370    seeking to change the world through        103    00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.030    technology are sure to reflect on        104    00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.510    Zuckerberg Ballmer and gates in those        105    00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.130    domains and so many others        106    00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.980    we have the privilege of living        107    00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.840    alongside a remarkable heritage of        108    00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.570    predecessors we've certainly not come to        109    00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.720    work and study in Cambridge and Boston        110    00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.750    because of the weather though this past        111    00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.120    winners suggest climate change may be        112    00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.380    altering that we are drawn here because        113    00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.520    others before us have set a standard        114    00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.550    that extends across centuries in its        115    00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.970    power and its appeal we think of        116    00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.360    ourselves in their company we seek to be        117    00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.600    worthy of that company and to share our        118    00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.390    days with others similarly motivated and        119    00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.500    inspired we want to contribute as they        120    00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.230    have contributed in every imaginable        121    00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.750    field we want to know to understand        122    00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.900    society's government's IRA's        123    00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.090    organisations galaxies works of art and        124    00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.510    literature structures circuits diseases        125    00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.700    cells we want to make our lives matter        126    00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.260    we want to improve the human condition        127    00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.550    and build a better world we want Harvard        128    00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.450    to ask that of us to expect that of us        129    00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:35.090    and to equip us to accomplish it history        130    00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.080    shapes our institutional ideals as well        131    00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.220    as our individual ambitions having a        132    00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.950    history diminishes the grip of the        133    00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.850    myopic present helping us to see beyond        134    00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.780    its bounds to transcend the immediate in        135    00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.490    search of the enduring it challenges us        136    00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.960    to place our aspirations and        137    00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.790    responsibilities within the broadest        138    00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:09.590    context of understanding we expect the        139    00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:14.390    future to be as long as the past we must        140    00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.940    act in ways that are not just about        141    00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.210    tomorrow but about decades        142    00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:24.590    and even centuries to come this means        143    00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.470    that we teach our students with the        144    00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.380    intention of shaping the whole of their        145    00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.890    lives as well as readying them for what        146    00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.550    happens as soon as they leave our gates        147    00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.950    this means that in the sciences and        148    00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.490    beyond we support research that is        149    00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.089    driven by curiosity by the sheer desire        150    00:08:47.089 --> 00:08:50.540    to understand at the same time that we        151    00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.440    pursue discoveries that have immediate        152    00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.380    measurable impact and it means that we        153    00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.440    support fields of study of languages        154    00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.709    literature's cultures that are intended        155    00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:06.980    to locate us within traditions of        156    00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.339    reflection about the larger purposes of        157    00:09:10.339 --> 00:09:14.089    human existence enabling us to look        158    00:09:14.089 --> 00:09:17.270    beyond ourselves and our own experience        159    00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:22.040    to ask where we are going not just how        160    00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.579    we get there even in our professional        161    00:09:25.579 --> 00:09:28.390    schools designed to educate students for        162    00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:32.420    specific vocations we seek to instill        163    00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.300    the perspective that derives from the        164    00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.260    critical eye and the questioning mind we        165    00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.910    charge our students to think about        166    00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:46.120    lasting value not just quarterly returns        167    00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.240    these commitments shape our        168    00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:53.089    institutional identity our discussions        169    00:09:53.089 --> 00:09:56.750    and decisions about what a university is        170    00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:01.520    and must be as both higher education and        171    00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.850    the world have been transformed Harvard        172    00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:08.720    has not just weathered the past 375        173    00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.730    years it has changed and flourished from        174    00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.270    its origins as a small local college        175    00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.480    designed to produce educated ministers        176    00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.230    and citizens to its emergence as a        177    00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.140    research university in the late 19th        178    00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:27.860    century        179    00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.370    - its transformation into a national        180    00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:34.470    institution and its development after        181    00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.820    World War two as an engine of scientific        182    00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:42.000    discovery and economic growth as well as        183    00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.120    a force for significantly broadening        184    00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.830    social opportunity we are now in another        185    00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.650    moment of dramatic shift in higher        186    00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:57.000    education globalization and technology        187    00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.030    are prominent among the forces that        188    00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.210    challenge us once again to examine how        189    00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.940    we do our work and how we define our        190    00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:10.200    aims this year alone we have launched a        191    00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.080    new university-wide initiative to think        192    00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.450    in fresh ways about our methods of        193    00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.900    learning and teaching a new        194    00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.790    university-wide innovation lab to help        195    00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.680    our students bring their ideas to life        196    00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:27.330    and EDX a new partnership with MIT to        197    00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.510    embrace the promise of online learning        198    00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.480    for our students while sharing our        199    00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.470    knowledge more widely with the world as        200    00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.840    we reimagine ourselves for the 21st        201    00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.810    century we recognize that history        202    00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.600    teaches us not just about continuity        203    00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.800    what is important because it's enduring        204    00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.970    history also teaches us about change        205    00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:56.880    Harvard has survived and thrived by        206    00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.070    considering over and over again how it's        207    00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.530    timeless and unwavering dedication to        208    00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.100    knowledge and truth must be adapted to        209    00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:12.360    the demands of each new age history        210    00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.340    encourages us to see contingency and        211    00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.460    opportunity by offering us the ability        212    00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.510    to imagine a different world        213    00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.970    think of how Harvard changed as we came        214    00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.060    to recognize that our commitment to        215    00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.450    fulfilling human potential required us        216    00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.800    to open our gates more broadly        217    00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.269    the continuity of our deepest values led        218    00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:44.569    to the transformation of our practices        219    00:12:44.569 --> 00:12:47.179    and at the characteristics of the        220    00:12:47.179 --> 00:12:50.179    students faculty and staff who inhabit        221    00:12:50.179 --> 00:12:53.629    and embody Harvard what was once        222    00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:57.230    unimaginable came to seem necessary and        223    00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.709    even inevitable as we extended the        224    00:13:00.709 --> 00:13:03.649    circle of inclusion and belonging to        225    00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:06.410

limited        228    00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.709    financial means our history provides a        229    00:13:15.709 --> 00:13:19.009    compass to steer by to borrow a phrase        230

zealous ambition to be a        4    00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.480    great public speaker as part of that        5    00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.800    quest to be a great public speaker he        6    00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.000    joined a club called Toast Masters which        7    00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.080    allows adults to join each other at        8    00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.119    weekly meetings in order to improve        9    00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.679    their public speaking        10    00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.520    skills as a child I sometimes        11    00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.440    accompanied my father to local        12    00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.320    Toastmaster meetings where the first        13    00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.360    order

   00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.520    literally pick up a cheerleaders pom pom        17    00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.199    from a table and with increasingly        18    00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.680    deafening and seemingly misguided        19    00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.440    declamation they would yell enthusiasm        20    00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.480    enthusiasm is my best friend

shouting at the top of their        26    00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.520    lungs it might seem overwhelming but        27    00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.720    that day I stood up on that table picked        28    00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.360    up my pom pom and gave it right back to        29    00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.759    them 12 years later        30    00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.360    I stand before        31    00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.600    you a much more jaded human being than I        32    00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.399    was on that table at        33    00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.920    Toastmasters I've had my accomplishments        34    00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.680    here but I have also felt self-        35    00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.600    disappointment and the many types of        36    00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.840    experiences that Harvard has to offer        37    00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.399    classes internships jobs student groups        38    00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:52.960    and even social        39    00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.320    relationships but wait I'm not the only        40    00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.360    one whether you parents out there are        41    00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.759    willing to admit it many of your sons        42    00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.520    and daughters here today have had        43    00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.840    similar failures in college don't worry        44    00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.360    we feel bad about it        45    00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.920    too in fact some of us know the feeling        46    00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.200    of failure all too well that sensation        47    00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.440    of our heart plunging from our chest        48    00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.720    into the pit of our knotted stomach a        49    00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.640    visceral Visage of        50    00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.920    failure and the word failure that word        51    00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.280    is such a bummer to hear it even has a        52    00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.080    depressing Cadence almost patronizing        53    00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.920    failure it even implies that all fails        54    00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.040    are yours fail        55    00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.239    your the thing about Harvard is that we        56    00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.480    see success and        57    00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.200    accomplishment and it spans the corner        58    00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.120    every single corner of this beatific        59    00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.800    ancient institution we see animated        60    00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.480

Goldman or McKenzie and excited        66    00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.319    dinner discussions of getting into        67    00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.840    Harvard graduate        68    00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.159    schools but we don't hear about failure        69    00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:15.879    it        70    00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.840    exists and the hush silences in our        71    00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.519    dining halls and the fake weary Smiles        72    00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.120    at Social Gatherings and the sulking and        73    00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.920    the carols at Lamont behind the alacrity        74    00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.519    of our answers in section and and most        75    00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.920    prominent about rejection and failure is        76    00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.000    that for many of us Harvard is the first        77    00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.239    place we experience        78    00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.680    it it is a jarring Sensation that can        79    00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.879    erode 18 years of ambition and        80    00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.840    confidence the same enthusiasm with        81    00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.079    which we stepped onto the        82    00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.159    yard that numbing loss of confidence        83    00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.560    gives way to a        84    00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.200    pause and then the inevitable fearful        85    00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.920    conclusion that we are the singular        86    00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.159    admission mistake you see we perceive        87    00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.000    our life at Harvard as a universe in a        88    00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.159    sandbox some can only see the fear of        89    00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.239    failure in a handful of dust but I say        90    00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.799    it is equally easy to find confidence in        91    00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.600    that same handful of dust because even        92    00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.080    right now on the most glorious and H of        93    00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.160    days when we leave an institution that        94    00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.720    is famous worldwide for grooming

   100    00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:43.759    lined up after        101    00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:47.440    graduation some of us are still reeling        102    00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.759    from recent failures social rejections        103    00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.440    bad grades insecurities and hey even        104    00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.720    senior spring so why don't we let        105    00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.759    pessimism persuasive posturing pour into        106    00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.840    your ears as you recall these painful        107    00:05:04.840

may make you doubt your        110    00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.960    resolve may make you doubt your capacity        111    00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.160    and may attempt to trip you as you        112    00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.720    finally take a momentous step outside of        113    00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.759    Harvard and on to the next chapter of        114    00:05:19.759 -->

  00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.199    that has taught us literal lessons and        118    00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.880    some figurative morals I entreat you to        119    00:05:33.880 -->

       122    00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.199    formula was on to something we need        123    00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.120    enthusiasm in the face of fear even if        124    00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.680    we don't count it as our best        125    00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.800    friend        126    00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.840    enthusiasm for the fear of venturing        127    00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.560    into a new city with no friends in a        128    00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.440    career you didn't necessarily expect        129    00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.600    this distant once again from your        130    00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.000    parents here        131    00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.440    today TS Elliot says even if not Hur at        132    00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.520    all you are the music while music lasts        133    00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.199    I say play loudly because being        134    00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.240    overstated is definitely underrated be        135    00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.639    the music that drowns out the atonal        136    00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.280    buzz of your own internal        137    00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.840    uncertainty eminent innovator Steve Jobs        138    00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.120    once said the single greatest Revelation        139    00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.400    in his life was that he will        140    00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.960    die we will die so why spend this moment        141    00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.160    or the next letting the personal punches        142    00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.599    that Harvard has Meed out challenge Us        143    00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:44.919    in the next chapter of Our        144    00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.360    Lives the great modern poet Drake        145    00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.520    supplements his philosophy he says you        146    00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.160    only live once that's the motto        147    00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.400    YOLO the Aged among you may recognize        148    00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.280    this as carpan        149    00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.560    so while the 18 years of momentum we        150    00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.759    have built before Harvard may seem all        151    00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.360    for not the lesson is        152    00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.080    learned that we must persevere harder        153    00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.199    against the outrageous fortunes born by        154    00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:17.720    the slings and arrows of        155    00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.360    maturity what you do next with your life        156    00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.800    will not follow a fixed path that we        157    00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.479    have followed up until now the best        158    00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:26.919    world we meet next imposes        159    00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:30.000    ambiguity there are no set core or gened        160    00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.240    classes to choose from there is no        161    00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.479    consistent Huds menu to rely on and the        162    00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:37.599    commute may even be farther than the        163    00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:40.120    plane ride between the river and the        164    00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.599    quad and this can offer a lot of pain        165    00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:45.159    and confusion but I say the best gain        166    00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:49.120    made from pain is the rain of enthusiasm        167    00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.240    enthusiasm from the fact that we go to        168    00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.360    Harvard you have worked hard to get here        169    00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.159    and will'll in fact work even harder to        170    00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:58.319    raise ourselves to the next Echelon of        171    00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:01.440    crazy awesomeness        172    00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:05.879    it is not the fear of failure we seek in        173    00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:09.400    the sandbox of reality but confidence we        174    00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.800    find in a handful of dust Ravens        175    00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.560    linebacker Ray Lewis once said winds and        176    00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.599    losses come a dime a dozen but effort        177    00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:21.280    nobody can judge effort because effort        178    00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.159    is between you and you so let's take our        179    00:08:25.159 --> 00:08:27.159    Harvard wins and losses use them for        180    00:08:27.159 --> 00:08:28.599    tomorrow and the day after and the day        181    00:08:28.599 --> 00:08:30.639    after that and for the rest of Our Lives        182    00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:33.719    class of 2012 I intreat you and implore        183    00:08:33.719 --> 00:08:35.839    you and ask you to realize that with        184    00:08:35.839 --> 00:08:39.120    your next step in this lifelong Marathon        185    00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.080    you ought to exclaim enthusiasm        186    00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.959    enthusiasm is my best friend enthusiasm        187    00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:49.760    enthusiasm is my best friend enthusiasm        188    00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.959    enthusiasm is my best friend thank you        189    00:08:52.959 -->

19    00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.799    desired nothing more than to leave        20    00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.200    behind the Cosmopolitan Comforts of the        21    00:01:10.200 -->

too old for        35    00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.479    the road ahead leaving his friends        36    00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.119    behind gathered inter tercentenary        37    00:01:57.119

Birds crying here as        40    00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.759    well perhaps the bell of Memorial Church        41    00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.280    is gazing down upon us wondering which        42    00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.440    one of you to anoint with the task of        43    00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.879    bringing peace to this world which to        44    00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.680    raise up to a presidency or prime        45    00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.400    ministership which to make a lawgiver to        46    00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.560    the Nations which a champion of the        47    00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.160    oppressed perhaps that bronze statue of        48    00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.120    John Harvard is sitting on his plinth        49    00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.920    thinking I do not doubt that one among        50    00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.280    them will make dark matter speak another        51    00:02:36.280 -->

wildest dreams of fiction        54    00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.720    into        55    00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.959    reality perhaps there's a book in        56    00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.080    Widener Stacks whose Pages you are the        57    00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.640    first to turn whose words you are the        58    00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.080    first to read that consoles itself when        59    00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.480    it considers your departure        60    00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.959    with the thought that you will feel        61    00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.000    things no one has ever felt think things        62    00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.879    never thought and write things often        63    00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.879    thought in new and Brilliant        64    00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.840    ways and perhaps all of them Bell bronze        65    00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.879    and book are thinking well if that's        66    00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:17.720    their        67    00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.400    calling then let them        68    00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.720    go yet there's another meaning encoded        69    00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.599    in basho's Haiku hidden in a homonym        70    00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.840    yuku haruya spring is        71    00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.400    passing toraki the birds are crying or        72    00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.239    because naku also means to squawk or        73    00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.400    chirp they're simply doing what birds do        74    00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.040    when they open their        75    00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.159    beaks and the eyes of the fish are        76    00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.959    wet but of course they are they live in        77    00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.799    water read this way the fish and birds        78    00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.720    are shamelessly ignorant of what is        79    00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.599    happening above and below they simply do        80    00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.640    not        81    00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.480    care now why am I introducing such an        82    00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.799    infelicitous idea on this most apicius        83    00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.079    of        84    00:04:11.079 -->

   00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.530    I had been at Harvard for a year when I        2    00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.980    decided to emulate my peers by adding a        3    00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.470    respectable quote to the end of my        4    00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.410    emails I eventually settled on one from        5    00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.019    Lewis Carroll's classic through the        6    00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.630    looking-glass from the scene in which        7    00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.360    Alice meets the Red Queen who is running        8    00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.670    around in circles when Alice asked her        9    00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.820    why she's running around in circles the        10    00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.360    Red Queen responds now here you see it        11    00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.610    takes all the running you can do to keep        12    00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.580    in the same place if you want to get        13    00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.790    somewhere else you must run at least        14    00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:59.540    twice as fast as that I thought at the        15    00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.450    very least this quote would show my        16    00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.119    recipients that I had read an acclaimed        17    00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.119    book but I also chose it because it has        18    00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.350    personal significance when I read about        19    00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.590    Alice as a child I knew we were very        20    00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.290    different she's English        21    00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.260    I'm Rondon Kenyan Uganda and Tanzanian        22    00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.840    she's a European with long blonde hair        23    00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.180    I'm an African with a short black afro        24    00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.190    she spends her afternoons reading books        25    00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.340    on a riverbank and playing games of        26    00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.850    croquet by herself        27    00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.530    never mind that she plays them by        28    00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.710    herself I thought what on earth is        29    00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.920    croquet I spent my afternoons doing        30    00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.530    back-breaking housework and feeding the        31    00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.549    chickens you almost believe that don't        32    00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.790    you        33    00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.620    I was actually quite the irresponsible        34    00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.500    African daughter spending most        35    00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.349    afternoons reading books and pretending        36    00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.700    to be a boy so what do Alice's        37    00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.250    Wonderland experiences have to do with        38    00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.459    my time at Harvard for starters I think        39    00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.010    you will all agree that freshman year        40    00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.409    felt a bit like falling down a rabbit        41    00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.030    hole I tumbled through those first        42    00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.629    months trying to reconcile my own false        43    00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.900    starts with my expectations of a Harvard        44    00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.280    student although things did not slow        45    00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.310    down in later years I developed a        46    00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.579    strategy I simply had to run twice as        47    00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.670    fast as my fastest speed which for        48    00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.099    better or worse is much slower than that        49    00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.690    almost Harvard students but the        50    00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.609    questions raised during my Harvard        51    00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.579    career are even more important than the        52    00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.019    pace of life everywhere there seem to be        53    00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.709    a hookah smoking caterpillar asking who        54    00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:28.090    are you I often had no good answers to        55    00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.419    this question        56    00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:34.090    along with my changing accent my views        57    00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.819    on personal and societal issues were in        58    00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.560    a constant state of flux in the US        59    00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.599    Census should I call myself black /        60    00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.849    african-american or should I check the        61    00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.829    other box should I share the Kony 2012        62    00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.340    video or instead point out the many        63    00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.739    other pertinent issues on the African        64    00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.019    continent and indeed the rest of the        65    00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.940    world should i watch the Red Sox game        66    00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.510    with my friends or finally confess my        67    00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.810    disinterest in any American sport not        68    00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.090    associated with Harvard Yale Weekend or        69    00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.079    Jeremy Lin        70    00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.160    my identity hinged on these questions        71    00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.430    and since I couldn't always answer them        72    00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.160    decisively it seemed I could not        73    00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:37.360    identify myself I needed to strike a        74    00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.120    balance between extreme confidence in my        75    00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.210    abilities and being intimidated by        76    00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.680    impressive peers when I heard of other        77    00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.010    people's accomplishments my ego often        78    00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.510    shrank so fast        79    00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.240    it felt like I had drank from an from a        80    00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.190    small Wonderland bottle suspiciously        81    00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.990    marked drink me I also had to keep my        82    00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.740    ego from swelling beyond recognition if        83    00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.470    you think dropping the h-bomb here is        84    00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.160    challenging try East Africa where Yale        85    00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.280    truly is an afterthought thankfully it        86    00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.620    often suffice to say I go to school in        87    00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.080    America you go to school in America Wow        88    00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.289    how's Obama        89    00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:37.349    I want to come can you help me it seemed        90    00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:39.599    like my head could never find its ideal        91    00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.680    size if ever there was one        92    00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.819    as my adventures in Harvard land come to        93    00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:51.210    a close I have to confront Colleen from        94    00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.919    2008 she is echoing the caterpillars        95    00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:59.300    incessant question Who am I        96    00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:06.360    how his Harvard shakes me despite all        97    00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.990    the uncertainty I have experienced I        98    00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.819    look back on my Harvard career with a        99    00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:17.159    Cheshire smile you see unlike Alice        100    00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:22.589    I did not journey alone from the frantic        101    00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:24.959    rush of freshman year to the        102    00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:29.610    slothfulness of senior year my family        103    00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.879    friends and advisers always walked with        104    00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:37.199    me my friends convinced me that I was        105    00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.199    not completely batty and when that did        106    00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.009    not work        107    00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.199    that being batty really isn't that bad        108    00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:51.149    my advisers tutors bosses and TFS gave        109    00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:54.089    me reality checks and after hearing        110    00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:56.759    about my Wonderland obsession they'll        111    00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:01.349    realize they acted just in time and of        112    00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:05.490    course there's always family to be fair        113    00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.009    I did have two families        114    00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.800    if you can get past the identity crisis        115    00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.030    that comes with being an international        116    00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.360    student you will discover the joys of        117    00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.930    having a loving American host family in        118    00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.750    addition to the Rwandan one that took        119    00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.250    all your nonsense growing up        120    00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.710    as I traveled I learned that Harvard is        121    00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.169    not the Wonderland where things always        122    00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:57.740    work like magic it is the Wonderland        123    00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.560    where we tirelessly question the beliefs        124    00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.120    and assumptions that used to define us a        125    00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.789    place where we try to make sense of a        126    00:08:07.789 --> 00:08:12.460    world that often seems quite absurd        127    00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.039    knowing that hard work not magic will        128    00:08:16.039 --> 00:08:20.510    solve its problems in the process we all        129    00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.330    learned one or two things about who we        130    00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.440    are these are the most valuable lessons        131    00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.169    we will apply to our lives and to the        132    00:08:30.169 --> 00:08:35.510    people we hope to touch finally if all        133    00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.789    the good nature donations today do not        134    00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:40.969    inspire you to greater heights I urge        135    00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:43.450    you to follow the white Queens advice        136    00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.370    start believing at least six impossible        137    00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.300    things before breakfast if you are        138    00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.510    anything like me at least six of those        139    00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.330    things will be events that allows you to        140    00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.240    be here today a Harvard graduate        141    00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.560    against all odds dream on Harvard class        142    00:09:03.560 -->

       6    00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.400    Harvard possessed was a 300 volume        7    00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.519    collection of books and in a State worth        8    00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.079    at least        9    00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.160    780 which is the amount he donated to a        10    00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.000    newly established Massachusetts College        11    00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.239    upon his death in        12    00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.239    1638 that's it        13    00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.879    780b that's just pocket change to those        14    00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.440    of you who have absurdly overpaid jobs        15    00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.680    like corporate consultant or Dean of the        16    00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.760    office of student        17    00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.519    life        18    00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.439    but alas our University is named for the        19    00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.880    English Minister John Harvard simply        20    00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.960    because he donated his books and        21    00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.560    780b so what would John Harvard say if        22    00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.960    he could come back to life today just to        23    00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.360    see what his dying contribution has done        24    00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.520    for his        25    00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.520    name Cy he might say if he were        26    00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.759    Australian which he was        27    00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.840    not but seriously imagine how it would        28    00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.799    feel to learn that over nearly four        29    00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.960    centuries your own name had become        30    00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.560    synonymous with scholarly Brilliance        31    00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.000    Elite exclusivity and what Webster's        32    00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.840    Dictionary defines as not getting        33    00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.240    any to find out that you had become a        34    00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.719    global brand name like Johnson and        35    00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.320    Johnson or Blue Ivy        36    00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.439    Carter how would one react to all this I        37    00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.960    am sure that John Harvard would be        38    00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.159    honored to see his name printed on the        39    00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.880    resumes and sweatshirts of the world's        40    00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.560    most promising        41    00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.560    Geniuses after all we are all        42    00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.879    Geniuses each and every one of us was        43    00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.640    valedictorian of our high school class        44    00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.239    we all have an IQ of 300        45    00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.959    billion we've all achieved local glory        46    00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.879    in our hometown newspapers right well        47    00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.280    getting accepted to Harvard certainly        48    00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.959    landed me on the front page of my        49    00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.760    hometown paper the New York Times        50    00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.879    John Harvard would also be excited that        51    00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.680    the yard named for him has become an        52    00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.640    international tourist        53    00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.800    destination why wouldn't he be excited        54    00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.640    about that what's not to love about all        55    00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.519    those        56    00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.720    tourists take it from somebody who lived        57    00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.280    on the first floor of stoen you don't        58    00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.319    even need to set an alarm clock when you        59    00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.760    can be awoken every day by a Korean        60    00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.760    family taking photos of you sleeping        61    00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.799    but what would John Harvard say about        62    00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.879    the more controversial issues on campus        63    00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.319    would he be embarrassed to see how the        64    00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.280    school name for him was portrayed in        65    00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.480    films like the social network and        66    00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.640    speaking of the social network how        67    00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.959    confused John Harvard might be to learn        68    00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.239    that his name is associated with the        69    00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.640    world's most popular stalking        70    00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.760    platform I can just hear him asking        71    00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.959    asking what exactly is Facebook how do I        72    00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.120    untag all these        73    00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.599    photos and who is this Luis Martinez        74    00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.760    that keeps writing on my        75    00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.599    wall yet        76    00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.239    ultimately I think that John Harvard        77    00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.319    would mainly feel a humble sense of        78    00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.640    Pride to be here today looking at the        79    00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.879    promising young adults whose education        80    00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.439    he endowed from from a        81    00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.720    distance after all John Harvard donated        82    00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.799    to this school so he could contribute to        83    00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.319    others not to boast his own        84    00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.239    achievements in fact he didn't have many        85    00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.000    achievements to boast by the time he        86    00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.680    left his historic donation John Harvard        87    00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.600    was only 30 years old how crazy is that        88    00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.160    the only thing I can hope to donate by        89    00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.040    the time I turn 30 is        90    00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.199    sperm that's not even a joke it's        91    00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.960    currently my only prospect for paying        92    00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.639    rent next        93    00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.360    year but you know at least I'm following        94    00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.160    my dreams        95    00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.320    right I want us to consider though how        96    00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.680    ironic it is that Harvard is named for        97    00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.800    somebody who contributed more than he        98    00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.160    achieved we are a student body that        99    00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.360    seems singularly focused on achieving        100    00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.960    things for ourselves and we frequent use        101    00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.120    Harvard's name as a benchmark for those        102    00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.160    personal        103    00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.960    achievements and yet we Harvard students        104    00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.320    so rarely make any effort to contribute        105    00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.199    to others not even to purchase a paper        106

should not and must not        112    00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:35.600    achieve without        113    00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.039    contributing we already have follow John        114    00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.160    Harvard's example through contributions        115    00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.199    we've made to our campus our peers and        116    00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.720    our friends and we will continue to        117    00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.800    follow his example with contributions        118    00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.080    we'll make long after tomorrow when we        119    00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.520    commence our freshman year in the real        120    00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.160    world our contributions don't have to be        121    00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.000    monetary like John Harvard's was these        122    00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.680    contributions might rather surface        123    00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.360    through scientific breakthroughs        124    00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.599    artistic Creations humanitarian Acts or        125    00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:08.960    hilariously high-profile incidents of        126    00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.520    plagiarism and identity        127    00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.280    fraud So within the class of        128    00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.080    2012 whose name will still be remembered        129    00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.199    in 375 years from now when 10e        130    00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:24.919    professors have been replaced by robots        131    00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:26.479    and the shuttle does not take you to the        132    00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:30.039    quad but rather to the Moon        133    00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:31.720    where Harvard will need to build new        134    00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.639    dorms because Construction in Austin        135    00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:36.199    will still be        136    00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.160    incomplete I hope that we will continue        137    00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.639    to not only remember those who achieved        138    00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:44.800    but those who        139    00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.360    contributed so fellow classmates when        140    00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.440    you take your final steps around this        141    00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.280    great yard please take a moment to stop        142    00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.160    at the John Harvard statue and before        143    00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.280    you unzip your pants to pee on that        144    00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.160    thing one last time        145    00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.120    say thank you John Harvard thank you        146    00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.639    congratulations to the families and        147    00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:09.639    graduates of the

00:00:12.660    makers and his quick wit and last        4    00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.280    analogies have made him one of the most        5    00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.619    entertaining during a town hall meeting        6    00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.260    in 2009 he responded to an angry critic        7    00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.080    from The Audience by her saying trying        8    00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.939    to have a conversation with you would be        9    00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.199    like trying to argue with a dining room        10    00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.560    table I have no interest in doing it        11    00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.420    so without further Ado we have the great        12    00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.579    pleasure of introducing our alumni guest        13    00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.660    speaker Mr Barney Frank        14    00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.520    thank you        15    00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.860    I        16    00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.100    I have one diminishing hope        17    00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.420    as I        18    00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.579    looked to my retirement and I appreciate        19    00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.960    the kind words that these guys said but        20    00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.539    at least once before I retire I would        21    00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.320    like to be introduced with further ado        22    00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.799    I have a burning desire to see what it        23    00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.320    looks like it involves in my mind a man        24    00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.479    on a unicycle and a trombone and maybe        25    00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.119    some other Factor        26    00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.880    I'm very flattered to have been invited        27    00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.760    back to a place where I have spent        28    00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.880    so many years and and learned so much        29    00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.220    I am reminded of traditions as I look        30    00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.840    out at Weidner Library        31    00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.880    and I'm reminded that things need to        32    00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.780    change as well as to be preserved I        33    00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.180    appreciated the kind remarks about the        34    00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.340    financial Reform Bill but I do believe        35    00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.140    there should be balance and while it is        36    00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.119    true a number of people thought highly        37    00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.000    of the financial Reform Bill the CEO of        38    00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.920    JP Morgan Chase thought it went too far        39    00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.079    I thought I would just give both sides        40    00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.680    of the argument        41    00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.579    I am reminded of that need to evolve by        42    00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.259    widening library because        43    00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.180    when I was here there was still a        44    00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.479    requirement that students had to swim I        45    00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.060    think it was 50 yards before they could        46    00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.680    graduate and I remember asking Nathan        47    00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.220    fusey in my senior year what the        48    00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.720    connection was and why Harvard        49    00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.620    maintained a requirement that you would        50    00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.080    have to swim and he said apparently        51    00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.900    accurately that it was because Harry        52    00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.620    Elkins Widener had drowned with the        53    00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.020    sinking of the Titanic        54    00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.420    and it made me very grateful at the time        55    00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.160    that he had not gone down in a plane        56    00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.459    crash        57    00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.120    I do want to live up to my obligation to        58    00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.760    give some advice I do realize also by        59    00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.500    the way I'm here the students are        60    00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.060    speaking and it's their day and they        61    00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.379    should be speaking and there'll be other        62    00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.640    important things        63    00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.700    most of you were here justifiably proud        64    00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.959    of the        65    00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.660    family member who's graduating and all        66    00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.620    you did        67    00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.900    and I understand my role as a speaker        68    00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.420    here particularly alumni speaker it's        69    00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.700    like singing The Star-Spangled Banner at        70    00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.500    the World Series        71    00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.700    nobody came to hear you        72    00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.800    but it's not an official event unless        73    00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.800    you do it        74    00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.720    and the only time anybody will remember        75    00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.720    you is if you screw it up real bad        76    00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.879    so I hope not to be too memorable on        77    00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.379    this occasion we have other things to        78    00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.840    think about but I will give you some        79    00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.720    some some advice        80    00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.360    joining on my years some of it is        81    00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.060    practical you will if you get into some        82    00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.760    line of work like mine from time to time        83    00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.060    be invited to places where people want        84    00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.340    to pay you tribute and hope that they        85    00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.440    lock you in on a couple things I'm        86    00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.500    looking for and they will try to seal        87    00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.560    that deal by giving you something        88    00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.920    a mug a t-shirt        89    00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.799    a plaque I have one very important piece        90    00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.319    of advice based on experience never        91    00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.239    throw anything out within one mile of        92    00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.400    where it was presented to you        93    00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.080    you will find that very useful        94    00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.980    secondly        95    00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.860    my niece Madeline is here who is a        96    00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.320    junior uh        97    00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.079    she is doing me the great favor she has        98    00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.600    with me the kind of schleppy green        99    00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.180    carry-all I have because one of the        100    00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.280    things I've learned is never give        101    00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.259    anybody else custody of something you're        102    00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:30.720    going to need if you want to leave early        103    00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.900    Madeline I thank you        104    00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.900    I will also give you some advice about        105    00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.479    how if you are in elected office        106    00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.759    to stay out of trouble now one way to        107    00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.139    stay out of trouble is of course to be        108    00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:43.979    perfect        109    00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.620    for those of us who will find that hard        110    00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.259    here are a couple of rules one and I        111    00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.419    know this goes counter to the culture of        112    00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:52.919    the young people today with all the        113    00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.900    electronics        114    00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.300    I learned this in City Hall in Boston in        115    00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.919    1967.        116    00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.840    and if you read the stories of        117    00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.340    indictments of people who have done        118    00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.979    insider trading or other things you        119    00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.740    understand its impact never right when        120    00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.840    you can talk never talk when you can nod        121    00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.000    and never nod when you can wink        122    00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.580    advise you that        123    00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.080    you know I don't know how you make your        124    00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.880    blackberry Wing but if I were you I'd        125    00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.660    learn how to do it        126    00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.880    I would also say well obviously        127    00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.500    especially if you're in public office        128    00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.080    you should be very law-abiding if that        129    00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.380    isn't possible there is a practical rule        130    00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.600    that is very very important        131    00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.500    be sure that you obey every law that you        132    00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.160    have voted for        133    00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.680    that you're probably doing pretty good        134    00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.340    I left myself some wiggle room        135    00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.500    then there is a question of how do you        136    00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.220    approach public policy I will cite one        137    00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.259    of the great philosophers of the 20th        138    00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:56.940    century whom        139    00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.740    maybe the parents maybe in some cases        140    00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.380    the grandparents will be familiar with        141    00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.440    and he articulated a rule that I have        142    00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.060    found        143    00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.280    it's a metric it's a way to approach        144    00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.039    issues that I have found indispensable        145    00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:13.199    his name was Henny Youngman        146    00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.120    he was a great comedian yeah they        147    00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.000    audiences know him less and less        148    00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.580    and he was part of that comedy tradition        149    00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.699    in the 40s 50s and 60s when men made        150    00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:25.259    jokes about the mothers-in-law and their        151    00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:27.780    wives Etc but he had one which was        152    00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.660    terribly profound and very funny he did        153    00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.880    these kind of quick one-liners how's        154    00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.880    your wife compared to what        155    00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.639    now I'm pleased to be able to say that        156    00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:41.639    within two months I will be able fully        157    00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.080    to make that my own        158    00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.360    and I hope I will be asked how's your        159    00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.919    husband I'll be able to say compared to        160    00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.039    why        161    00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.720    but I recommend to you        162    00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.060    I cannot think of a public policy        163    00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.220    decision I have had to make where I        164    00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.620    don't keep in mind compared to what        165    00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.539    because I don't have the luxury of        166    00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:04.979    creating a new reality and that then        167    00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:07.800    leads me into some semantic guys        168    00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.479    first of all        169    00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:11.160    do not I'm a great believer in free        170    00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.479    speech I haven't got anybody say        171    00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:14.100    anything about anybody including by the        172    00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.800    way and I would just add to that remark        173    00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.600    I made to the woman        174    00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.599    my compared unfavorably to a dining room        175    00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:22.740    table        176    00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.780    um        177    00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.460    she had        178    00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.099    asked me why I was supporting a health        179    00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:30.479    care policy        180    00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:33.419    President Obama which was based on the        181    00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:36.000    Nazi philosophy and I did not consider        182    00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.300    that to be the kind of question that we        183    00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.819    required a civil answer        184    00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:44.160    but I also went on to say that I am a        185    00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.780    great believer the First Amendment and I        186    00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.759    was glad that she had the right to say        187    00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.440    something so contemptible without any        188    00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.979    fear of uh of any penalty so I'm not        189    00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:54.780    prelimiting what anybody says about        190    00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.880    anybody        191    00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.759    I supported strongly a hate crimes bill        192    00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:02.280    which amended the hate crimes law by        193    00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.440    adding sexual orientation gender        194    00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.319    identity to the lists of motives that        195    00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:09.240    could enhance a sentence some of my        196    00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.099    colleagues said well but some of them        197    00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:12.900    ministers had said that would endanger        198    00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.300    their ability to say anti-gay things        199    00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.360    from the pulpit and my answer was no we        200    00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.919    are not trying to criminalize speech we        201    00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:21.240    couldn't if we wanted to we don't want        202    00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.400    to this is only an added sentence        203    00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.840    enhancement for an otherwise criminal        204    00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.120    act and I said let me be very clear I        205    00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.440    was at that time chairman of the        206    00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.539    financial services committee if this        207    00:08:30.539 --> 00:08:33.360    bill passes tomorrow it will still be        208    00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.360    entirely legal to call me a I just        209    00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.620    wouldn't recommend it if you're in the        210    00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.099    banking business        211    00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:45.779    but there are some things I would at        212    00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:47.820    least discourage first of all        213    00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.660    please do not ever use the words        214    00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.279    pragmatic and idealistic as if they were        215    00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:54.600    opposites        216    00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.180    if you are in public life and you are        217    00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.279    doing things that make people follow        218    00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:01.200    your policies        219    00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.360    then you better be idealistic you have        220    00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.279    no justification for that unless you are        221    00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:06.899    trying to make it a better world        222    00:09:06.899 --> 00:09:10.080    but once you have a set of ideals        223    00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.240    you are morally obligated to be        224    00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.620    pragmatic        225    00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.140    what good are a set of ideals that are        226    00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.500    unrealized they make you feel better but        227    00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.660    they don't feed a hungry child or clean        228    00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.540    up a river or do anything to help        229    00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.899    anybody whatsoever so I urge you please        230    00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:30.720    make sure that you are pragmatic in the        231    00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.820    service of your idealism and don't        232    00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.880    consider them opposite secondly never        233    00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.800    use metaphors in the debate on public        234    00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.620    policy particularly in foreign policy        235    00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.440    there are no dominoes countries do not        236    00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.240    fall over and hit each other        237    00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.040    one of the great minds of My Time        238    00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.420    Winston Churchill        239    00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.180    debated whether or not to invade Europe        240    00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.640    through northern France which was        241    00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.920    ultimately successful or to do what he        242    00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.839    wanted to do which was to go through the        243    00:10:00.839 --> 00:10:03.120    Mediterranean attacking what he said was        244    00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.820    the soft underbelly of the axis someone        245    00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.339    finally said to him you know Winston the        246    00:10:08.339 --> 00:10:10.500    southern coast of France is no softer        247    00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.839    than the northern coast of France just        248    00:10:12.839 --> 00:10:15.120    because on a map it may vaguely resemble        249    00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.000    an animal is irrelevant and people        250    00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.339    debate metaphors and take them as        251    00:10:20.339 --> 00:10:22.980    reality metaphors mislead you please try        252    00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.779    to avoid them        253    00:10:24.779 --> 00:10:27.420    one other plea I would make please do        254    00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.060    not use partisan referring to political        255    00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.060    parties as if it was a bad thing        256    00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.760    I was going to be an academic before I        257    00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.100    went to politics you may if you fall        258    00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.800    more closely than anyone ought to the        259    00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.260    introduction wonder whether the        260    00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.779    introducer misspoke or whether the        261    00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:47.459    program did when it said that I        262    00:10:47.459 --> 00:10:49.920    graduated from the college in 61 and the        263    00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.620    law school in 77 16 years is kind of a        264    00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.779    long stretch well the answer is Indiana        265    00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:57.180    where my was going to be an academic and        266    00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.320    I will give you one other piece of        267    00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.019    advice the evaluating seniors        268    00:11:01.019 --> 00:11:03.660    try to find a line of work if you can        269    00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.300    where your personal characteristics or        270    00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.339    strengths and not weaknesses and we all        271    00:11:08.339 --> 00:11:09.720    have characteristics it can be a        272    00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.160    strength in one context and a weakness        273    00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.620    in another I would        274    00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.560    going to be an academic and write a PhD        275    00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.839    thesis that was here enrolled in The        276    00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:20.519    Graduate School of Arts and Sciences the        277    00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:21.380    program        278    00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.760    gracefully notes that I attended the        279    00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.240    gsas with no degree noted that was kind        280    00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.240    of them it's because I didn't get one        281    00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.540    after a while I left the academic world        282    00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.180    not having completed a thesis        283    00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.040    and went into politics        284    00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.380    and I did it because I learned a lot        285    00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.240    about myself and I recognized that I had        286    00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.700    one characteristic that was a drawback        287    00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.220    in an academic but a great advantage in        288    00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.200    a politician I have a very short        289    00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.040    attention span        290    00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:53.880    if I were you I probably would have        291    00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.920    already lost track of what I'm saying        292    00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.860    the notion that you should try to        293    00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.660    overcome your weaknesses and then force        294    00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.100    yourself to do what you're not good at        295    00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.200    has never made a great deal of sense to        296    00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.360    me it always reminds me of the scene in        297    00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.540    Blazing Saddles where the protagonist        298    00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.339    points a gun in his own head and marches        299    00:12:14.339 --> 00:12:16.800    himself off to jail to save himself for        300    00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.480    an angry mob you can't live holding a        301    00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.519    gun to your own head try and go with        302    00:12:20.519 --> 00:12:22.200    your strength but during that period I        303    00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.940    did study a lot about democracy and I am        304    00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.500    convinced of one thing this is very        305    00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.480    serious there's never been a        306    00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.100    self-governing poety in the history of        307    00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.480    the world where you did not have        308    00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.459    political parties not because anybody        309    00:12:32.459 --> 00:12:34.200    wanted to create them but because that        310    00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.240    is a natural tendency when people come        311    00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.040    together to avoid it just being        312    00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.600    personality and that's especially        313    00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.760    important today the political parties in        314    00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.160    America today are deeply divided on        315    00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.500    issues more divided than they should be        316    00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.860    in my view but a fundamental divide is        317    00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.200    legitimate and my one concern about        318    00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.300    President Obama whom I greatly admire        319    00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.600    during his campaign in 2008 was when he        320    00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.339    announced he was going to govern in a        321    00:12:59.339 --> 00:13:03.120    post party in manner frankly I knew        322    00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.279    the other side and I did not think that        323    00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:07.500    would be possible and I feared he would        324    00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.019    lose out in trying and I told the member        325    00:13:10.019 --> 00:13:11.220    of his staff that when he talked about        326    00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.620    governing in a post-partisan manner he        327    00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.320    gave me postpartisan depression        328    00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.000    I think        329    00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.360    he's experienced a little of it himself        330    00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.139    finally I want to make one serious note        331    00:13:25.139 --> 00:13:26.339    I have        332    00:13:26.339 --> 00:13:28.260    in my pocket        333    00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.940    the most important commencement speech        334    00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.040    ever given I thought I'd look at it it        335    00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.600    was given by Secretary of State George        336    00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.720    Marshall at the Harvard commencement in        337    00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.060    June 5th 1947 when he announced the        338    00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.760    Marshall Plan by the way for those of us        339    00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.260    who are convention speaker here it is in        340    00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.180    its entirety every commencement to take        341    00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.920    on it no the George Marshall changed the        342    00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.560    world in two pages the single space but        343    00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.480    still two pages        344    00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.940    and I cited        345    00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.579    I wanted to tell you how        346    00:13:56.579 --> 00:13:59.399    deeply flattered I am to be speaking the        347    00:13:59.399 --> 00:14:01.380    platform although his speech was the        348    00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.440    tomorrow afternoon speech but I'll take        349    00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.899    Eminence by association even with some        350    00:14:06.899 --> 00:14:08.940    with some distance        351    00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.800    but it's a very important speech it was        352    00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.200    a speech in which he announced the        353    00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.700    decision by the United States under        354    00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.220    Harry Truman with some bipartisanship in        355    00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.360    the Senate        356    00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.180    to go to the aid of a Europe that had        357    00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.100    been devastated by World War II that was        358    00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.519    poor and hungry and defenseless and        359    00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:29.100    facing a brutal Soviet Union        360    00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.800    and for the intervening period America        361    00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.720    has been        362    00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.899    a strong defender of Europe        363    00:14:36.899 --> 00:14:40.440    but you know that was 1947. it was 65        364    00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.660    years later too little has changed in        365    00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.880    our policy by the way        366    00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.000    if you go back in time from Marshall's        367    00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.279    speech in 1947        368    00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:54.480    as far as we are ahead from that time        369    00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.639    the president of the United States is        370    00:14:56.639 --> 00:14:59.639    Chester Arthur a lot of change between        371    00:14:59.639 --> 00:15:01.440    the days of Chester Arthur and Harry        372    00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.540    Truman how much change between Harry        373    00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.519    Truman and our day        374    00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:08.160    there are people here graduates who will        375    00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.600    leave        376    00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.300    far more heavily indebted than a decent        377    00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.060    Society or to have made you do        378    00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.100    there are young people who didn't get        379    00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.019    the education they could get because of        380    00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:21.360    that we have needs that we are not        381    00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.040    addressing to improve the quality of our        382    00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.620    life and part of that is that we are        383    00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.680    still treating our friends and now our        384    00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.199    economic equals in Europe as if they are        385    00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:34.620    our Awards so I've decided today I want        386    00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.839    to announce not simply that I        387    00:15:36.839 --> 00:15:39.240    congratulate the Harvard students        388    00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.699    graduating but I think it's time for us        389    00:15:41.699 --> 00:15:43.980    to announce the graduation of Europe        390    00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.320    65 years after George Marshall's        391    00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.120    wonderful speech        392    00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.060    the notion that America has to be the        393    00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.160    military bulwark for Europe        394    00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.320    the notion that our European allies can        395    00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.160    have        396    00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.540    very good on the way of military        397    00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.980    spending because they encountered        398    00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.079    America to defend them the notion that        399    00:16:01.079 --> 00:16:02.639    we have to have American troops in        400    00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:04.620    Europe and the sixth Fleet is a major        401    00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.180    bulwark        402    00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.399    it's commencement time and there were        403    00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:10.079    places in the world where people need        404    00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:14.100    our help but our continued treating        405    00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.820    Europe as a dependent and we don't do it        406    00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.980    anymore economically with the Marshall        407    00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.560    Plan that part of it but the other part        408    00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.019    of the Marshall Plan was a military        409    00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:27.000    decision        410    00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.459    at the time and now we go to 1949 in        411    00:16:29.459 --> 00:16:32.220    NATO Europe was poor and weak        412    00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.459    and the Soviet Union was brutal and        413    00:16:35.459 --> 00:16:36.839    we're always poor        414    00:16:36.839 --> 00:16:38.820    Solomon was able to mobilize with that        415    00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.100    oppressive Society over the resources to        416    00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.259    be military threatening and so what we        417    00:16:43.259 --> 00:16:46.259    did the United States was to step in and        418    00:16:46.259 --> 00:16:48.300    protect poor and weak Europe from the        419    00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.820    brutal and aggressive Soviet Union there        420    00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.560    is no longer a poor and weak Europe        421    00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.019    there is no longer a brutal and        422    00:16:55.019 --> 00:16:57.420    aggressive Soviet Union it's still a        423    00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.180    Russia not my favorite country I        424    00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.800    continue to be grateful my grandparents        425    00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.839    got the hell out of there        426    00:17:03.839 --> 00:17:06.620    but it is not anything like what it was        427    00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:09.720    60 some odd years ago        428    00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.339    the only thing that hasn't changed is        429    00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:14.160    that America continues to commit tens of        430    00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.140    billions of dollars that we could        431    00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.880    otherwise use for very important        432    00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.220    purposes to improve the quality of life        433    00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.679    both here and elsewhere as if they still        434    00:17:22.679 --> 00:17:25.620    needed us so I closed by        435    00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:29.100    expressing my deep sense of Honor that I        436    00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.860    share a platform 65 years later with one        437    00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:32.760    of the great men in American history        438    00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.039    George Marshall and a commemoration of        439    00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:36.419    one of the Great        440    00:17:36.419 --> 00:17:38.220    unselfish undertaking to American        441    00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.480    history        442    00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.600    but the time has come to say it was a        443    00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.880    success the time has come to declare        444    00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.340    Victory I read this and I read about        445    00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.020    poor Europe and I look at Europe today        446    00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.820    and I say good it worked        447    00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.280    so I close with this for those of you        448    00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.140    who are about to go out and enter the        449    00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.940    political world        450    00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.400    we have a decision to make as a country        451    00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.059    do we continue to act as if        452    00:18:03.059 --> 00:18:06.299    in the aftermath of World War II we had        453    00:18:06.299 --> 00:18:09.120    a requirement that we spend hundreds of        454    00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.860    billions of dollars a year not simply        455    00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.660    protecting ourselves and our Vital        456    00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.240    interests and some who need us but        457    00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.039    whether we were going to spend all that        458    00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:19.740    money to be the dominant power        459    00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.900    everywhere in the world all the time        460    00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.299    even when people don't need us because        461    00:18:24.299 --> 00:18:27.059    understand that's a choice we cannot do        462    00:18:27.059 --> 00:18:30.360    that we cannot continue that policy and        463    00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.980    still maintain a commitment to improving        464    00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.500    the quality of our lives at home and so        465    00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.020    when people say to you        466    00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.460    we cannot afford to do these things that        467    00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.799    I think many of you want to see done I        468    00:18:43.799 --> 00:18:46.320    ask you to put that into the balance and        469    00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.580    I would say        470    00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.840    to quote myself        471    00:18:51.179 --> 00:18:52.799    when I        472    00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.860    look at what we could do with some of        473    00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.480    those funds while still reducing a        474    00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.700    deficit to improve the quality of life        475    00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.100    here at home to spread education more        476    00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.600    widely to improve the environment to        477    00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.360    improve our physical life to        478    00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.220    support health research and all those        479    00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.600    other important things        480    00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.580    compared to what well compared to        481    00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.039    continuing act as if the rest of the        482    00:19:14.039 --> 00:19:16.020    world needed to shelter behind America        483    00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.000    and spend hundreds of billions of        484    00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.620    dollars far beyond our own legitimate        485    00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.780    needs on that purpose I hope that is an        486    00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.059    issue with which you will engage and I        487    00:19:24.059 --> 00:19:25.380    look forward to at least some of you        488    00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.240    being on our side as we write the        489    00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.919    balance happy commencement        490    00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.880    thank you congressman Frank        491    00:19:47.880 -->

both pragmatic and        494    00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.679    idealistic        495    00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:57.299    and we hope that you're not going to        496    00:19:57.299 --> 00:19:58.980    throw out the Harvard 12 sweatshirt that        497    00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.520    we just gave you        498    00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.840    good afternoon class of 2012.

your formative teenage years        167    00:08:18.919 --> 00:08:22.560    were filled with orange alerts and rogue        168    00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.759    waves and unaccomplished        169    00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:30.759    missions for my generation it was AIDS        170    00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:34.039    we all grow up afraid of        171    00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.320    something your        172    00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.760    generation had to get used to taking off        173    00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.760    your shoes at the        174    00:08:40.760 -->

     177    00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.720    protection but during those tough times        178    00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.120    we realized how wonderful it felt to be        179    00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.440    part of a        180    00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.480    group but more about        181    00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.800    me I moved to Chicago in the early        182    00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.760    19990s and I studied improvisation there        183    00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.680    I learned some rules that I try to apply        184    00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.680    still        185    00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.200    today        186    00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.079    listen say yes live in the moment make        187    00:09:22.079 -->

start a scene where two        190    00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.560    people are talking about jumping out of        191    00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.680    a        192    00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.399    plane start the scene having already        193    00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:41.839    jumped if you're scared look into your        194    00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:43.040    partner's        195    00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.040    eyes you will feel        196    00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.600    better this advice has come in handy and        197    00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.600    it and it would often be something I        198    00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.079    would think about when I would perform        199    00:09:54.079 --> 00:09:55.959    on Saturday Night        200

being nervous        203    00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.920    looking into the eyes of the host and        204    00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.200    feeling        205    00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.720    better I should point out I was wearing        206    00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.839    a chicken suit at the        207    00:10:14.839 --> 00:10:18.920    time the host was Donald        208

his eyes I saw that he        211    00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.240    looked really        212    00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.760    stupid and I instantly felt        213    00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.880    better see how that        214    00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.880    works I should point out that that        215    00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.000    sketch was written by a Harvard

much more fun to succeed        245    00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.800    and fail with other        246    00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:08.240    people you can blame them when things go        247

degree in public administration perhaps        54    00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.810    more importantly in terms of preparation        55    00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.259    for leadership the program and able us        56    00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:27.539    to learn and interact with other fellows        57    00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.720    and classmates who represented current        58    00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.970    and potential leaders from all        59    00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.710    continents I readily engaged with that        60    00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.009    opening throat to be among the world's        61    00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.240    best minds yet overwhelmed by the        62    00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.340    reality of being a part of the world's        63    00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.180    most prestigious institution of learning        64    00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.870    as a result I did things that I should        65    00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.800    have done like studying hard going to        66    00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.250    the stacks to do the research for my        67    00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.840    papers and better knowledge of the        68    00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.000    history of my country I'm glad there's        69    00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.680    so many people in here they're like me        70    00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.000    know what the stacks were this were        71    00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.190    those isolated things that contain books        72    00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.330    which people used to read and others        73    00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.750    used to write before Google Scholar was        74    00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.729    created I also did things I should not        75    00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.270    have done like exposing myself to        76    00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.400    frostbite when I joined students much        77    00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.590    younger than me to travel by bus to        78    00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.470    Washington DC to demonstrate against US        79    00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.880    involvement in the Vietnam War        80    00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.260    it is difficult to imagine that writing        81    00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.770    at all that I have achieved today        82    00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.440    without the starting opportunity to        83    00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.580    study at Harvard        84    00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.870    it is therefore for me it profound honor        85    00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.150    to be counted as an alumni I speak with        86    00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.240    utter gratitude and humility when I        87    00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.490    salute my fellow graduates who share the        88    00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.430    rich Harvard heritage of academic        89    00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.070    excellence and truthful pursuits in        90    00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.430    preparation for this address I was        91    00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.030    pleasantly surprised to learn how far        92    00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.250    back Liberia's connection to Harvard        93    00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.010    owes the establishment in 1862 of        94    00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.860    Liberia College now the University of        95    00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.490    Liberia the second oldest institution of        96    00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.550    higher learning in West Africa was led        97    00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.040    and funded by the trustees of the nation        98    00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.580    for education in Liberia        99    00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.490    Simon Greenfield the Harvard College law        100    00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.190    professor who drafted Liberia's        101    00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.210    independence constitution of 1847 was        102    00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.800    the founder and president of that        103    00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.229    institution which is still in existence        104    00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:11.550    today the first Liberian graduate of        105    00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.560    power did so in 1920 and since then        106    00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.940    there has been a study trail of        107    00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.910    Liberians to Cambridge over 32 my count        108    00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.300    most of them returned home to pursue        109    00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.710    successful careers Thank You Harvard        110    00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.530    Thank You president Faust and thank you        111    00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.520    to the many Mason program professors        112    00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.370    dead and alive for the compliments        113    00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:42.840    you've paid when my papers and        114    00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.200    interventions were top rate and for the        115    00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.900    patient's you showed when I struggle the        116    00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.370    quantitative analysis        117    00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:57.439    the self-confidence sometimes called        118    00:07:57.439 --> 00:08:00.679    arrogance that comes from being a        119    00:08:00.679 --> 00:08:04.309    Harvard graduate can also lead one down        120    00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:09.559    a dangerous path it did for me one year        121    00:08:09.559 --> 00:08:11.599    after my return from Cambridge I was        122    00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:14.959    added again in a commencement address at        123    00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:18.619    my high school alma mater I questioned        124    00:08:18.619 --> 00:08:20.599    the government's failure to address        125    00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:23.319    long-standing inequities in a society        126    00:08:23.319 --> 00:08:26.360    this forced me into exile in a staff        127    00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.659    position at the World Bank other similar        128    00:08:29.659 --> 00:08:32.659    events would follow in a life in and out        129    00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:36.649    of country in and out of jail in and out        130    00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:39.860    of professional service there were times        131    00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:44.600    when I thought death was near and times        132    00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.029    on the burden of standing tall by one's        133    00:08:47.029 --> 00:08:49.250    conviction same only to result in        134    00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:53.899    failure but through it all my experience        135    00:08:53.899 --> 00:08:57.769    sends a strong message that failure is        136    00:08:57.769 --> 00:09:02.149    just as important as success you cannot        137    00:09:02.149 --> 00:09:05.240    appreciate success if you do not know        138    00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.600    failure        139    00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.220    just yesterday a student here today I        140    00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.550    stand proud but humble as the first        141    00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.450    woman president of mine country        142    00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:31.139    democratically elected        143    00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.130    this has allowed me to lead the        144    00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.080    protracted processes of national        145    00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.350    transformation change needed to address        146    00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.830    a long-standing environment        147    00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.779    characterized by such awesome challenges        148    00:09:51.779 --> 00:09:56.070    as a collapse economy huge domestic and        149    00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.220    external debt areas dysfunctional        150    00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.700    institutions ruined infrastructure and        151    00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.520    social capital poor regional and        152    00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.460    international relationships or        153    00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.110    completely degraded by the scourge of        154    00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.640    civil war after election I move quickly        155    00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.310    in mobilizing our governance team sought        156    00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.339    support from partners and tackled the        157    00:10:20.339 --> 00:10:24.120    challenges in five years we've        158    00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.310    formulated the laws and policies and        159    00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.190    strategies for growth and development we        160    00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.140    remove the international sanctions on        161    00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.470    our primary exports introduced and made        162    00:10:34.470 -->

investment what sixteen        165    00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:45.450    times the size of the economy when I        166    00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.380    assumed office        167    00:10:53.199 --> 00:10:57.649    we built a small professional army of        168    00:10:57.649 --> 00:11:00.529    Coast Guard move the economy from        169    00:11:00.529 --> 00:11:02.779    negative group to

nevertheless the challenges of        194    00:12:25.709 --> 00:12:27.599    sustained Liberian growth and        195    00:12:27.599 --> 00:12:30.439    development remain both awesome and        196    00:12:30.439 --> 00:12:34.409    performing all our stability is eroded        197    00:12:34.409 --> 00:12:36.629    by thousands of returnees from years        198    00:12:36.629 -->

peace is threatened by        201    00:12:46.469 --> 00:12:49.499    furious neighborhood tensions where we        202    00:12:49.499 --> 00:12:52.589    live two out of our three neighbors have        203    00:12:52.589 --> 00:12:55.349    either experienced or narrowly avoided        204    00:12:55.349 --> 00:12:57.919    civil war in the past year and we        205    00:12:57.919 --> 00:13:01.469    patiently host refugees since not even a        206    00:13:01.469 --> 00:13:05.069    decade ago it was they who hosted so        207    00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:08.339    many of us implementation of our        208    00:13:08.339 --> 00:13:10.169    economic development agenda is        209    00:13:10.169 --> 00:13:13.919    constrained not by funding alone but        210    00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:16.949    also by slow project execution and low        211    00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:20.579    absorptive capacity plans to enhance        212    00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:22.679    performance in governance moves slowly        213    00:13:22.679 --> 00:13:25.709    slower than the desired due to        214    00:13:25.709 --> 00:13:28.229    long-standing institutional decay and a        215    00:13:28.229 --> 00:13:31.379    corrupted value system of dependency and        216    00:13:31.379 --> 00:13:34.649    dishonesty the development of instructor        217    00:13:34.649 --> 00:13:37.679    is hindered by the high capital costs of        218    00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:40.649    restoration and gendered by the lack of        219    00:13:40.649 --> 00:13:43.739    maintenance and exacerbated by wanton        220    00:13:43.739 --> 00:13:45.419    destruction covering more than two        221    00:13:45.419 --> 00:13:51.929    decades of failure yet today we are        222    00:13:51.929 --> 00:13:55.799    proud that Liberian children are back in        223    00:13:55.799 --> 00:13:58.739    school preparing themselves to play a        224    00:13:58.739 --> 00:14:01.649    positive role in the new Liberian        225    00:14:01.649 --> 00:14:06.749    Society our seven-year olds do not hear        226    00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:10.979    guns and do not have to run they can        227    00:14:10.979 --> 00:14:13.609    smile again        228    00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.850    with vaulted area tasks and        229    00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:28.370    transformation in tour we can say with        230    00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:31.700    confidence that we have moved our water        231    00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:37.070    nation from turmoil to peace from        232    00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:43.459    disaster to development from dismay to        233    00:14:43.459 --> 00:14:47.410    hope and in this we are proud to know        234    00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:51.199    that it was the Liberian women who        235    00:14:51.199 --> 00:14:55.149    fought the final battle for peace        236    00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:10.810    they came the number and conviction the        237    00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:13.320    only thing greater than their diversity        238    00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.570    to demonstrate for the entire silver war        239    00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:20.080    and to rededicate their ardent images to        240    00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.680    the peace of pursuit of progress and        241    00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:26.100    therefore proud to stand before you as        242    00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:31.150    ambled by their restless sacrifices to        243    00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:34.900    symbolize also the aspirations and        244    00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.600    expectations of Liberian women African        245    00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.640    women and I dare say women worldwide        246    00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:51.560    I stand before you today equally proud        247    00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.390    to be the first woman president of our        248    00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:58.370    African continent a continent that has        249    00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.220    embraced the process of change and        250    00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.820    transformation I'm proud that Liberia        251    00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.680    could once again become an elevated        252    00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.680    beacon of hope in Africa an opportunity        253    00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.110    to join a few others as a post-conflict        254    00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:17.060    success story Africa must no longer be        255    00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.220    regarded as a continent of countries        256    00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.500    with erupted weak men who rule with iron        257    00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:26.060    fists it is no longer the dark continent        258    00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.370    in continual economic freefall wallowing        259    00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.820    in debt poverty and disease when he        260    00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.850    addressed the Ghanaian Parliament in        261    00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:40.550    2009 President Barack Obama reminded the        262    00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.250    people of Africa that it would no longer        263    00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.430    be the great men of the past who would        264    00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:50.000    transform the continent the future of        265    00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.120    all our countries is in the hands of new        266    00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.560    young people people like you he said        267    00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:01.360    brimming with talent and energy and hope        268    00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.640    who can claim the future that so many in        269    00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.020    previous generations never realized all        270    00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.860    tensions being subdued in Africa today        271    00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.570    it realized the both future can be        272    00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:16.430    reclaimed by solid tendons of        273    00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.339    accountability at the beginning of this        274    00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:22.880    year 17 elections were scheduled across        275    00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:28.339    our continent in 18 in 1989 there were        276    00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:30.740    three democracies in sub-sahara Africa        277    00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:37.110    by 2008 there were 23 that to me        278    00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:40.010    this problem        279    00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:47.020    in the electoral process itself a        280    00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.030    significant improvement from the days        281    00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.910    when violent overthrows were the default        282    00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:55.510    means of transition eclair recent        283    00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.290    examples turns out in West Africa        284    00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:01.660    although they did not get as much focus        285    00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:05.050    as post-election violence in Cote        286    00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:08.650    d'Ivoire leisure and Guinea improve        287    00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:12.070    exemplary when the military oversaw        288    00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:15.520    democratic elections turned power over        289    00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.250    to a civilian government and returned to        290    00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:29.020    the barracks in the case of whatever the        291    00:18:29.020 -->

as the legitimate winner        294    00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:43.000    in previous instances African states who        295    00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.220    stubbornly back the incumbent in        296    00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.840    different parties in conflict today        297    00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.970    African states act in concert on many        298    00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:55.059    substantive issues adopting a common        299    00:18:55.059 --> 00:18:58.860    African position and negotiating as one        300    00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:04.510    that for us is progress we are beginning        301    00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.370    to see evidence of a progressive        302    00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:08.080    environment McNelly        303    00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.410    overall accountability but also in the        304    00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:14.170    performance of the African economy and        305    00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.500    in the economic status of its people the        306    00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.230    index of growth has been growing at over        307    00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:22.920    five percent over the past decade a        308    00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.890    recent African Development Bank report        309    00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.390    measured the rise of the middle

--> 00:19:37.480    experiencing exceptional growth in their        313    00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.490    middle class include Ghana Mozambique        314    00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:47.220    Mali Tanzania kippered Botswana        315    00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.490    Buchan a fossil and Rwanda the middle        316    00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:55.550    class is changing the face of Africa        317    00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.870    instability and years of conflict in        318    00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.060    Liberia have pushed us to the bottom of        319    00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.670    this table in terms of the size of our        320    00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:07.230    middle class we are however preparing a        321    00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:09.870    development agenda that aims through        322    00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.300    proper allocation of our vast natural        323    00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.480    resources to graduate Liberia from        324    00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.090    development assistance in ten years and        325    00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.820    to propel Liberia to middle-income        326    00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:32.550    country by the year 2030 it will the        327    00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:36.030    future of Liberia and Africa must remain        328    00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.970    intimately linked if sustainable        329    00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.270    progress is ever to be realized and        330    00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:47.340    replicated meanwhile I see optimistic        331    00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.610    signs of a continent on the upsurge food        332    00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:53.480    and agriculture base producing        333    00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.520    manufacturing trading and cooperating        334    00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.760    more fully I see an uncompromising        335    00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.280    emphasis on words like accountability        336    00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.210    transparency and reform as elements that        337    00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.460    must adjudicators those decisions        338    00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.740    concerning African governments which        339    00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.950    seek reelection and I see the emergence        340    00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.530    of youthful and truthful leaders ever        341    00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.710    tackled they were talented they were        342    00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.780    chuckling ever learning the pathways        343    00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.520    ahead to progress and development        344    00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.630    especially for the disadvantaged I'm        345    00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:30.990    excited about Africa's future and most        346    00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:34.410    so about Liberia's future in a few        347    00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.230    months the Liberian people will have the        348    00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.210    opportunities to select their political        349    00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:43.110    leadership let me this means that        350    00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.750    Liberia will no a second peaceful        351    00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:49.440    democratic transition in six years this        352    00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.870    in a country that was written by        353    00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.750    political rivalries tribalism and civil        354    00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:58.400    war for two decades it is nonetheless        355    00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.470    with cautious optimism that we approach        356    00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.380    this event and the future        357    00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.919    and scientists remain because we know        358    00:22:07.919 --> 00:22:11.850    that as impressive as liberius rebirth        359    00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:14.610    has been our achievements remain fragile        360    00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:19.140    and reversible anxieties and misgiving        361    00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.640    aside are still utterly confident that        362    00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.710    in a decade long career in public        363    00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.590    service I may have learned many valuable        364    00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:32.220    lessons which I can share with you today        365    00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:36.210    in mine bumpy journey I have come to        366    00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:38.429    value the virtues of hope and resilience        367    00:22:38.429 --> 00:22:43.169    as an actor in liberius history as it        368    00:22:43.169 --> 00:22:46.860    unfolded over the past 40 years I have        369    00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:49.919    seen these characteristics come full        370    00:22:49.919 --> 00:22:54.169    circle I was there in the early 1970s        371    00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:57.390    the decade after independence movement        372    00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:01.740    has swept across Africa back then the        373    00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.600    future's appear full of endless        374    00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.140    possibilities but I also witnessed the        375    00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.590    gradual descent into militarism        376    00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:12.419    sectarian violence and divisive ethnic        377    00:23:12.419 --> 00:23:15.600    politics I witness our country engulfed        378    00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.400    in the fires of a civil conflict that        379    00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.580    raged for almost two decades but in my        380    00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.429    witness I have also been blessed with        381    00:23:23.429 --> 00:23:25.320    the opportunity to watch and participate        382    00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.070    as the nation rises above the ashes of        383    00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.740    war to become a force for peace in West        384    00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:35.970    Africa with cautious optimism it is my        385    00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:38.669    hope that I will continue to lead this        386    00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:40.830    nation to consolidate and realize the        387    00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:46.470    abundant dividends of peace as much as I        388    00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:48.840    have lived an experience do your        389    00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.679    graduates of today what you will know        390    00:23:52.679 --> 00:23:59.000    and what you do will far exceeded        391    00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.450    history it seems a speeding up after        392    00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.309    graduation you leave the relative        393    00:24:05.309 --> 00:24:07.950    security of predictability and certainty        394    00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:11.340    of these wars for a world full of        395    00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.890    accelerated on straight        396    00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:17.570    this across the globe and tyre societies        397    00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.780    are being transformed new identities        398    00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:25.880    Forge and national stories retold people        399    00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.710    your age across the world are becoming        400    00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.930    increasingly vocal about how they are        401    00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:34.040    governed and by whom all templates of        402    00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.190    control have been overturned as states        403    00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.260    struggle internally with issues of our        404    00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:43.190    national character and destiny people        405    00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.380    who heretofore had no say in those        406    00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:48.470    conversations asserting themselves and        407    00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:50.810    taking a place at the table with or        408    00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:54.910    without invitation ten years ago        409    00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:57.320    information about the tragic events of        410    00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.530    September 11 came to us mainly through        411    00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:04.150    traditional media radio television and        412    00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:09.440    cnn.com there was no Facebook no YouTube        413    00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.280    no Twitter and all the other social        414    00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.620    networking sites that might branch a        415    00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.560    renowned take for granted in the        416    00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.810    intervening 10 years young people like        417    00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:23.750    yourselves who graduated today have gone        418    00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:26.090    on to use technology to improve the        419    00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:28.940    overall quality of life and created        420    00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:32.750    wealth in those 10 years the world has        421    00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:36.710    become smaller and more connected ten        422    00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:39.140    years ago the complex financial        423    00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.710    instruments of the day would seem quaint        424    00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:44.630    to the hedge funds and investment banks        425    00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:48.710    of today in those ten years our markets        426    00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:51.410    and our economies have become mostly        427    00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:56.150    connected and rapidly adjusted just six        428    00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:59.650    months ago the Tunisian Revolution began        429    00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:02.600    leaving rapidly and inexorably two        430    00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.730    fundamental change across North Africa        431    00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.460    and the Middle East could this have        432    00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.630    happened without digital social media or        433    00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:14.270    without - correlation of food prices        434    00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:16.300    across time and space        435    00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.920    could this have happened just ten years        436    00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.710    ago with the same precondition but a        437    00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:22.770    different degree        438    00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:27.390    connectivity can you imagine what the        439    00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:31.740    next 10 years will bring the next 50 in        440    00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.470    the time before Friendster succumbed to        441    00:26:34.470 -->

faculty and commencement        444    00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:45.600    speakers have been key actors writers        445    00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.240    chronicles of those changes quite        446    00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.490    impactful on Africa some like US        447    00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.610    Secretary of State George Marshall have        448    00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.340    stood in this very yard the Troy        449    00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:03.150    graduating class such as yours to        450    00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.670    propose a massive post-world War two        451    00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:09.210    plan for reconstruction this would lead        452    00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:12.800    to a take off in global economic growth        453    00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.830    rebounding Europe and a ban reborrowing        454    00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.740    Asia both upon have been catalyzing        455    00:27:19.740 -->

Harvard brag is hooked to this        458    00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:31.970    audience in 1956 as a junior senator        459    00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:35.790    from Massachusetts he pointed to to        460    00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:39.570    Keystone for progress nameless scholarly        461    00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:43.460    objectivity and technological capability        462    00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.280    he said we need both the technical        463    00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.740    judgment and the disinterested viewpoint        464    00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.620    of a scholar to prevent us from becoming        465    00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:57.150    imprisoned for our own slogans in newly        466    00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:00.030    democratic societies where balance a        467    00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:02.580    mark with distinctive icons as well as        468    00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.490    names since many photos remain it later        469    00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:08.100    aid the danger for sloganeering        470    00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.950    political populism is only greater and        471    00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.710    can lead down the road of war not just        472    00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:18.270    bad policy choices Kennedy would go on        473    00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.670    to launch the Peace Corps which has        474    00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.470    impacted the lives of millions        475    00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.080    throughout the world by bringing        476    00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.840    Americans across the ocean teaching        477    00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.460    students and training teachers and        478    00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:31.549    making our world a smaller        479    00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:34.770    Ralph Ellison's speaking at the 1974        480    00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:37.770    commencement told graduates and the        481    00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.710    alumini let us not be dismayed let us        482    00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.799    not lose faith simply because the        483    00:28:43.799 --> 00:28:45.809    correctives we have set in motion and        484    00:28:45.809 --> 00:28:49.070    you have said in motion took a long time        485    00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.480    Ellison believed that despite the        486    00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.570    challenge the chances for national        487    00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:57.630    regeneration was there in the most        488    00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:01.740    recent past Bill Gates the famous        489    00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:08.549    Harvard attendee has made our world        490    00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:11.940    smaller by having us all speak the same        491    00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.429    dialect by connecting us electronically        492    00:29:14.429 --> 00:29:16.950    and opening doors that just one        493    00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:19.080    generation all saying always seem to        494    00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.110    belong to the realm of science fiction        495    00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:23.370    today because of him        496    00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:25.590    we are closer to living in a global        497    00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:30.480    village with the election of Harvard        498    00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:34.590    graduate Barack Obama to the presidency        499    00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:37.710    of the United States the face of        500

00:00:31.340    friends as we celebrate the class of        4    00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.489    2011 and welcome them to our alumni        5    00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.550    ranks I feel a special sense of        6    00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.710    connection to those who just received        7    00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.430    their first degrees do you use the words        8    00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.500    with which I officially greeted them        9    00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.760    this morning I began as president when        10    00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.969    they arrived as freshmen and we have        11    00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.140    shared the past four years here together        12    00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.340    for world-changing years from the global        13    00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.460    financial crisis to a historic        14    00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.940    presidential election to the popular        15    00:01:07.940 -->

and circumstances        18    00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.610    these new alumni face are likely to be        19    00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.290    quite different from the ones they        20    00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.780    expected when they moved into Harvard        21    00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.369    Yard in September 2007 and I hope and        22    00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.430    trust that they too are transformed        23    00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.100    shaped by all they have learned and        24    00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.110    experienced as harvard college        25    00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.159    undergraduates there depart your marks a        26    00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.100    milestone for me as well one that        27    00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.670    prompts me as harvard enters its 370        28    00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.060    fifth year to reflect on what these four        29    00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.509    years have meant for universities and        30    00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.210    what universities must do in this time        31    00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.659    of worldwide challenges when knowledge        32    00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.149    is becoming ever more vital to our        33    00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.450    economies or societies and to us all        34    00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.640    education has never mattered more to in        35    00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.580    individual lives in the midst of the        36    00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.220    Great Recession the unemployment rate        37    00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.860    for college graduates in the United        38    00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.040    States was less than half that for those        39    00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.700    with just a high school diploma those        40    00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.400    with bachelor's degrees earn half again        41    00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.610    as much as high school graduates        42    00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.320    doctor'll or professional grade degrees        43    00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.680    nearly double on average earnings again        44    00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.420    an education of course brings far more        45    00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.930    than economic benefits we believe that        46    00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.540    the graduates of institutions like        47    00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.690    Harvard are instilled with analytic and        48    00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.410    creative habits of mind with a capacity        49    00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.590    for judgment and discernment that can        50    00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.420    guide them through a lifetime that        51    00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.860    promises an abundance of change but        52    00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.470    education is not just about individuals        53    00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.510    education has never mattered more to        54    00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.070    human progress and the common good much        55    00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.250    of what we have undertaken at Harvard in        56    00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.060    these past four years reflects our        57    00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.950    fundamental sense of that responsibility        58    00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.120    to educate individuals who will        59    00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.250    understand the difference between        60    00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.900    information and wisdom who will pose the        61    00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.660    questions and create the knowledge that        62    00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.470    can address the world's problems who can        63    00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.519    situate today's realities in the context        64    00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.450    of the past even as we prepare for the        65    00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.350    future yet universities have been deeply        66    00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.920    affected as events have reshaped the        67    00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.049    educational landscape in the United        68    00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.829    States and abroad the cost of higher        69    00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.160    education has become the source of even        70    00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.400    greater anxiety for American families at        71    00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.519    a time when college matters more than        72    00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.609    ever it seems increasingly less        73    00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.950    affordable access to higher education        74    00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.940    is a national priority and at Harvard we        75    00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.800    have significantly enhanced our        76    00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.740    financial aid policies to make sure that        77    00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.840    Harvard is attainable for talented        78    00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.330    students regardless of their financial        79    00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.590    circumstances this is fundamental to        80    00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.190    sustaining Harvard's excellence more        81    00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.620    than sixty percent of undergraduates        82    00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.320    received financial aid from Harvard this        83    00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.830    year their families paid an average of        84    00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.290    eleven thousand five hundred dollars for        85    00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.350    tuition and room and board the        86    00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.900    composition of our student body has        87    00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.560    changed as a result and we have reached        88    00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.800    out to students who previously would not        89    00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.430    have imagined they could attend this        90    00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.550    past year for example nearly twenty        91    00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.220    percent of the freshman class came from        92    00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.890    families with incomes below sixty        93    00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.810    thousand dollars we want to attract and        94    00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.170    invest in the most talented students        95    00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.240    those likely to take fullest advantage        96    00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.300    of their experience at Harvard College        97    00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.190    our graduate and professional schools        98    00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.670    recognize a similar imperative and seek        99    00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.580    to ensure that graduates are able to        100    00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.070    choose careers based on their        101    00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.400    aspirations rather than on a need to        102    00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.660    repay educational debt the Kennedy        103    00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.810    School for example has made increasing        104    00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.330    financial aid its highest priority        105    00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.310    Harvard Medical School's enhanced        106    00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.550    financial aid policies now assist over        107    00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.870    seventy percent of its student body like        108    00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.230    American families institutions of higher        109    00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.340    education face intensified financial        110    00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.090    challenges as well at our distinguished        111    00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.870    public universities pressures on state        112    00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.340    funding threaten fundamental purposes        113    00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.830    the governor of Pennsylvania for example        114    00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.560    proposes cutting state appropriations        115    00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.030    for higher education by half leaders of        116    00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.660    the University of California system        117    00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.630    warned last week of a possible tuition        118    00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.470    increase of thirty-two percent in        119    00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:57.310    response to reduced state support some        120    00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.950    in Congress are threatening to reduce        121    00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.220    aid for needy students and to constrain        122    00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.370    the federal funding that fuels        123    00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.890    scientific research at Harvard and that        124    00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.860    America's other distinguished        125    00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.490    universities by contrast support for        126    00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.800    higher education and research is        127    00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.630    exploding in other parts of the globe in        128    00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.540    China for example undergraduate student        129    00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.730    numbers have more than quadrupled in        130    00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:31.840    little over a decade India has more than        131    00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.990    doubled its college attendance rate and        132    00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:40.390    plans to do so again by 2020 higher        133    00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.720    education these nations recognize is a        134    00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.330    critical part of building their futures        135    00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.500    as battles raised in watch rage in        136    00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.640    Washington over national priorities and        137    00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.700    deficit reduction we need to make that        138    00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:02.230    case for America as well universities        139    00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.580    are an essential part of the solution        140    00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.440    providing economic opportunity and        141    00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.070    mobility producing discoveries that        142    00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.290    produce prosperity create jobs and        143    00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.440    improve human lives an American higher        144    00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.010    education in its dedication to knowledge        145    00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:28.270    in breadth and depth beyond instrumental        146    00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.050    or narrow technical focus has proved a        147    00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:35.940    generator of imagination wisdom and        148    00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.990    creativity the capacities that serve as        149    00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:43.000    foundations for building our common        150    00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.120    future when I met last        151    00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.350    year with university presidents in China        152    00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.300    they wanted to talk not about science or        153    00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.270    technology where we all know they have        154    00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.540    such strength but instead about the        155    00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.510    liberal arts and how to introduce them        156    00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:05.320    in their country they believed that        157    00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.680    those principles abroad learning had        158    00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.460    yielded the most highly-regarded        159    00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.850    educational system in the world this        160    00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.170    year Ching hua university and Beijing        161    00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.410    introduced a new required course called        162    00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.740    moral reasoning and critical thinking it        163    00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.610    is modeled on professor Michael sandals        164    00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.510    famous Harvard undergraduate class        165    00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.510    justice        166    00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:44.660    and he lectured in that course in        167    00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:49.880    Beijing last week this is a time for us        168    00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.970    to convince Americans of what these        169    00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.480    Chinese educational leaders affirmed to        170    00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.440    me that we in the United States have        171    00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.070    developed a model of higher education        172    00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:07.580    that is unsurpassed in its achievements        173    00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.209    and distinction in the knowledge it has        174    00:10:11.209 --> 00:10:14.480    created and in the students it has        175    00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.640    produced it must be both supported and        176    00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.250    adapted to help secure the future in        177    00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.399    which our children and their children        178    00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:30.200    will live that future encompasses a        179    00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.080    second powerful force shaping higher        180    00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.010    education when Thomas Friedman famously        181    00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.970    proclaimed that the world was flat in        182    00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:44.029    2005 he drew attention to the ways in        183    00:10:44.029 --> 00:10:47.990    which ideas and economies no longer        184    00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.230    respect boundaries knowledge he        185    00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:56.120    emphasized is global yet societies        186    00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.080    cultures and beliefs vary in ways that        187    00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.160    affect us ever more deeply if the world        188    00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.980    is flat it is far from homogeneous        189    00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.500    universities must embrace the breadth of        190    00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.040    ideas and opportunities unfolding across        191    00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.910    the world and at the same time advanced        192    00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:23.750    understanding of the differences among        193    00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.570    distinctive cultures histories and        194    00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:31.730    languages I am repeatedly struck when I        195    00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.520    meet with undergraduates at the        196    00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.640    intensity of their interest in language        197    00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.020    courses which at Harvard now include        198    00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:45.640    nearly 80 languages these undergraduates        199    00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.440    understand the kind of world they will        200    00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.480    live in        201    00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:53.380    and they want to be prepared one member        202    00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.649    of the class of 2011 who will be a        203    00:11:56.649 --> 00:12:00.010    marshal scholar next year told me about        204    00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.160    how she took up the study of Chinese at        205    00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.880    Harvard and when she traveled abroad she        206    00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.839    recognized how speaking the language        207    00:12:09.839 --> 00:12:12.850    transformed her relationship to those        208    00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.300    she meant she said when you learn a        209    00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:20.290    language you get goggles my Chinese        210    00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.680    goggles you have different kinds of        211    00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.709    conversations with people in their own        212    00:12:26.709 --> 00:12:29.800    language we're going to grow up in the        213    00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.139    world together in countries with such        214    00:12:32.139 --> 00:12:36.010    intertwined futures we are she concluded        215    00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:41.380    an international generation in these        216    00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.690    past four years Harvard has reached into        217    00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.060    the world and the world has reached into        218    00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.690    Harvard as never before I have traveled        219

percent of our        257    00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.209    degree students overall but it is not        258    00:14:57.209 --> 00:14:59.509    just knowledge that knows no boundaries        259    00:14:59.509 --> 00:15:02.929    the world's most critical challenges are        260    00:15:02.929 --> 00:15:07.319    often borderless as well and it is these        261    00:15:07.319 --> 00:15:10.139    pressing problems that attract the        262    00:15:10.139 --> 00:15:13.740    interest and talents of so many in our        263    00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.610    community

make a difference in the world        271    00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.309    by creating and disseminating critical        272    00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:45.029    knowledge and we increasingly understand        273    00:15:45.029 --> 00:15:47.579    how to bring the elements of knowledge        274    00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:50.179    creation together by crossing        275    00:15:50.179

often of one University for it is        278    00:16:00.419 --> 00:16:03.660    clear that we work most effectively when        279    00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.939    we unite Harvard's unparalleled        280    00:16:05.939 --> 00:16:09.449    strengths across its schools and fields        281    00:16:09.449 --> 00:16:12.680    and do so at every stage        282    00:16:12.680 -->

capture and sequestration or the        304    00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.439    implications of the Gulf oil spill for        305    00:17:24.439 --> 00:17:27.580    structures of environmental regulation        306    00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:31.720    this brings us finally to innovation a        307    00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.120    third powerful force in higher education        308    00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.780    and in the wider world in which higher        309    00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:42.700    education plays such an important part        310    00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.590    students and faculty working together in        311    00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.990    new ways and across disciplines are        312    00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:50.900    developing

ways        329    00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.740    of enabling those ideas to reach a wider        330    00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.910    world that is the essence of what we are        331    00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:56.020    about and we as an institution have some        332    00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.540    new ideas about how we do our own work        333    00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:03.130    as well we've innovated after 350 years        334    00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:06.280    with governance expanding and enhancing        335    00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:10.270    the corporation we are innovating after        336    00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.670    almost as long with the organization of        337    00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.310    our libraries at the heart of how we        338    00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:18.130    learn and teach we're in the second        339    00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.170    successful year of a new undergraduate        340    00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:23.590    curriculum we created a new School of        341    00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:26.800    Engineering and Applied Sciences we're        342    00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.050    exploring new ways of teaching with new        343    00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:32.380    technologies and new partners we're        344    00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.930    integrating the arts into our teaching        345    00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:38.110    across fields recognizing that the act        346    00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:41.740    of making weather in the arts or perhaps        347    00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.970    in engineering is an essential part of        348    00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.490    creative learning in the fall we will        349    00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.970    open a new innovation lab to foster        350    00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:55.180    team-based invention that connects        351    00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.940    students across disciplines and with        352    00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.110    local entrepreneurs perhaps every        353    00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:05.140    generation believes that it lives in        354    00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:09.100    special times and perhaps every cohort        355    00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.240    of graduates is told just that at        356    00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.910    ceremonies like these but both the depth        357    00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:19.390    of the challenges we face and the power        358    00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:23.680    of knowledge and thus of universities to        359    00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.790    address them        360    00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.840    is unprecedented Harvard must embrace        361    00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.380    this responsibility for it is        362    00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:36.820    accountable to you it's alumni and to        363    00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.870    the wider world universities are among        364    00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.250    humanity's greatest innovations and        365    00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:48.570    among humanity's greatest innovators        366    00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:52.030    through universities we find a better        367    00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:55.350    future where our graduates and their        368    00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:58.090    children and the greater global        369    00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.830    community may lead lives of peace        370    00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:05.680    prosperity and purpose in the centuries        371

especially people who        68    00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.040    didn't it's up to us to be ambassadors        69    00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.959    for this brand to temper hubris with        70    00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.799    humility to defy the stereotypes and        71    00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.000    help others understand that despite our        72    00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.720    degrees we're just normal downto Earth        73    00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.640    people who at 17 happen to be as the        74    00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.680    admissions office like to say in my day        75    00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.280    well lopsided        76    00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.360    individuals when I graduated after a        77    00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.000    stint working for minimum wage at Henry        78    00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.200    Bears Park a toy store on Hon Avenue and        79    00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.920    I'm sorry I'm probably making your        80    00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.079    families a little nervous right now now        81    00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.079    I became a teacher and a book editor        82    00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.079    Pursuits for which my Harvard Education        83    00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.159    had prepared me supremely well because        84    00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.319    it was here that I learned to speak with        85    00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.400    absolute confidence and Authority about        86    00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.359    books which I had not actually        87    00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.120    read I shouldn't really admit this but        88    00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.280    once a section leader wrote on one of my        89    00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.120    finals your essays were exceptionally        90    00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.360    well written and I'd like to give you an        91    00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.160    A but since you couldn't answer any of        92    00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.520    the IDS it's clear you haven't read any        93    00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.280    of these books        94    00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.039    busted now when I was here we didn't        95    00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.800    have classes like science and cooking so        96    00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.759    when I moved to Paris to teach I studied        97    00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.880    at the ctom where I learned practical        98    00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.880    Hands-On things I'd never learned at        99    00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.479    Harvard like how to stuff a quail with        100    00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:01.960    its own        101    00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.479    liver eventually I did what any        102    00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.759    self-respecting history and lit of        103    00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.000    France and America honors concentrator

  existentialism now you know why I was        107    00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.639    working in a toy        108    00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.280    store outto book called can I wear my        109

across the        121    00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.400    country and around the world and over 39        122    00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.360    shared interest groups and most of them        123    00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.160    want to help you in any way they can        124    00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.199    because we believe in the power of this        125    00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.360    institution as a Force for good in the        126    00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.400    world we believe in the power of this        127    00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.880    community and most of all we believe in        128    00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.360    you so I stand here today as the        129    00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.639    incoming president of the haa the        130    00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.639    closest I imagine I'll ever come to        131    00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.280    being king of the world but I can't lie        132    00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.199    to you sometimes it's hard to retain        133    00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:39.039    your sense of self in this community in        134    00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:41.080    which if you win a Pulitzer Prize        135    00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.639    somebody else won a Nobel and if you win        136    00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.560    a Nobel someone else won too so as        137    00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.520    important as I'd like to feel as        138    00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.319    president-elect of this August body when        139    00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:54.120    the commencement and class day speakers        140    00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.960    were announced I quickly understood that        141    00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.680    really all I'd be today was the other        142    00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.800    Ellen the one who isn't the president of        143    00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.280    Liberia and the warm-up act for Amy        144    00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.800    polar which is strange considering the        145    00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.720    similar paths that Amy and I have taken        146    00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.360    we both spent time in Massachusetts        147    00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.360    growing up both did shows with con and        148    00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.319    O'Brien okay mine was a soap opera in        149    00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:23.280    the ma house library and hers was The        150    00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.720    Tonight Show but you know we both        151    00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.960    trained at Second City and in Chicago        152    00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.319    and moved to New York uh where after        153    00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:35.479    that our our paths diverged and I'm okay        154    00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:38.879    with that really I think of the high        155    00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:41.400    holiday story I read every year about        156    00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.039    Rabbi zusa who gets a complex about        157    00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:46.960    Moses and all of the other overachieving        158    00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.000    rabbis he's hanging out with on his        159    00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.159    deathbed he tells his students now I        160    00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:57.039    realize at the end of my life no one is        161    00:07:57.039 --> 00:08:01.759    asking why were you not Moses but why        162    00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:03.759    were you not        163    00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:07.039    Zia I hope you go on to lead countries        164    00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:09.680    and companies and cure the world of its        165    00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.199    ills and create great art and comedy and        166    00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:14.199    new social media as so many of our        167    00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:16.479    distinguished alums have done if that's        168    00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:19.960    what you want to do but forget about        169    00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.720    your Harvard potential a notion which        170    00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.879    has sadly paralyzed more than one of our        171    00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:29.960    Lums and be who you're meant to be and        172    00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.599    who you want to become and let the haa        173    00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:37.039    help you along the way we're celebrating        174    00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:40.039    Harvard's 375th birthday next year and        175    00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.919    my message to alumni is Harvard is where        176    00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.880    you are I mean it will still be here        177    00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.160    it's not going anywhere although        178    00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.200    sometimes just for fun I tell people        179    00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.600    Harvard is changing its name and you        180    00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.480    should see people's        181    00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.560    reactions I hope you'll come back to        182    00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.160    Cambridge often but don't wait for a        183    00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.760    class reunion as far as I'm concerned if        184    00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.040    there are two alums in a room even a        185    00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.800    virtual room it's a reunion on June 21st        186    00:09:06.800 -->

"May 26, 2016",commencement,video,Z3RZWN_DYdc,George Hayward's 2011 Harvard Commencement Speech at Currier House,"No matter how rich or poor we become, no matter how big or small we may be, each of us will experience pain, and setbacks, and defeats. This suffering connects us in a tapestry of empathy, an unspoken understanding among us all that life can knock us down. It is with this in mind that I have decided to share the Harvard Commencement Address I delivered 5 years ago today at Currier House. I had hoped my father would see me graduate because he had helped me so much along the way, but unfortunately he did not make it. It has taken me a great deal of analysis to conclude that ultimately he was there all along. If I could give this speech again, I think I would make it funnier, but that was not my feeling at the time. So I stood there, looking out at a sea of faces in black robes, and with a heavy heart I began. But as I spoke I grew more comfortable, and then something caught my eye. Something I will never forget. Way in the back, behind the final row, there stood a man. He had no cane, no walker, no hospital gown. And then he winked at me. And when I saw my father wink, I smiled back because I finally knew that he was happy. I looked aside for a second, and when I turned back he had stepped away, but my heart now was light. I knew he was still here, just temporarily out of sight.    -George Hayward, May 26, 2016",George Hayward

   00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.240    now I am pleased to present this year's        2    00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:19.800    student speaker George Hayward I want to        3    00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.859    begin by thanking my parents who over        4    00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.769    the last four years we're here for me        5    00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.920    whenever I needed them and also when I        6    00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.809    didn't I want to thank my mother        7    00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.760    Jennifer who is my rock        8    00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.030    I want to thank Harvard which over the        9    00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.670    last four years has become more than a        10    00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.750    school and more than a home I want to        11    00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.629    thank the professors the staff and the        12    00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.239    administration that made Harvard who and        13    00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.710    what it is today        14    00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.100    I must admit        15    00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.120    today graduation is bittersweet for me I        16    00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.880    know one graduate who tried so hard to        17    00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.650    be here today but just couldn't make it        18    00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.250    point two years ago my father awaited        19    00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.110    his commencement from the Law School he        20    00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.380    was young and optimistic just like many        21    00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.500    of us today he looked out not only over        22    00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.070    Terce and Terry theatres but over the        23    00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.710    course of his life ahead he had high        24    00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.090    hopes but for him his life didn't turn        25    00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.330    out as planned in these past four years        26    00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.119    when things got really hard for him we        27    00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.070    used to sit together we'd reflect on        28    00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.070    Harvard he was here in the turbulent 60s        29    00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.490    in the class of 1969 and as a member of        30    00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.280    the class of 2011 thought I too had seen        31    00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.130    some incredible times he would talk        32    00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.200    about the lessons that he learned and        33    00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.399    the lessons that we were learning he'd        34    00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.780    reminisce about the extended cambridge        35    00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.500    winners and those John Harvard statue        36    00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.640    tourists I confirmed that both were        37    00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.209    still here        38    00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.670    and I remember sitting in his hospital        39    00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.709    room hoping against hope that he'd make        40    00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:18.010    it        41    00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.950    - one more commencement but he's not        42    00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.250    here today yet there was a fight in him        43    00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.640    which came from many things but        44    00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.340    especially Harvard he said when he could        45    00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.150    no longer stand he was happy to sit when        46    00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.920    he could no longer sit he was happy to        47    00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.640    hold a loving hand if he said if he        48    00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.590    didn't have years he had months and we        49    00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.299    didn't have months he had days and we        50    00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.160    didn't have days he had this moment and        51    00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.030    I think at Harvard beyond grades beyond        52    00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.860    jobs beyond clubs you learned that        53    00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.700    things don't always go as planned that        54    00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.920    dreams don't always happen as realized        55    00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.120    or intended Harvard is full of success        56    00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.489    in honor as we've seen today but equally        57    00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.889    important are the failures that teach us        58    00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.180    humility        59    00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.280    my father taught me that character is        60    00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.549    forged not by the depths of defeat but        61    00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.920    by the ferocity with which we crawl back        62    00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.689    you know in these past four years we've        63    00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.030    seen things thought impossible just five        64    00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.780    years ago        65    00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.139    the election of a black president the        66    00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.439    collapse of the capital markets the        67    00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.889    capture of Osama bin Laden        68    00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.969    Harvard's adoption of a normal academic        69    00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:44.409    schedule and we've learned a great deal        70    00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.959    by living through it reminds me of one        71    00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.930    of my favorite class of 2011 stories it        72    00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.060    was our first semester in the yard we        73    00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.510    were crammed there it was finals period        74    00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.579    the stress palpable and then an email        75    00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.540    went out over the list I believe it said        76    00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.329    snowball fight in the yard and at first        77    00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.669    there was ten people than a hundred then        78    00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.480    maybe 300 one student even brought a        79    00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.900    shovel he called it his force multiplier        80    00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.699    and I remember looking out at the Dargan        81    00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:26.080    otherwise quiet yard with snowball        82    00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.150    fights frolic and screams in every        83    00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.789    direction and I said I don't know how        84    00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.169    I'm gonna get through this Chinese        85    00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.780    midterm but somehow we're gonna make it        86    00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.130    together so just as in life we learned        87    00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.690    as much by getting through Harvard        88    00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.530    itself as by attending any class and        89    00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.940    it's worth noting that many of the        90    00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.430    people who made today possible can't be        91    00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.550    here today it's not just my father we've        92    00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.550    had family members staff professors        93    00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.789    reverence and administrators who aren't        94    00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.990    here today yet the strength of the        95    00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.680    Harvard community and this education is        96    00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.940    that it's more than the here and now        97    00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.280    it's more than letters and numbers more        98    00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.169    than credits and prerequisites Harvard        99    00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.099    stands for an idea the idea of working        100    00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.530    hard of questioning the status quo of        101    00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.340    taking risks the idea that regardless of        102    00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.770    financial background or cultural        103    00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.020    background you can come here and be        104    00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.620    equal        105    00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.950    the idea that you're here for a snapshot        106    00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.410    in time as my father knew all too well        107    00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.590    but you leave here with the potential to        108    00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.410    make a difference and that's what my        109    00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.970    father told me and that's why I believe        110    00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.950    he's here today this afternoon we begin        111    00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.530    our first day as alums and this year my        112    00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.590    father lived his last but as he looked        113    00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.520    back on it all he told me something and        114    00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.590    that's what I'm here to say that Harvard        115    00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.280    has prepared us and only life will tell        116    00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.990    our stories yet we can emerge triumphant        117    00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.330    if we hold on to the optimism of this        118    00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.120    moment the drive that it took to get        119    00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.150    through this place and the courage to        120    00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.720    continue to learn and grow because if        121    00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.450    Harvard taught me one thing as it's hot        122    00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.080    my father it is that life is not defined        123    00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.680    by adversity but courage in the face of        124    00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.480    it thank you very much

00:01:31.840    oration        30    00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.600    21 years ago what I liked to picture as        31    00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.159    a sunny day in a Valley Hidden Away in        32    00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.320    the Colombian        33    00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.560    Andes a calf was born in my grandparents        34    00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.520    farm this was no ordinary calf you see        35    00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.799    it had a heart-shaped spot right in the        36    00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.520    middle of her forehead that marked her        37    00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.399    as special from the moment of her birth        38    00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.640    like a Bine Harry Potter this Mark would        39    00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.600    forever shape her destiny        40    00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.479    precisely because she was so special she        41    00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.320    was given as a present to two-year-old        42    00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.879    me and I named her        43    00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:11.360    clarant clarant grew and so did I and        44    00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.120    soon it was time for me to go to        45    00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.640    school my parents wanted to send me to a        46    00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.560    school that required a large upfront fee        47    00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.160    they didn't have enough money at the        48    00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.120    time and in the last minute rush they        49    00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.239    made a drastic        50    00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.080    decision clarant was sold to The Butcher        51    00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.440    Shop and made the biggest sacrifice        52    00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.519    anyone has made for my        53    00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.519    education but why am I telling you a        54    00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.680    story about a dead cow on the eve of our        55    00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.280    Harvard        56    00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.480    graduation I bet that's not how the path        57    00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.360    to college got started for most of you        58    00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.560    but I like to think of it as a reminder        59    00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.159    of the many completely unplanned and        60    00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.879    unexpected ways that things can turn out        61    00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.120    and still be okay in the        62    00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.159    end this runs counter to some of the        63    00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.239    things that we've learned as as Harvard        64    00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.239    students we are all here today itching        65    00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.440    to get our hands on that coveted        66    00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.680    diploma because we're compulsive        67    00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.080    planners serial Achievers always working        68    00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.920    towards a goal work hard we've been told        69    00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.120    since we were kids and you would achieve        70    00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.080    your wildest        71    00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.000    dreams and so we work the nights way        72    00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.239    with the sense that if we check all the        73    00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.280    boxes the desired goal must follow we        74    00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.439    have earned it we deserve it and        75    00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:42.720    yet I have a terrible thing to say today        76    00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.799    that all of you already        77    00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.319    know sometimes plans fall        78    00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.239    through even when you do everything        79    00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.640    right even when you work your best and        80    00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.000    try your hardest plans sometimes fall        81    00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.680    through and I should know as my life has        82    00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.480    been a spectacular failure of plan        83    00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.239    making when I was 13 years old I had my        84    00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.480    entire life planned out I knew exactly        85    00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.959    what I was going to study where I was        86    00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.000    going to work when I would get married        87    00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.919    to Ricky Martin and how many children        88    00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.600    we'd have        89    00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.880    together but I also lived in Colombia in        90    00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.600    the early        91    00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.240    2000s        92    00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.479    and the escalating violence one day came        93    00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.600    knocking on my        94    00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.840    door my family was threatened by        95    00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.400    gorillas and within a month we found        96    00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.320    ourselves at the Miami International        97    00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.160    Airport with everything that we could        98    00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.600    fit in four        99    00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.600    suitcases I kicked and screamed and        100    00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.639    complained about the unfathomable        101    00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.479    unfairness of the        102    00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.759    world but life has an implacable way of        103    00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.600    continuing without break regardless of        104    00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.440    of how we feel about our broken hearts        105    00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.240    or trampled        106    00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.160    dreams all too soon I had to pick myself        107    00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.759    up learn English go to school like        108    00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.680    everybody else and although it was never        109    00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.680    the plan to begin with I somehow ended        110    00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.120    up at Harvard with the rest of        111    00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.000    you during my sophomore year at Harvard        112    00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.160    my family's Asylum case came to its        113    00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.919    final step in        114    00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.880    court despite nearly a decade of        115    00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.880    building a new New Life working hard and        116    00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.280    doing everything right plans fell        117    00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.800    through our Asylum claim was denied and        118    00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.720    once again we found ourselves packing        119    00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.759    what we could fit into a        120    00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.199    suitcase 3 years ago I left Harvard not        121    00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.720    knowing when I would once again have the        122    00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.199    luxury of pulling all nighters at Lamont        123    00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.600    or complaining over the foo open list of        124    00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.840    the lack of hot breakfast        125    00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.800    I left Harvard with the fear that I        126    00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.000    might have forever GI given up the        127    00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.440    opportunity to wait with you tomorrow        128    00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.520    for that piece of paper that would        129    00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.240    validate all of my        130    00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.319    efforts and the year that I was gone        131    00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:18.520    hoping and waiting for a        132    00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.120    Visa I found that not being able to drop        133    00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.759    the hbomb and        134    00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:26.720    conversation or have it top my resume        135    00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.880    like a golden seal of Excellence didn't        136    00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.360    really matter as much        137    00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.240    anymore I missed arguing with my friends        138    00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.720    in the dining        139    00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.680    hall I missed walking into anenberg and        140    00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.319    being reminded of that crazy dream that        141    00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:45.440    it is to be a Harvard student and to be        142    00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.560    fair I miss saying really        143    00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.160    overgeneralized things like that so        144    00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.840    several thousand Harvard grads could        145    00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.720    relate though I missed Harvard very much        146    00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.000    unexpected and wonderful things happened        147    00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.440    when I was gone too        148    00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.319    I rediscovered a place that was        149    00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:04.840    recovering violence though I never        150    00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.919    planned to ride and I hardly knew who        151    00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:09.360    the president was I ended up working as        152    00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.479    a journalist and covering the most        153    00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:14.520    exciting presidential elections in        154    00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.360    decades I had a chance to remet my        155    00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.840    family to travel to embarrass myself        156    00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.639    trying to salsa dance almost every        157    00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:24.680    weekend and        158    00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.360    though I never really knew whether I was        159    00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.440    coming back to Harvard and I always        160    00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.319    hoped to my unexpected Year back in my        161    00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:37.879    country was Unforgettable in its own        162    00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:42.960    way I cannot step in this in front of        163    00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.159    this microphone the same age as the rest        164    00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:48.440    of you and probably less        165    00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.560    smart and presume to impart on you some        166    00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.599    sort of wisdom that you haven't yet        167    00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.440    discovered on your        168    00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.080    own all I can share is what I've learned        169    00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.800    from my my uncanny ability to have my        170    00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.639    life plans completely fall        171    00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:06.360    through even if you don't go where you        172    00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.440    thought you were going give yourself the        173    00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.319    space and opportunity to discover        174    00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:14.520    something you enjoy and perhaps even you        175    00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.639    love every once in a while have the        176    00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:22.440    courage to not have plans and wait for        177    00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.879    the wonderful things that could        178    00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.639    happen my life has been full of really        179    00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:32.839    unexpected turns from killing my cow to        180    00:08:32.839 --> 00:08:34.519    shuttling between countries never        181    00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:37.440    knowing what I would be in 6        182    00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.360    months yet in the midst of        183    00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.839    uncertainty I found        184    00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:47.120    fulfillment and I ended up with better        185    00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.279    experiences than anything I could have        186    00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:53.120    actually planned I was        187    00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.160    here when things don't go the way you        188    00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.360    hoped people will always tell you        189    00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.360    everything happens for a        190    00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.200    reason I I don't know if that's        191    00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.480    true honestly I actually really hate to        192    00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.480    hear people tell me that        193    00:09:14.079 --> 00:09:17.279    but when I look at the way that things        194    00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:19.040    happened in the past few years it's        195    00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.040    really hard for me not to        196    00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.920    think I'm really glad that nothing ever        197    00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.120    really worked out as I had        198    00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.839    planned congratulations class of        199    00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:35.800    2011 I hope that your plans fail in        200    00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.160    really awesome        201    00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.440    ways thank        202    00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:47.519    you

   00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.679    as the oldest university in the country        2    00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.960    Harvard has a long history of        3    00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.480    tradition during my last year here I        4    00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.840    made it my mission to learn those        5    00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.600    Traditions as        6    00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.920    possible in this process I chanced upon        7    00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.240    one that I don't entirely understand        8    00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.720    that of the three-legged chair that        9    00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.480    President fa sits on        10    00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.559    today apparently this chair was        11    00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.280    purchased by former Harvard president        12    00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.520    Edward Holio and has been used during        13    00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.840    convocations and commencements ever        14    00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.120    since though the story is intriguing I        15    00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.960    had to wonder who really needs a        16    00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.359    three-legged        17    00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.600    chair how could three legs possibly be        18    00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.800    better than        19    00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.760    four and what does this say about        20    00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.240    Harvard the more I thought about the        21    00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.400    three legs that support that chair the        22    00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.520    more I thought about what has supported        23    00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.240    me during my time at        24    00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.400    Harvard as I reflect on the entirety of        25    00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.079    my liberal arts        26    00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.400    education I realize that the        27    00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.640    foundational knowledge I have acquired        28    00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.799    is not exactly what I expected it to be        29    00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.759    as a chemistry concentrator I thought        30    00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.640    that reaction mechanisms or the periodic        31    00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.399    table might be my        32    00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.479    Foundation but while I'm so thankful to        33    00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.280    have learned from the dedicated        34    00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.439    chemistry professors at        35    00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.399    Harvard this single subject is not what        36    00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:52.439    supports        37    00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.200    me instead it's the learning across        38    00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.079    disciplines that has given my classmates        39    00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:00.439    and me        40    00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.840    a framework to think about the        41    00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.079    world chemistry is not just chemistry        42    00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.000    it's one of the many subjects where        43    00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.080    women have traditionally been        44    00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.040    underrepresented as I learned in the        45    00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.000    women and gender studies        46    00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.920    Department it's also a mystical science        47    00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.360    that English literature has sought to        48    00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.599    depict for Generations dating back to        49    00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.120    the poison dispensing Apothecary of        50    00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.319    Romeo and        51    00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.519    Juliet by understanding the ways that my        52    00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.360    primary concentration relates to other        53    00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.959    disciplines I can try to make sense of        54    00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.480    the world through a more complete point        55    00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.360    of        56    00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.800    view this liberal arts education makes        57    00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.000    up part of the foundation that we will        58    00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.680    leave Harvard with one of the legs of        59    00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.560    that special        60    00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.480    chair as I leave Harvard I am also        61    00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.120    thankful for the classmates who have        62    00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.360    stood up for their beliefs and        63    00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.840    challenged me to do the        64    00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.400    same I remember way back to opening days        65    00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.000    to the community conversations where we        66    00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.360    were expected to discuss difficult        67    00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.280    issues of bioethics race and        68    00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.799    class personally I was scared out of my        69    00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.920    mind and in retrospect I'm sure that        70    00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.640    many of my classmates experience those        71    00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.440    same feelings of        72    00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.319    fear we were unsure of how to express        73    00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.959    ourselves        74    00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.959    unsure of how our beliefs might then        75    00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.400    impact our personal        76    00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.480    relationships but then slowly over the        77    00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.640    past four years my peers taught me to be        78    00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.720    less        79    00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.400    afraid to share the opinions and beliefs        80    00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.439    that I hold dear and to invite others to        81    00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:55.200    be open and honest with        82    00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.680    me now when I see something like the        83    00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.280    inequalities in our education system I        84    00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.710    want to talk about        85    00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.879    [Applause]        86    00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.799    them to hear from others and to seek out        87    00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.840    Solutions when talk turns to religion        88    00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.760    and        89    00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.799    spirituality I am excited to share my        90    00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.479    beliefs and to learn from those of        91    00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.840    others because of the support of        92    00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.680    students around me I've learned to be        93    00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.720    proud of my class classmates beliefs and        94    00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.039    accomplishments and to value my own        95    00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.960    contributions as a small part of a        96    00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.520    potential        97    00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.160    solution after all this sharing of ideas        98    00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.400    is the only way real change can happen        99    00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.680    and it composes the second leg of that        100    00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.680    traditional        101    00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.880    chair I have also come to depend on the        102    00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.720    community that surrounds        103    00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.720    Harvard during my sophomore year I        104    00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.759    worked for a summer Camp through the        105    00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.880    Philips Brooks house        106    00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.479    Association through this program I had        107    00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.520    the opportunity to get to know a group        108    00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.800    of high school students who had recently        109    00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.320    moved here to Boston from different        110    00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.759    countries all over the        111    00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.440    world at one point during the summer one        112    00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.199    students family invited the staff over        113    00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.319    for dinner wanting to share with us both        114    00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.919    their food and their stories        115    00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.520    they told of leaving their home country        116    00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.680    of Iraq as        117    00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.360    refugees coming to the United States        118    00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.039    where despite their graduate level        119    00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.560    degrees they found it impossible to find        120    00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.919    work due to both the language barrier        121    00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.800    and the Prejudice that they encountered        122    00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.319    here their willingness to share and be        123    00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:57.440    vulnerable reminded me of the kind of        124    00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.880    familial love that so so easy to forget        125    00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.680    about on a college        126    00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.960    campus I am so glad that Harvard is        127    00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.039    located in the midst of such a great        128    00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:13.319    community and I hope that future        129    00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:16.440    students will continue to explore the        130    00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.199    areas around them and get to know the        131    00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.039    issues that face the community they live        132    00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:28.000    in so then we have three legs three legs        133    00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.520    of the chair that president f is sitting        134    00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.039    on today and three legs of academics and        135    00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:37.400    peers and        136    00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.639    Community but what happened to that        137    00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:43.440    fourth leg and why was it left        138    00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.039    out perhaps that fourth leg was left out        139    00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:50.840    strategically to remind us that our        140    00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.720    learning experiences are not over and        141    00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.160    that we must continue to seek out        142    00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.840    opportunities to build our support        143    00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.039    systems in years to        144    00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:06.000    come hopefully as we think back on all        145    00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.080    of Harvard's many        146    00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.759    Traditions that missing leg will serve        147    00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:13.759    as a reminder to take the lessons we        148    00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:16.000    learned here        149    00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.240    forward graduation may be today but the        150    00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.479    search for the missing leg can go on as        151    00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:25.880    long as we live        152    00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.699    [Applause]

speaker        6    00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.739    someone who are you Toby what are you        7    00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:20.820    doing why are you announcing this        8    00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.560    speaker there's one more award to give        9    00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.210    out but what what are you talking about        10    00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.849    I mean it's not on our script well well        11    00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.700    no it's this really prestigious award        12    00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.160    it's given out annually and by annually        13    00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.989    I mean that this is the first year it's        14    00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.240    being given out Lizzy that doesn't make        15    00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.290    any sense how can award        16    00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.450    he's so prestigious if no one's ever won        17    00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.370    it that's exactly why it's so        18    00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.350    prestigious the qualifications are        19    00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.660    pretty strict fine so if you know so        20    00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.010    much about this award why don't you        21    00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.410    share with the audience okay well first        22    00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.540    and foremost the recipient of this award        23    00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.690    must be blonde the rules make no        24    00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.800    distinction between natural and dyed        25    00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.570    Lizzy that's sort of vague I mean what        26    00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.680    does being blonde have to do with        27    00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.000    winning an award are you are you trying        28    00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.430    to give yourself an award right now Toby        29    00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.630    I'm flattered you think I'm qualified        30    00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.150    but I am not the recipient of this award        31    00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.280    must also have graduated from Boston        32

00:01:18.180    I don't really get it why are we giving        35    00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.920    an award to a non Harvard graduate today        36    00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.600    I mean I thought the theme of today was        37    00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.100    self aggrandizement        38    00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.610    Toby don't be rude even BC has one or        39    00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.570    two worthwhile alums anyway the        40    00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.310    recipient must also have appeared in        41    00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.130    times

person        44    00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.820    also an Emmy nominee does she star in        45    00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.290    her own television show and he's your        46    00:01:44.290

you're        51    00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.000    really getting the hang of this        52    00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.400    and we found out at lunch that she        53    00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.440    turned down the role of Laura Croft Tomb        54    00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.869    Raider because she was quote in too good        55    00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.920    of shape but you know I think by now        56    00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.509    everyone is sort of reading between the        57    00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.730    lines so let's just do this yeah agreed

relied on the close        127    00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.590    relationships between physical oil        128    00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.720    prices and the prices of financial        129    00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.180    futures which of course as we all know        130    00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:41.669    moves in parallel hilarious        131    00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.930    what

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.000    who get rich by either inventing things        137    00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.030    or suing the people who claim they stole        138    00:07:04.030 -->

   193    00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.740    you held you in the palm of their hand        194    00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:22.310    God Allah Buddha gaga        195    00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:26.950    whomever you pray to they have helped        196    00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.590    you get here that should make you feel        197    00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:34.420    less alone and less scared because it        198    00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:40.450    has been a scary 10 years you were young        199    00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.900    children when you watched planes hit the        200    00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.290    World Trade Center you quickly        201    00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:51.310    understood what it was like to feel out        202    00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:55.560    of control your formative teenage years        203    00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.320    were filled with orange alerts and rogue        204    00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.540    waves and unaccomplished missions for my        205    00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:08.980    generation it was aids we all grow up        206    00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:14.920    afraid of something your generation had        207    00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.870    to get used to taking off your shoes at        208    00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:21.040    the airport my generation had to get        209    00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.830    used to awkward PSAs from boys to men        210    00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:29.260    telling us to use protection but during        211    00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.800    those tough times we realized how        212    00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.330    wonderful it felt to be part of a group        213    00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:43.510    but more about me I moved to Chicago in        214    00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.000    the early 1990s and I studied        215    00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.180    improvisation there I learned some rules        216    00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:54.870    that I try to apply still today listen        217    00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:59.920    say yes live in the moment make sure you        218    00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.070    play with people who have your back make        219    00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:07.510    big choices early and often don't start        220    00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.000    a scene where two people are talking        221    00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.600    about jumping out of a plane start the        222    00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.110    scene having already jumped if you're        223    00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.670    scared look into your partner's eyes you        224    00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.610    will feel better        225    00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:28.600    this advice has come in handy and it it        226    00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.460    would often be something I would think        227    00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.930    about when I would perform on Saturday        228    00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:33.600    Night Live        229    00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.070    live television can be very        230    00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:40.000    nerve-racking and I remember one time        231    00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.060    being nervous looking into the eyes of        232    00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:47.980    the host and feeling better I should        233    00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.720    point out I was wearing a chicken suit        234    00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:58.690    at the time the host was Donald Trump he        235    00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.510    was wearing a bigger more elaborate        236    00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:07.620    chicken suit I looked into his eyes I        237    00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.950    saw that he looked really stupid and I        238    00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:15.910    instantly felt better see how that works        239    00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.779    I should point out that that sketch was        240    00:13:19.779 --> 00:13:23.110    written by a Harvard Graduate and also a        241    00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.760    graduate from Northwestern but who cares        242    00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.510    about that am i right I cannot stress        243    00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:32.470    enough that the answer to a lot of your        244    00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:35.920    life's questions is often in someone        245    00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.930    else's face try putting your iPhone's        246    00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.680    down every once in a while and look at        247    00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.520    people's faces people's faces will tell        248    00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.610    you amazing things like if they are        249    00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:57.180    angry or nauseous or sleep        250    00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.360    I've been lucky to be a part of great        251    00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.000    ensembles my work with The Upright        252    00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.910    Citizens Brigade led me to my work on        253    00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.759    Saturday Night Live and when I graduated        254    00:14:09.759 --> 00:14:12.730    from that comedy College I was worried        255    00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.730    about what came next        256    00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.529    then Parks and Recreation came along a        257    00:14:17.529 --> 00:14:19.480    show I'm proud of where I get to work        258    00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.290    with people I love you never know what        259    00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.970    is around the corner unless you peek        260    00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.910    hold someone's hand while you do it        261    00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:34.990    you'll feel less scared you can't do        262    00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.269    this alone        263    00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:39.310    besides it's much more fun to succeed        264    00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.550    and fail with other people you can blame        265    00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:46.899    them when things go wrong take your        266    00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:51.459    risks now as you grow older you become        267    00:14:51.459 --> 00:14:55.540    more fearful and less flexible and I        268    00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.939    mean that literally        269    00:14:57.939 --> 00:15:02.559    I hurt my knee on the treadmill this        270    00:15:02.559 --> 00:15:12.789    week and it wasn't even on try to keep        271    00:15:12.789 --> 00:15:15.609    your mind open to possibilities and your        272    00:15:15.609 --> 00:15:17.769    mouth closed on matters that you don't        273    00:15:17.769 --> 00:15:21.669    know about limit your always and your        274    00:15:21.669 --> 00:15:25.659    Nevers continue to share your heart with        275    00:15:25.659 --> 00:15:29.619    people even if it's been broken don't        276    00:15:29.619 --> 00:15:32.409    treat your heart like an action figure        277    00:15:32.409 --> 00:15:35.819    wrapped in plastic and never used and        278    00:15:35.819 --> 00:15:38.679    don't try to give you that nerd argument        279    00:15:38.679 --> 00:15:40.449    that your heart is a Batman with a        280    00:15:40.449 --> 00:15:42.549    limited edition silver Batarang and        281    00:15:42.549 --> 00:15:44.649    therefore if it stays in its original        282    00:15:44.649 --> 00:15:48.699    packing and increases in value watch it        283    00:15:48.699 --> 00:15:51.809    Harvard you're not better than me        284    00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:57.359    even though as a class you are smart        285    00:15:57.359 --> 00:16:02.129    you're still allowed to say I don't know        286    00:16:02.129 --> 00:16:06.189    just because you are in high demand you        287    00:16:06.189 --> 00:16:08.769    are still allowed to say let me get back        288    00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:13.689    to you this will come in handy when your        289    00:16:13.689 --> 00:16:16.329    parents ask when you plan to move out of        290    00:16:16.329 --> 00:16:18.809    their basement        291    00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:25.160    and you answer I don't know let me get        292    00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.790    back to you        293    00:16:30.279 --> 00:16:35.839    which leads me to my final thought would        294    00:16:35.839 --> 00:16:39.579    it kill you to be nicer to your parents        295    00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:50.600    they have sacrificed so much for you and        296    00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.240    all they want you to do is smile and        297    00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.220    take a picture with your weird cousins        298    00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:01.160    do that for them and with less eye        299

  00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.200    ranks the American revolutionaries knew        42    00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.560    the value        43    00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.959    of thinking for themselves and fighting        44    00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.400    for each other they struck out on their        45    00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.560    own yet they built something new        46

--> 00:03:36.599    well there are nine graduate schools I        60    00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.360    can do you all we be here all day        61    00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.920    but but we love you        62    00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.959    too but we live in in a world of        63    00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.720    creeping        64    00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.400    homogenization a blue planet that's        65    00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.680    becoming small and gray where a language        66    00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.519    is set to die every 14 days where        67    00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.280    globalization is put Starbucks on every        68    00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.239    street corner where Google has made the        69    00:04:04.239 -->

dissertations on        72    00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.160    time are we all beginning to speak to        73    00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.359    see to sound the same and even think        74    00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.560    alike according to one recent study half        75    00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.280    of all college students showed no        76    00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.199    improvement in their capacity for        77    00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.360    independent Thinking by the end of their        78    00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.759    sof more year even while        79    00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.919    sober it's nothing new 50 years ago Yale        80    00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.520    psychologist Stanley Milgram showed us        81    00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.720    how dangerous how pervasive Conformity        82    00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.840    could be 65% of people in his famous        83    00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.680    experiment were prepared to inflict an        84    00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.840    electric shock simply when asked to do        85    00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.919    so but then what else do you do for        86    00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.639    entertainment in New Heaven on a Tuesday        87    00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.680    night at its        88    00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.720    best the university is an incubator of        89    00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.560    independent inquiry a cacophony of        90    00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.039    voices opinions arguments a living        91    00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.600    debate that reshapes us as we shape it        92    00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.720    but here's the irony that a graduate we        93    00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.319    must first Master the establish        94    00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:32.919    theories so though we're meant to stand        95    00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.039    here on the shoulders of giants it can        96    00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:38.400    sometimes feel as if that body of        97    00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.199    accumulated learning all the tried and        98    00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.880    tested Frameworks and formulas are        99    00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.600    weighing down upon us crushing our        100    00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.880    creativity and threatening to sink us if        101    00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.000    we're not careful in a world where the        102    00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.880    deepest problems defy easy resolution        103    00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.039    surely the greatest risk is not taking        104    00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:01.800    risks at        105    00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.919    all so will we have the        106    00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.560    courage to mount our own quiet        107    00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.120    Revolution Generations ago there was an        108    00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.199    army of people drawn here from many        109    00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:20.919    lands that rejected the status quo that        110    00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:24.160    turned their world upside        111    00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.319    down so let's salute them the dissenters        112    00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:32.560    the Mavericks and Heretics pioneers and        113    00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.199    Prime movers who know that without our        114    00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:38.840    willing to be wrong we can never be        115    00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.560    right that it's only by questioning what        116    00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.520    is that we can begin to imagine what        117    00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.639    might be that it's in our        118    00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.599    originality that we will find Humanity's        119    00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:52.319    greatest        120    00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:57.520    hope the world needs less of the same it        121    00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.639    needs us to work together and think for        122    00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:01.800    ourselves it needs the Commonwealth of        123    00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.120    us and the Republic of you so together        124    00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.000    let's make today our independence day        125    00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.199    and in our Liberty strive to serve the        126    00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:16.030    common good        127    00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.620

00:01:44.720    masters though undoubtedly we are        43    00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.320    if i were to set up a flip chart here on        44    00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.000    stage and we together try to draft a        45    00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.759    communal definition of the domain and        46    00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.520    purpose of education        47    00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.360    would we measure our time on this basic        48    00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.560    task in minutes or weeks would we ever        49    00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.880    together as masters        50    00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.640    be able        51    00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.479    what about citizenship        52    00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.880    quality education        53    00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.880    beyond the theoretical the existential        54    00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.720    questions who am i who am i from        55    00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.720    cambridge to dream up policies and        56    00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.319    programs that will affect people on the        57    00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.319    other side of the world        58    00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.760    a popular mantra in the development        59    00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.120    community is that the days of the white        60    00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.720    man parachuting in to solve the world's        61    00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.200    problems are long gone well my degree is        62    00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.640    international education and they don't        63    00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.920    come too much wider than i am        64    00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.800    maybe at harvard they do but        65    00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.879    the question remains        66    00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.239    who am i        67    00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.720    to theorize about the real lives of        68    00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.959    people i'll never meet        69    00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.280    an indian teacher trainer and hgse alum        70    00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.360    i heard speak a few weeks months back        71    00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.360    recounted how after a highly successful        72    00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.760    program on exploratory student-centered        73    00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.720    learning        74    00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.920    one of his students approached him and        75    00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.680    invited him back to her rural gujarati        76    00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.200    school        77    00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.480    when they arrived he was surprised to        78    00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.480    find 60 barefoot children sitting on the        79    00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.400    floor around him a student came up to        80    00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.599    him with a piece of chalk and she said        81    00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:58.879    can you hear        82    00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.480    with these children        83    00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.080    teaching the way you taught in your        84    00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.400    workshop        85    00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.319    looked around at the children over at        86    00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.560    the crack blackboard and you realized        87    00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.319    he couldn't        88    00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.360    could you        89    00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.280    and more importantly much more        90    00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.360    importantly could you get out of bed and        91    00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.920    do it again the next day and the next        92    00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.920    and for the rest of your life not a        93    00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.680    two-year stint with teeth for america

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.319    share a story from our own class marshal        114    00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.840    rich        115    00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.280    rich's niece started kindergarten        116    00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.319    sorry rich        117    00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.760    rich's niece started kindergarten this        118    00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.680    past september she came home from her        119    00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.519    very first day and excitedly told her        120    00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.439    parents about the people she'd met the        121    00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:17.199    things she'd learned        122    00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.720    as her father tucked her into bed that        123    00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.000    night he leaned over and said so        124    00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.840    sweetheart you excited to go back to        125    00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.520    school tomorrow        126    00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.800    she looked up at him with a confused        127    00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.040    smile and she said no daddy i i already        128    00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.840    went to school        129    00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.680    well how do you explain that one        130    00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.040    not the end of a journey the        131    00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.280    introduction not the last step        132    00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.520    the first that tomorrow        133    00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.600    is a school day        134    00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.800    for me        135    00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.199    that's where we are today        136    00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.280    with our masters and doctors still fresh        137    00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.360    a year or eight        138    00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.040    of learning behind us        139    00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.560    we are lying in bed with a choice to        140    00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.360    make        141    00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.960    was our time here our day of        142    00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.240    kindergarten        143    00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.320    the sum total of our learning        144    00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.080    or the orientation session to something        145    00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.080    much more meaningful have we mastered        146    00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.360    education        147    00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.160    or have we simply taken a step        148    00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.680    here is perhaps the one thing i am a        149    00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.320    master of i know that what i know what        150    00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.800    i've learned here is a strong foundation        151    00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.840    but it is not a series of solutions        152    00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.160    that real answers are contextual and        153    00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.759    complicated and they are not written on        154    00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.360    the back of my harvard degree and are        155    00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.960    not guaranteed by the quality of my        156    00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.759    education the purity of my intentions or        157    00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:30.479    the novelty of my approach        158    00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.240    for as much        159    00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.160    as we are rightly encouraged to go out        160    00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.600    and make our mark        161    00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.759    we do not leave the world a better place        162    00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:39.680    simply because we leave it different        163    00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.840    innovation is not a synonym for progress        164    00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.919    any more than development is a synonym        165    00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.520    for happiness        166    00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.919    as educators our call to action is not        167    00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.080    what can i make happen what can i change        168    00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.199    but rather        169    00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.199    what needs to be done        170    00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:54.960    and our accomplishments if they mean        171    00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.639    anything at all will not be measured in        172    00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.479    the programs we implement the citations        173    00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.639    we accumulate or the influence we wield        174    00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.039    than the dignity compassion and        175    00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:04.800    opportunity we contribute to the world        176    00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.199    through the lives we touch        177    00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.479    i don't know        178    00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:10.160    how to affect widespread change in rural        179    00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.240    india i don't know how to best use        180    00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.319    technology to help inner city learners        181    00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:15.680    in chicago        182    00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.280    i don't know how to most effectively        183    00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.800    crush the hopes and dreams of those        184    00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.000    greedy greedy teachers in wisconsin        185    00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.800    their healthcare        186    00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.800    i and perhaps we are not masters of        187    00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.960    knowing certainly not of pretending to        188    00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.759    know        189    00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:38.800    if anything with pride we are masters of        190    00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.080    i don't know        191    00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.080    i don't know        192    00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.080    but i can help you find out i don't know        193    00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.919    but if you teach me        194    00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:49.199    i can teach you too and for today        195    00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:50.240    for me        196    00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.759    that's something to take pride in it for        197    00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:52.880    today        198    00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.240    it's enough        199    00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.800    because today was a beginning        200    00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.080    and tomorrow        201    00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.919    is a school day        202    00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.120    and i know        203    00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.400    as we go out        204    00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.160    as teachers educational leaders        205    00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.000    policymakers and program managers as we        206    00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.080    listen and are listened to as we shape        207    00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.599    and are shaped by the events surrounding        208    00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:10.319    us        209    00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:11.759    we will look back at the degrees we        210    00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.919    receive tomorrow not as certificates of        211    00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:15.759    mastery or as affirmation of our        212    00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:16.800    assumptions        213    00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.360    but invitations to a lifelong dialogue        214    00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.360    to a lifetime of learning no less than        215    00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.400    we teach        216    00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.440    adapting no less than we transform        217    00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.880    for as much as the world needs the        218    00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.120    genius beneath this tent today        219    00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.039    for as much as education needs you to        220    00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:34.000    lead it needs more the quiet heroism of        221    00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.120    practitioners who don't simply        222    00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.880    proselytize the change they want to see        223    00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.800    in the world but live it        224    00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.080    reflectively        225    00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.000    and humbly        226    00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.680    today for me        227    00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.680    was the first day of kindergarten        228    00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.840    on monday in early september and we are        229    00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.599    all lying in bed with a choice to make        230

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.749    penetrate penetrating questions that        50    00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:56.670    would send members of the Supreme Court        51    00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.439    Bar searching for packets of        52    00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:03.389    alka-seltzer but President Obama added        53    00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.840    of Justice Souter        54

00:04:11.810    thank you more than I can say Madam        62    00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.650    President Madam President it's becoming        63    00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.169    habitual members of the of the governing        64    00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.300    boards and ladies and gentlemen when I        65    00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.580    was younger I used to hear Harvard        66    00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.440    stories from a member of the class at        67    00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.710    1885 back back then old graduates of the        68    00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.479    college who could get to Cambridge on        69    00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.030    commencement day didn't wait for a union        70    00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.040    years to come back they just turn up see        71    00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.380    their old friends look at the new crop        72    00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.500    and drink some commencement punch under        73    00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.740    the Elms and the old man remembered one        74    00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.200    of those summer days when he was heading        75    00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.270    for the square after lunch and he        76    00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.789    crossed paths was one of the newly        77    00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.940    graduated seniors who had had quite a        78    00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.460    few cups of commencement punch after        79    00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.850    lunch and it's the two men approached        80    00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.150    each other the younger one thrust out        81    00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.330    his new diploma and he said educated by        82    00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:25.100    God well even with an honorary have a        83    00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.830    doctorate in my hands now I know enough        84    00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.740    not to shout that across the yard but        85    00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.120    the the universities generation        86    00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.639    generosity does make me bold enough to        87    00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.530    to say that over the course of 19 years        88    00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.180    on the Supreme Court I've learned        89    00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.970    something about the Constitution of the        90    00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.510    United States and something about what        91    00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.380    judges do when they apply it in deciding        92    00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.780    constitutional cases and I'm going to        93    00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.580    draw on that experience over the next        94    00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.150    few minutes because it is of course as a        95    00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.419    judge that I have been asked and given        96    00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:07.099    the honor to speak before you the        97    00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.680    occasion for our coming together this        98    00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.610    afternoon        99    00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.639    aligns with the approach of two separate        100    00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.099    events and the judicial side of our        101    00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:20.689    national life one is the course the end        102    00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:22.969    of the approaching end of the Supreme        103    00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:26.030    Court's term with the quickening pace of        104    00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.330    decisions that come down then and the        105    00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.610    other is the the approaching        106    00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.780    confirmation proceedings for a new        107    00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.889    member of the Supreme Court and as a        108    00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:43.819    consequence of both of those impending        109    00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:46.250    events we will be hearing and we will        110    00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.389    probably be discussing a good deal a        111    00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:52.460    certain sort of criticism that is        112    00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.259    frequently aimed at the more        113    00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:58.030    controversial Supreme Court decisions        114    00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.900    we've all heard it        115    00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.300    criticism that the court is making a law        116    00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.409    that the court is announcing        117    00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:08.629    constitutional rules that cannot be        118    00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:12.159    found in the Constitution itself and        119    00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:14.960    that the court is engaging in activism        120    00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.759    to extend civil liberties a good many of        121    00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:22.779    us I'm sure a good many of us hear        122    00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:25.129    intuitively real at and react that this        123    00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:27.259    sort of commentary tends to miss the        124    00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:29.960    monarch but we don't often pause to        125    00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.330    consider in any detail the conceptions        126    00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.449    of the Constitution and of        127    00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:37.699    constitutional judging that underlie        128    00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:41.810    that critical rhetoric any more than we        129    00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.729    can stop to compare them with the        130    00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:46.490    notions that underlie our own intuitive        131    00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:50.360    reactions in this afternoon by way of a        132    00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.669    couple of stories and some lessons to be        133    00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:54.940    drawn from them I'm going to try to make        134    00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:00.860    those comparisons with you the charges        135    00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.479    of lawmaking constitutional novelty seem        136    00:08:05.479 --> 00:08:07.610    to be based on an impression of the        137    00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.550    Constitution and on a sort of template        138    00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.039    for deciding constitutional claims that        139    00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:17.210    go together something like this a claim        140    00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.099    is made in court that the government is        141    00:08:19.099 --> 00:08:21.750    entitled to exercise of power or        142    00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.880    individual is entitled to the benefit of        143    00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.010    some right        144    00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:29.670    in each case set out in the terms of a        145    00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.380    particular provision of the Constitution        146    00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.840    the claimant quotes the provision and        147    00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.849    provides evidence of facts that is said        148    00:08:38.849 --> 00:08:42.110    to prove the entitlement that is claimed        149    00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.210    once those once those facts have been        150    00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:49.140    determined they on their face either do        151    00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.540    or do not support the claim if they do        152    00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.960    the court gives judgment for the party        153    00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.520    who asked for it and if they don't        154    00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.890    judgment goes to the party who contested        155    00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.910    the claim on this view deciding        156    00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.120    constitutional cases should be a        157    00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.250    straightforward exercise of reading        158    00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:13.920    fairly and viewing facts objectively and        159    00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.290    there are of course some constitutional        160    00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.020    cases that would be decided just about        161    00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.970    the way this I will call it the fair        162    00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.450    reading model would have it if one of        163    00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.080    this morning's 21 year old college        164    00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.910    graduates for example claimed a place on        165    00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.790    the ballot for one of the open seats in        166    00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.760    the United States Senate this fall the        167    00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.740    claim could be disposed of simply by        168    00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.010    showing the person's age quoting the        169    00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.050    constitutional provision that a senator        170    00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.220    must be at least 30 years old and        171    00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.660    interpreting that requirement to forbid        172    00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.670    access to the ballot to someone who        173    00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.600    could not qualify to serve if elected no        174    00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.910    one would be apt to claim that lawmaking        175    00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.360    was going on and no one would be likely        176    00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.390    to object that the age requirement did        177    00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.960    not say anything about balance a ballot        178    00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.380    access the theory ting model would        179    00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.000    describe pretty much what would happen        180    00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.330    but cases like this do not usually come        181    00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.330    to court certainly not to the Supreme        182    00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.030    Court of the United States and the ones        183    00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.470    that do get there for the cases that        184    00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.820    tend to raise the national blood        185    00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.120    pressure the fair reading model has only        186    00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.650    a very tenuous connection to reality        187    00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.020    we don't have to think long to show why        188    00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:41.010    it is so unrealistic the Constitution is        189    00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.140    filled with deliberately open-ended        190    00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.420    guarantees like due process and equal        191    00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.120    protection and freedom from unreasonable        192    00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.810    searches and these provisions cannot be        193    00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.880    applied like the requirement for 30 year        194    00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.029    old senators they require more elaborate        195    00:10:57.029 --> 00:10:58.980    reasoning to show why very general        196    00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.170    language applies in some specific cases        197    00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:05.070    but not in others and over time the        198    00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.339    various examples turn into rules rules        199    00:11:08.339 --> 00:11:11.330    that the Constitution does not itself        200    00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.880    specifically mention but this        201    00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.690    explanation hardly scratches the surface        202    00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.700    the reasons that constitutional judging        203    00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.000    is not a mere combination of fair        204    00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.420    reading and simple facts extend way        205    00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.560    beyond the recognition that        206    00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.330    constitutions have a lot of general        207    00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.190    language in them in order to be useful        208    00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:36.900    as constitutions another reason is that        209    00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.450    the Constitution contains values that        210    00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.700    may very well exist in tension with each        211    00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.839    other not in harmony and yet another        212    00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:47.880    reason is that the facts that determine        213    00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.380    whether a constitutional provision        214    00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.440    applies or not may be very different        215    00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.750    from pack the facts like a person's age        216    00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:58.790    or the the amount of the grocery bill        217    00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.380    constitutional facts may require judges        218    00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.930    to understand the meaning that facts        219    00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:06.660    there before the judges can figure out        220    00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.600    what to do about them and this can be        221    00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.410    tricky to show you what I'm getting at I        222    00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.420    picked two examples of what can really        223    00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:21.720    happen to stories of two great cases the        224    00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.400    two stories will not of course give        225    00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.290    anything like a complete description        226    00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.740    either of the Constitution or of judging        227    00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.910    but I think they will show how        228    00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:33.720    unrealistic the fair reading model can        229    00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.800    be the first story is about what the        230    00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.280    Constitution is like it's going to show        231    00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.170    that the Constitution is no simple        232    00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.810    contract not because it uses a certain        233    00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:46.209    amount of        234    00:12:46.209 --> 00:12:47.589    open-ended language that a        235    00:12:47.589 --> 00:12:49.600    constitutional draftsman would hope to        236    00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.529    avoid but because it's language grants        237    00:12:53.529 --> 00:12:56.619    and guarantees many good things and good        238    00:12:56.619 --> 00:12:59.290    things that compete with each other and        239    00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:02.579    could never all be realized all together        240    00:13:02.579 --> 00:13:07.600    all the time the story is about a case        241    00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.809    that many of us here remember it was        242    00:13:10.809 --> 00:13:12.429    argued before the Supreme Court of the        243    00:13:12.429 --> 00:13:17.439    United States on June 26 1971 and we all        244    00:13:17.439 --> 00:13:21.790    know it as the Pentagon Papers the New        245    00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.740    York Times in the Washington Post at        246    00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.689    each obtained copies of classified        247    00:13:25.689 --> 00:13:29.379    documents that had been prepared and        248    00:13:29.379 --> 00:13:30.790    compiled by government officials        249    00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.220    responsible for conducting the Vietnam        250    00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.429    War the newspapers intended to publish        251    00:13:36.429 --> 00:13:39.100    some of those documents and the        252    00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.720    government sought a court order        253    00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.529    forbidding the publication the issue had        254    00:13:44.529 --> 00:13:47.079    been risen in great haste and it        255    00:13:47.079 --> 00:13:48.759    traveled from the trial courts for the        256    00:13:48.759 --> 00:13:50.980    Supreme Court not over the course of        257    00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:55.839    months but in the course of days the        258    00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:57.790    time was one of high passion and the        259    00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:59.980    claim made by the United States was the        260    00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.749    most extreme claim known to the        261    00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:04.029    constitutional doctrines of freedom to        262    00:14:04.029 --> 00:14:07.449    speak and to publish the government said        263    00:14:07.449 --> 00:14:11.319    it was entitled to a prior restraint in        264    00:14:11.319 --> 00:14:13.179    order forbidding publication in the        265    00:14:13.179 --> 00:14:15.459    first place not merely one imposing a        266    00:14:15.459 --> 00:14:17.889    penalty for unlawful publication after        267    00:14:17.889 --> 00:14:21.730    the words are out and the argument in        268    00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.589    that great case included an exchange        269    00:14:23.589 --> 00:14:26.949    between a great lawyer appearing for the        270    00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:30.189    government and a great judge and the        271    00:14:30.189 --> 00:14:31.899    colloquy between them was one of those        272    00:14:31.899 --> 00:14:33.939    instances of a grain of sand that        273    00:14:33.939 --> 00:14:37.869    contains the universe the great lawyer        274    00:14:37.869 --> 00:14:39.610    for the United States was a man who        275    00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:41.410    spent many commencement mornings in this        276    00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:45.730    yard that he was Aaron Griswold Dean of        277    00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.679    the law school for twenty-one years who        278    00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:49.660    was then serving a stand as Solicitor        279    00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:53.860    General of the United States the great        280    00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.589    judge was Mr Justice black the first of        281    00:14:56.589 --> 00:14:58.210    the New Deal justices        282    00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.149    whom justice cardozo described as having        283    00:15:01.149 --> 00:15:03.040    one of the most brilliant legal minds he        284    00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.580    had ever met with the constitutional        285    00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.529    provision on which their exchange sent        286    00:15:08.529 --> 00:15:09.970    it was the First Amendment which        287    00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.640    includes the familiar words that        288    00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.339    Congress shall make no law abridging the        289    00:15:15.339 --> 00:15:19.830    freedom of speech or of the press        290    00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.350    although that language by its literal        291    00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.810    terms were bad Congress from legislating        292    00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.880    to abridge free expression the        293    00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.830    guarantees were understood to bind the        294    00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.660    whole government and to limit what the        295    00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.709    president could ask a court to do as for        296    00:15:35.709 --> 00:15:37.240    the remainder of the provision though        297    00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.010    Justice black professed to read it        298    00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.770    literally when it said there shall be no        299    00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.080    law allowed at Neph note yet left no        300    00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.470    room for any exception the prohibition        301    00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.959    against abridging freedom of speech and        302    00:15:49.959 --> 00:15:55.420    press was absolute in in fairness to him        303    00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.220    one must say that on their face the        304    00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.529    First Amendment clauses seem as clear as        305    00:15:59.529 --> 00:16:01.690    the requirement for 30 year old senators        306    00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:05.410    and one has to say that no guarantee of        307    00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:07.480    the Bill of Rights is more absolute        308    00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.209    informed but that was not the end of the        309    00:16:10.209 --> 00:16:13.180    matter for Dean Griswold notwithstanding        310    00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.370    the language he urged the court to say        311    00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:18.220    that a restraint would be constitutional        312    00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.740    when publication threatened irreparable        313    00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.890    harm the security of the United States        314    00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:25.420    and he contended there was enough in the        315    00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.660    record to show just that he argued that        316    00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.550    the intended publications would threaten        317    00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:33.040    lives and jeopardize the process of        318    00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.690    trying to end the war and recover        319    00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.930    prisoners and would erode the        320    00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.000    government's capacity negotiate with        321    00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.890    foreign governments and through foreign        322    00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:46.900    governments in the future justice black        323    00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.940    responded that if a court could suppress        324    00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.620    publication when the risk to the        325    00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.290    national interest was great enough the        326    00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:58.270    judges would be turned into census Dean        327    00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:00.070    Griswold said he did not know of any        328    00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:04.350    alternative justice black shot back that        329    00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:06.760    respecting the First Amendment might be        330    00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.100    the alternative into that        331    00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.950    Dean Griswold replied in words that I        332    00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:16.930    cannot resist quoting the problem in        333    00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.080    this case he said is the construction of        334    00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.620    the First Amendment        335    00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.960    now Mr Justice your construction of that        336    00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.450    is well known and I certainly respect it        337    00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:32.230    you say that no law means no law and        338    00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:33.820    that should be obvious        339    00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:39.610    I can only say Mr Justice that to me it        340    00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.160    is equally obvious that no law does not        341    00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.440    mean no law and I would seek to persuade        342    00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.370    the court that that is true as Chief        343    00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.130    Justice Marshall said so long ago it is        344    00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:59.890    a constitution we are interpreting the        345    00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:01.540    government lost the case and the        346    00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.390    newspapers published but Dean Griswold        347    00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:08.770    won his argument with justice black to        348    00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.660    show as he put it that no law did not        349    00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.450    mean no law Dean Griswold pointed out        350    00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.130    that the First Amendment was not the        351    00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:18.790    whole Constitution the Constitution also        352    00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:20.710    granted authority to the government to        353    00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.960    provide for the security of the nation        354    00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.660    in authority to the President to manage        355    00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.500    foreign policy in command the military        356    00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.720    and although he failed to convince the        357    00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.370    court that the capacity to exercise        358    00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:36.040    those powers would be seriously affected        359    00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.430    by publication of the papers the Court        360    00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.800    did recognize that at some point the        361    00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.660    authority to govern the Dean Griswold        362    00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.980    invoked could limit the right to publish        363    00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.660    the court did not decide the case on the        364    00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.240    ground that the words no law allowed of        365    00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.520    no exception and meant that the rights        366    00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.970    of expression were absolute the courts        367    00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.830    majority decided only that the        368    00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:01.630    government had not met a high burden of        369    00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.850    showing facts that could justify a prior        370    00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.910    restraint in particular members of the        371    00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:09.100    court spoke of examples that might have        372    00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.720    turned the case around to go the other        373    00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.270    way        374    00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.710    threatened publication of something like        375    00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:17.020    the d-day invasion plans could have been        376    00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:20.320    enjoined justice brennan mentioned a        377    00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.410    publication that would risk a new        378    00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:28.260    Holocaust and peacetime even the First        379    00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.560    Amendment then expressing the value of        380    00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.320    speech and publication terms of a right        381    00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.480    is paramount as any fundamental right        382    00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.810    can be even the First Amendment does not        383    00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:41.640    quite get to the point of an absolute        384    00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.840    guarantee and it fails because the        385    00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.760    Constitution has to be read as a whole        386    00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.180    and when it is other values crop up in        387    00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.100    potential conflict with unfettered        388    00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.820    rights to publish the value of security        389    00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.470    for the nation and the value of the        390    00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.690    president's authority in matters foreign        391    00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:05.850    and military the explicit terms of the        392    00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.460    Constitution in other words can create a        393    00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.550    conflict of approved values and the        394    00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.860    explicit terms of the Constitution do        395    00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:18.050    not resolve that conflict when it arises        396    00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.760    the guarantee of the right to publish is        397    00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.830    unconditional in its terms and in its        398    00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.780    terms the power of the government to        399    00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:30.210    govern is plenary as a consequence a        400    00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.700    choice may have to be made not because        401    00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.620    language is vague but because the        402    00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.710    Constitution embodies the desire of the        403    00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:41.190    American people like most people to have        404    00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:46.050    things both ways we want order and        405    00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:49.890    security and we also want Liberty and we        406    00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:53.100    want not only Liberty but equality as        407    00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:57.450    well and these pairs of desires of ours        408    00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.960    can clash and when they do a court is        409    00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.840    forced to choose between them between        410    00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.180    one constitutional good thing and        411    00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.000    another one        412    00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.100    the court has to decide which of our        413    00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.500    approved desires has the better claim        414    00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:18.240    right here right now and the court has        415    00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.400    to do a lot more than read fairly when        416    00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.320    it makes this kind of choice and choices        417    00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.410    like ones that the justices envisioned        418    00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:32.040    in the papers in the papers case makeup        419    00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.750    of what much of what we mean        420    00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:42.269    let me ask a rhetorical question should        421    00:21:42.269 --> 00:21:44.250    the choice and its explanation in these        422    00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:48.620    cases be called illegitimate lawmaking        423    00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:52.049    can it be an act beyond the judicial        424    00:21:52.049 --> 00:21:54.120    power when a choice must be made and the        425    00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.159    Constitution has not made it in advance        426    00:21:56.159 --> 00:22:03.110    in so many words well you know my answer        427    00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:07.169    so much for the notion that all of        428    00:22:07.169 --> 00:22:09.330    constitutional law lies there in the        429    00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.279    Constitution and waiting for a judge to        430    00:22:11.279 --> 00:22:17.220    read it fairly now let me tell a second        431    00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.070    story not one illustrating the tensions        432    00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:21.830    within the Constitution or within        433    00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:25.260    constitutional law but one showing the        434    00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:29.179    the subtlety of constitutional facts        435    00:22:29.179 --> 00:22:31.830    again the story is about a famous case        436    00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:35.250    and still a good many of us here        437    00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.440    remember this one too because it was        438    00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.429    brown v board of education in 1954 the        439    00:22:41.429 --> 00:22:42.929    case in which the Supreme Court        440    00:22:42.929 --> 00:22:44.789    unanimously held that racial segregation        441    00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:48.870    in public schools imposed by law was        442    00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:51.570    unconstitutional as violating the        443    00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:55.130    guarantee of equal protection of the law        444    00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:58.169    Brown ended the era of separate but        445    00:22:58.169 --> 00:23:01.399    equal whose paradigm was the decision in        446    00:23:01.399 --> 00:23:03.809    1896 of the case called Plessy and        447    00:23:03.809 --> 00:23:07.470    Ferguson and in that case the Supreme        448    00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:09.690    Court had held it was no violation of        449    00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.990    equal protection to require black people        450    00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.450    to ride in a separate railroad car that        451    00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:17.970    was physically equal to the car for        452    00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:22.049    whites one argument that had been        453    00:23:22.049 --> 00:23:24.389    offered in Plessy was that separate the        454    00:23:24.389 --> 00:23:26.250    separate black car was a badge of        455    00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:30.690    inferiority and to that the court        456    00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.970    majority responded at the time that if        457    00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.639    black people viewed it that way the        458    00:23:35.639 --> 00:23:37.740    implication was merely a product of        459    00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:42.899    their own minds 60 years later Brown        460    00:23:42.899 --> 00:23:45.149    held that a segregated school required        461    00:23:45.149 --> 00:23:46.510    for black children        462    00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:52.990    was inherently unequal for those whose        463    00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.090    exclusive norm of constitutional judging        464    00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:58.760    is merely fair reading of language        465    00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.180    applied to facts objectively viewed        466    00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.340    Brown must be either flat-out wrong or a        467    00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.870    very mystifying decision those who tend        468    00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:10.820    to look to that model are unlikely to        469    00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.610    think that a federal court back in 1896        470    00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:15.140    should have declared legally mandated        471    00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.530    rate of racial segregation        472    00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:21.350    unconstitutional but if Plessy was not        473    00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:23.600    wrong how is it that Brown came out so        474    00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.110    differently the language of the        475    00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.970    Constitution's guarantee of equal        476    00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.830    protection of the laws did not change        477    00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:35.810    between 1896 and 1954 and it would be        478    00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:37.880    very hard to say that the obvious facts        479    00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:42.580    on which Plessy was based had changed        480    00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.680    while Plessy was about railroad cars and        481    00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.900    Brown was about schools and school rooms        482    00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:52.210    that distinction was no great difference        483    00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.590    and actually the best clue to the        484    00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:56.330    difference between the cases is the        485    00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.880    dates they were decided which I think        486    00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.730    lead to the explanation for their        487    00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:05.720    divergent results as I have said        488    00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.730    elsewhere the members of the court in        489    00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.300    the Plessy case remembered the day when        490    00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.240    human slavery was the law in much of the        491    00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:18.560    land to that generation the formal        492    00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.660    equality of an identical railroad car        493    00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:28.010    meant enormous progress but the        494    00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.730    generation in power in 1954 looked at        495    00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.470    enforced separation without the        496    00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.570    revolting background as slavery to make        497    00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:40.070    it look unexceptional by contrast as a        498    00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:43.220    consequence the judges in 1954 found a        499    00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:47.300    meaning in segregation that the majority        500    00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.660    of their predecessors in 1896 simply did        501    00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:54.770    not see that meaning is not captured by        502    00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:56.450    descriptions of physically identical        503    00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:57.740    schools        504    00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.020    physically physically identical railroad        505    00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.559    cars the meaning of facts arises        506    00:26:03.559 --> 00:26:05.780    elsewhere and its judicial perception        507    00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.910    turns on the experience of the judges        508    00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:11.210    and on their ability to think from a        509    00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:12.950    point of view that is different from        510    00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:17.570    their own meaning comes from the        511    00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:19.910    capacity to see what is not in some        512    00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:23.660    simple objective sense there on a        513    00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:28.429    printed page and when the judges of 1954        514    00:26:28.429 --> 00:26:29.990    read the record of enforced segregation        515    00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:32.750    it carried only one possible meaning to        516    00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:36.170    them it expressed a judgment of inherent        517    00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:38.450    fury already on the part of the minority        518    00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:44.000    race and the judges who understood the        519    00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.820    meaning that was apparent in 1954 would        520    00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.740    have violated their oath to uphold the        521    00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.650    Constitution if they had not held the        522    00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:55.240    segregation mandate unconstitutional        523    00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:01.760    again a rhetorical question did the        524    00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.000    judges of 1954 cross some limit of        525    00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.580    legitimacy into lawmaking by stating a        526    00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.160    constitution that a conclusion that you        527    00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.809    will not find written in the        528    00:27:11.809 --> 00:27:17.900    Constitution was it activism to act        529    00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.570    based on the current meaning of facts        530    00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:23.270    that at a purely objective level were        531    00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.090    about the same as plessy's facts 60        532    00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:31.610    years before again of course you know my        533    00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:34.670    answer and so much for the assumption        534    00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:37.160    that facts just lie there waiting for an        535    00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:43.130    objective judge to view them so let me        536    00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:47.240    like the like the lawyer I am sum up the        537    00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.920    case I've tried to present this        538    00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:53.780    afternoon the fair reading model fails        539    00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.760    to account for what the Constitution        540    00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.090    actually says and it fails just as badly        541    00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:01.400    to understand what judges have no choice        542    00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:06.200    but to do the Constitution is a pantheon        543    00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.690    of values and a lot of hard cases are        544    00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:10.310    hard because the constant        545    00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:12.910    Dushan gives no simple rule of decision        546    00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:15.770    for the cases in which one of the values        547    00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:20.660    is truly at odds with another not even        548    00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.370    its most uncompromising and        549    00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:24.710    unconditional language can resolve every        550    00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:27.980    potential tension of one provision with        551    00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.740    another provision attention that the        552    00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.780    Constitution's framers left to be        553    00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:36.080    resolved another day and another day        554    00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.740    after that for our cases can give no        555    00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:43.130    answers that fit all conflicts and no        556    00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:44.720    resolutions that are immune to        557    00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.640    rethinking when the significance of old        558    00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.850    facts have changed with the changing        559    00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:53.690    world and these are reasons enough to        560    00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:55.970    show how egregiously it misses the point        561    00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:58.190    to think of judges in constitutional        562    00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:00.730    cases is just sitting there reading        563    00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:03.140    constitutional phrases fairly and        564    00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.600    looking at reported facts objectively to        565    00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:10.400    produce their judgments judges have to        566    00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.740    choose between the good things that the        567    00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:15.460    Constitution approves and when they do        568    00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.140    they have to choose not on the basis of        569    00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:22.580    measurements but of meanings the fair        570    00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:26.600    reading model misses that but it misses        571    00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:31.400    even more remember that the tensions        572    00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.830    that are the stuff of judging in so many        573    00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:37.040    hard constitutional cases are after all        574    00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:42.370    creatures of our aspirations aspirations        575    00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:47.870    to Liberty as well as to order and to        576    00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.660    fairness and equality as well as to        577    00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:55.370    liberty and the very opportunity for        578    00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:57.950    conflict between one high value and        579    00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:01.190    another reflects our confidence that a        580    00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:03.110    way may be found to resolve it when a        581    00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:06.740    conflict arises that is why the        582    00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.900    simplistic view of the Constitution        583    00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:13.040    devalues our aspirations and it attacks        584    00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:18.260    our confidence and it diminishes us it        585    00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.600    is a view of judging that means to        586    00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:24.000    discourage our tenacity including        587    00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.610    I sometimes reluctant tenacity to keep        588    00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.860    the constitutional promises the nation        589    00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:36.090    has been made so it is tempting it is        590    00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:38.040    tempting to dismiss the critical record        591    00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.310    of record rhetoric of lawmaking and        592    00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:45.390    activism it's simply a rejection of too        593    00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:48.000    many of the hopes we profess to share as        594    00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.810    the American people but there is one        595    00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:59.040    thing more I have to believe that        596    00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.130    something deeper is involved and that        597    00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:05.190    behind most of the dreams of a simpler        598    00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.620    Constitution there lies a basic human        599    00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:11.190    hunger for the certainty and control the        600    00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:15.120    fair reading model seems to promise and        601    00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:20.670    who has not felt that same hunger is        602    00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:22.440    there anyone of us who has not lived        603    00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:26.100    through moments and perhaps years of        604    00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.900    longing for a world without any        605    00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:33.260    ambiguity for the stability of something        606    00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:39.050    unchangeable in human institutions I        607    00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:44.010    don't forget my own longing the longing        608    00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:46.140    for certainty that resisted the        609    00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.840    pronouncement of Justice Holmes which I        610    00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.950    read as an undergraduate the certainty        611    00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:55.440    generally is illusion and repose is not        612    00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.620    our destiny but I have come to        613    00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:02.040    understand that he was right and by the        614    00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.050    same token I understand that I differ        615    00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:06.420    from the critics I've described not        616    00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.670    merely in seeing the patent wisdom of        617    00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:12.750    brown or in espousing the rule excluding        618    00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:16.410    unlawfully seized evidence or in        619    00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:19.490    understanding the scope of habeas corpus        620    00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:21.990    where I suspect we differ most        621    00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:25.860    fundamentally is in my belief that in an        622    00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.620    indeterminate world I cannot control it        623    00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:32.580    is still possible to live fully in the        624    00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.620    trust that away will be found leading        625    00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.630    through the future        626    00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:40.919    uncertain as it is and to me the future        627    00:32:40.919 --> 00:32:42.720    of the Constitution is the framers wrote        628    00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.029    it can be staked only upon that same        629    00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:49.409    trust if we cannot share every        630    00:32:49.409 --> 00:32:51.269    intellectual assumption that formed the        631    00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:55.019    minds of those who framed the Charter we        632    00:32:55.019 --> 00:32:56.779    can still address the constitutional        633    00:32:56.779 --> 00:32:59.519    uncertainties the way they must have        634    00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:05.190    envisioned by relying on reason by        635    00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:07.830    respecting all the words the frame is        636    00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:13.620    wrote by facing facts and by seeking to        637    00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:17.360    understand the meaning of those facts        638    00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:23.639    for living people that is how a judge        639    00:33:23.639 --> 00:33:27.600    lives in a state of trust and I know of        640    00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.610    no other way to make good on the        641    00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:33.590    aspirations that tell us who we are and        642    00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:37.350    who we mean to be as the people of the        643    00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:39.799    United States        644    00:34:20.500 -->

   00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.829    great pleasure to be with you here today        2    00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.279    and to deliver this year's report of the        3    00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.599    president to the Alumni my role in this        4    00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.880    gathering each spring seems to be to        5    00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.120    delay the main event the address you are        6    00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.490    all waiting for from our distinguished        7    00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.880    honor and it is a great honor to serve        8    00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.220    as justice suitors warm-up act I intend        9    00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.619    to do so by exploring with you for the        10    00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.650    next few minutes a set of long held        11    00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.800    values and commitments to which we at        12    00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.930    Harvard have devoted particular        13    00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.050    attention this year these commitments        14    00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.140    are in fact those that justice suitors        15    00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.039    life and accomplishments exemplify and I        16    00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.309    am proud to claim and honor him as an        17    00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.649    embodiment of these fundamental        18    00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.660    University values I speak of course of        19    00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.940    Harvard's long tradition of public        20    00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.809    service going back to our 17th century        21    00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.430    roots the university's founders        22    00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.729    described the arc of education as one        23    00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.700    that moves from self development to        24    00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.600    public action John cotton a prominent        25    00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.020    figure in Harvard's founding wrote God        26    00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.890    would have a man's best gifts improved        27    00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.340    to the best advantage but then he        28    00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.040    continued the student would also see        29    00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.640    that his calling should tend to public        30    00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.810    good this prescription articulated        31    00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.409    nearly four centuries ago captures with        32    00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.590    remarkable fidelity a fundamental        33    00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.979    purpose of the modern research        34    00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.850    university the development of talent in        35    00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.700    service of a better world this        36    00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.850    commitment is at the heart of all we do        37    00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.420    and at the heart of what we celebrate        38    00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.140    today as we mark the passage of more        39    00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.220    than 6,000 graduates from our precincts        40    00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.290    into wider realms        41    00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.739    of challenge and achievement we have        42    00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.780    equipped them we trust with the        43    00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.299    abilities in the words of Charles        44    00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.180    William Elliot to go forth to serve        45    00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.230    better thy country and my kind we hope        46    00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.230    that we have equipped them as well with        47    00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.650    the capacity to lead fulfilled        48    00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.359    meaningful and successful lives yet not        49    00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.810    infrequently these missions of private        50    00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.689    accomplishment and public duty have been        51    00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:49.650    seen in tension phillips brooks for whom        52    00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.049    phillips brooks house for social service        53    00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.269    is named and this is a place where        54    00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.870    justice Souter spent time as an        55    00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.540    undergraduate phillips brooks once        56    00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.019    remarked we debate whether self cut        57    00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.639    culture or our brethren service is the        58    00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.359    true purpose of our life but he        59    00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.989    determined the two must coexist in a        60    00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.290    creative balance in which we develop our        61    00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.639    talents in order to share them Brooks        62    00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.489    concluded that while as he put it no man        63    00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.599    can come to his best by selfishness no        64    00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.299    man can do much for other men who is not        65    00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.609    much himself in the mid 20th century        66    00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.409    John F Kennedy worried about the        67    00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.739    potential conflict between in his words        68    00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.989    the public interest and private comfort        69    00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.479    our students still struggle with these        70    00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:55.560    choices today to college seniors who        71    00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.669    have decided to join Teach for America        72    00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.470    recounted to me how hard it was to        73    00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.199    explain to their parents that they were        74    00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:09.079    turning down offers at JP Morgan and IBM        75    00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.419    yesterday I attended the commissioning        76    00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:16.409    of rotc cadets who are likely to find        77    00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.209    themselves soon serving the public        78    00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.090    interest in the considerable discomfort        79    00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.409    and danger of the war zones of        80    00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:25.740    Afghanistan        81    00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.300    and Iraq for these students however        82    00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.990    service represents not sacrifice but the        83    00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.530    most important form of fulfillment in        84    00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.210    which one's talents can be harnessed for        85    00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.210    purposes transcending one's own        86    00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.289

00:05:03.870    possibly the hardest thing I've ever had        92    00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.960    to do in my life but by far the most        93    00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.229    rewarding at the end of every day I        94    00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.500    might leave work mentally emotionally        95    00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.009    and physically exhausted but it is the        96    00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.520    best type of exhaustion and well worth        97    00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.620    the impact of closing the achievement        98    00:05:22.620 -->

bring the world's best        101    00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.909    minds to the world's biggest problems we        102    00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:42.090    do that on the one hand through direct        103    00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.599    engagement in service like that of AJ        104    00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:50.039    Garcia but universities their faculty        105    00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.729    their students play another important        106    00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:56.639    role in contributing to the public good        107    00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.819    and that is through engaging those        108    00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:02.430    remarkable minds in discovering        109    00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.840    solutions to those biggest problems        110    00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.550    solutions that will close the        111    00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.860    achievement gap so we don't have to        112    00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.729    address it one child at a time solutions        113    00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:16.520    that will help deliver health care        114    00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.069    address climate change resolve ethnic

12    00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.680    which will become increasingly more        13    00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.960    evident as i proceed        14    00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.840    i'm a comedian by profession and i        15    00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.600    started performing here in the boston        16    00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.000    area        17    00:00:44.000 -->

   00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.640    i've traveled all over the world        21    00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.640    performing stand-up comedy        22    00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.760    i don't want to brag but two years ago i        23    00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.840    performed in europe        24    00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.520    and i'd just like to say excellent        25    00:01:10.840

in cambridge we lived        31    00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.680    right near a college        32    00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.040    my father owned and drove taxi cabs here        33    00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.560    in harvard square he would pick up        34    00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.680    harvard professors        35    00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.799    they would tell them things        36    00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.560    he would come home and tell us        37    00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.200    for generations harvard has given        38    00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.840    scholarships to students from cambridge        39    00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.680    and students from all over the world        40    00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.399    who could meet the academic requirements        41    00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.399    starting in the third grade my dear        42    00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.159    sweet mother who was here this morning        43    00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.079    would say to me jimmy        44    00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.759    if you study really hard someday you        45    00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.800    could go to harvard        46    00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.959    by the sixth grade she stopped telling        47    00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.280    me that        48    00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.360    by the eighth grade our whole        49    00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.959    neighborhood had their eyes set on        50    00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.160    harvard        51    00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.560    not so much for scholarships but because        52    00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.080    it was an excellent place        53    00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.319    to steal bicycles        54    00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.800    i can remember running through this very        55    00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.280    yard        56    00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.800    some 40 years ago being

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.519    students in the administration        63    00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.800    over civil rights in the war in vietnam        64    00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.440    but

78    00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.440    i was a catholic i should have been        79    00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.840    praying before i tried to take the        80    00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.360    bicycle        81    00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.680    and i just want to say to the alumni        82    00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.440    gathered here this morning        83    00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.080    on behalf of myself and all the other        84    00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.360    misguided youth        85    00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.480    of cambridge and greater boston who may        86    00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.640    have unjustified        87    00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.400    taken your bicycles        88    00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.120    we're sorry        89    00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.480    and to the graduates many of you will go        90    00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.400    on to positions of great power        91    00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.720    and influence in business and politics        92    00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.840    and government        93    00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.479    and the temptations to cut corners to        94    00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.880    lie        95    00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.720    to steal to cheat will be formidable        96    00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.160    my advice to you today is simply this        97    00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.800    ask for guidance before you commit the        98    00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.199    crime        99    00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.080    trust me it is much less embarrassing to        100    00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.680    ask for help privately        101    00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.840    than to beg for forgiveness at        102    00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.840    graduation        103    00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.479    and i am so grateful i am so grateful        104    00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.800    that the petty crimes of my youth were        105    00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.479    not successful        106    00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.960    for had my dishonest behavior been        107    00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.000    rewarded        108    00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.360    i may not be with you here today my life        109    00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.560    may have taken        110    00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.120    a different turn and i could have ended        111    00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.600    up        112    00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:11.840    on wall street        113

here to        30    00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.520    share a few thoughts about the world        31    00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.220    that you are going to graduate into now        32    00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.009    my mandate is to be humorous and also to        33    00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.920    be stimulating jokes I have to tell you        34    00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.080    are not my forte but I am going to        35    00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.509    soldier on for a few seconds to try to        36    00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.409    get one out at an event a few months ago        37    00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.659    a few weeks ago I heard a joke and I        38    00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.280    managed to remember it which is why I'm        39    00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.080    going to deliver it here right now and        40    00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.080    it goes something like this        41    00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.959    Senator John Warner who among many        42    00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:56.659    distinctions was the seventh husband of        43    00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.799    the actress Elizabeth Taylor stood in        44    00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.069    their suite on the night of their        45    00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.759    wedding and a growing panic rose through        46    00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.090    his body he said to himself he thought        47    00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.940    to himself I know what I meant to be        48    00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.670    doing here night next I just have to        49    00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.780    figure out a way to make it interesting        50    00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.430    which is a little bit of the dilemma I        51    00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.110    find myself in right now so let me start        52    00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.510    by saying and acknowledging the        53    00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.069    difficult world that you do graduate        54    00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.800    into I do feel sorry when I read coming        55    00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.870    up to here in the weeks and days that        56    00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.390    have preceded this class day exercises        57    00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.879    in your commencement the well term of        58    00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.360    welcome or unwelcome advice about the        59    00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.550    situation that you're graduating into I        60    00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.340    don't think it's all hard and difficult        61    00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.340    and bad news out there I think yes it is        62    00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.409    difficult but there are incredible        63    00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.620    opportunities amongst all the challenges        64    00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.569    that you know so well and that you're        65    00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.819    about to face and I would also like to        66    00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.340    say to all of you who are mourning        67    00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.849    leaving Harvard        68    00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.310    it is like leaving a family after four        69    00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.870    years it's like leaving your comfort        70    00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.900    zone but it is only just beginning there        71    00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.610    will be so many more        72    00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.860    is to crash so many more families to        73    00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.890    join so much more fun to be had and so        74    00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.530    many opportunities to think to push        75    00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.050    yourself and to be on the cutting edge        76    00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.660    of your future and the future of your        77    00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.720    communities and your world I want to        78    00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.340    tell you that whatever talent it is that        79    00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.550    you have all of you who can I hope you        80    00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.709    would take this moment to think about        81    00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.830    traveling around the world I hope that        82    00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.480    you will either get your passports or        83    00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.670    renew your passports and think about        84    00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.980    taking this moment to perhaps take a gap        85    00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.739    year or a gap period of time to go out        86    00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.230    not just to see the world but to launch        87    00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.209    all your talents your interest your        88    00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.030    fervor your youth in the service and in

  00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.690    that you would take the time also to        125    00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.280    learn the language of whatever country        126    00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.919    you happen to end up in to learn the        127    00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.379    culture to learn the politics you know I        128    00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:34.300    was just at the king chart exhibition        129    00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.840    with my son in in New York and I learned        130    00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.960    there that the preeminent translator of        131    00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.870    hieroglyphics into a known language was        132    00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.819    an American Charles Wilber the        133    00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:49.810    preeminent students and professors of so        134    00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.270    much that we now know about have been        135    00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.919    Americans and Americans who have        136    00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.050    traveled and put their unique talents        137    00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.569    and abilities to work on behalf of        138    00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:01.479    people overseas and in turn people here        139    00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.319    as I said travel and work abroad will        140    00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:07.360    stand you in good stead and shape your        141    00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.419    futures I know it's risky and many of        142    00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:11.979    your parents will think I'm crazy for        143    00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:13.870    saying this kind of thing at this moment        144    00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.750    but I want you to just do it because we        145    00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.690    live in a globalized world everything        146    00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.060    not just business but health education        147    00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.460    everything we think about now has        148    00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.650    international tentacles and        149    00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.860    ramifications you will never again this        150    00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.259    generation and future generations will        151    00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:34.030    never again have the luxury of just        152    00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.259    looking inwards if my tamai amazed you        153    00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:40.270    to know that many great American        154    00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.849    universities have opened campuses in the        155    00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:44.830    Middle East in Asia and in many other        156    00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.500    places around the world there are some 3        157    00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.110    million students around the world who        158    00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.080    attend colleges and attend campuses that        159

00:07:00.669    of the most inspiring and important        162    00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:02.380    messages of the 20th century was        163    00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.069    delivered here on commencement day in        164    00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:08.380    1947 by General and Secretary of State        165    00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.710    George C Marshall it was two years after        166    00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.319    the defeat of Nazi Germany and he had        167    00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:16.599    just returned from Europe to report to        168    00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:19.000    his government of a Europe that still        169    00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.699    lay in ruins he said that its survival        170    00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:23.529    was still at stake that its people were        171    00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:26.199    facing shortages of everything not just        172    00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:28.570    food but housing and didn't even have        173    00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.430    the money to pay for the imports that        174    00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.650    they needed to get        175    00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.560    on their way so he used his Harvard        176    00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.660    address to propose a massive        177    00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.639    pan-european and US economic recovery        178    00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:43.590    plan and what became known as you all        179    00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.539    know as the Marshall Plan and indeed has        180    00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:48.270    just been celebrated again in Paris this        181    00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.820    week as the u.s. unveiled the building        182    00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.740    right in the heart of Paris that was        183    00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.169    used as the European headquarters of the        184    00:07:55.169 --> 00:07:57.690    marshall plan to rebuild Europe and it        185    00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.610    wasn't just for Europe sake but it was        186    00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:01.830    also for the sake of a stable and        187    00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.190    peaceful future for America and        188    00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.810    generations who've come one that would        189    00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.660    only be achieved by long-term US        190    00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.669    commitment and he used his address here        191    00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:14.910    to galvanize US leadership and he said        192    00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.820    that it needed not just piecemeal action        193    00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.370    but that any US assistance in the future        194    00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.910    quote should provide a cure rather than        195    00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.789    a mere palliative America's challenges        196    00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:29.250    remain the same today helping to        197    00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.680    stabilize anywhere from Afghanistan Iraq        198    00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.310    Yemen Haiti Pakistan all the countries

security as well and        204    00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.790    beyond the armies and the treasure that        205    00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.620    the United States is deploying and        206    00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.839    spending in these places they need        207    00:08:54.839 --> 00:08:57.060    armies of people like you who are        208    00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.970

      7    00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.000    gentlemen when I was younger I I used to        8    00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.920    hear Harvard stories from a member of        9    00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.439    the class of        10    00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.000    1885 uh back uh back then uh old        11    00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.680    graduates of the college who could get        12    00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.320    to Cambridge on commencement day didn't        13    00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.200    wait for reunion years uh to come back        14    00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.520    they just turn up see their old friends        15    00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.440    look at the new crop and drink some        16    00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.480    commencement punch under the        17    00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.920    Elms and the old man remembered one of        18    00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.160    those summer days when he was heading        19    00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.359    for the square after lunch and he        20    00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.039    crossed paths with one of the newly        21    00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.039    graduated seniors who had had quite a        22    00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.799    few cups of commencement punch after        23    00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.759    lunch and as the two men approached each        24    00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.920    other the younger one thrust out his new        25    00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.640    diploma and he said educated by        26    00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.400    God well even with a an honorary hav        27    00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.960    doctorate in my hands now I know enough        28    00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.640    not to shout that across the yard but        29    00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.479    the the University's generation        30    00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.520    generosity does make me bold enough to        31    00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.600    to say that over the course of 19 years        32    00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.000    on the Supreme Court I learned something        33    00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.600    about the Constitution of the United        34    00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.040    States and        35    00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.799    something about what judges do when they        36    00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.320    apply it in deciding constitutional        37    00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.600    cases and I'm going to draw on that        38    00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.960    experience over the next few minutes        39    00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.640    because it is of course as a judge that        40    00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.200    I have been asked and given the honor to        41    00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.840    speak before you        42    00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.439    you the occasion for our coming together        43    00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.759    uh this afternoon aligns with the        44    00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.479    approach of two separate events in the        45    00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.599    judicial side of of our national        46    00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.480    life one is the U of course the end of        47    00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.120    the approaching end of the Supreme        48    00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.120    Court's term with the quickening pace of        49    00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.120    decisions that come down        50    00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.319    then and the other is the        51    00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.760    uh uh the uh approaching confirmation        52    00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.720    proceedings for a new member of the        53    00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.680    Supreme        54    00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.319    Court and as a consequence of both of        55    00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.080    those impending events we will be        56    00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.560    hearing and we will probably be        57    00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.000    discussing a good        58    00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.599    deal a certain sort of criticism that is        59    00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.480    frequently aimed at the more        60    00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.920    controversial Supreme Court        61    00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.959    decisions we've all heard it criticism        62    00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.239    that the court is making up law        63    00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.680    that the court is announcing        64    00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.760    constitutional rules that cannot be        65    00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.920    found in the Constitution        66    00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.640    itself and that the court is engaging in        67    00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.200    activism to extend civil        68    00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.280    liberties a good many of us I'm sure a        69    00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.440    good many of us here intuitively Rea        70    00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.799    react that this sort of commentary tends        71    00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.519    to miss the mark but we don't often        72    00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.840    pause to consider in any detail the        73    00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.400    conceptions of the con Constitution and        74    00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.280    of constitutional judging that underly        75    00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.120    that critical        76    00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.959    rhetoric any more than we can stop to        77    00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.239    compare them with the Notions that        78    00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.480    underly our own intuitive        79    00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.480    reactions and this afternoon by way of a        80    00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.799    couple of stories and some lessons to be        81    00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.879    drawn from them I'm going to try to make        82    00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.400    those comparisons with        83    00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.560    you the charges of lawmaking        84    00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.280    constitutional know        85    00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.560    Noy seem to be based on an impression of        86    00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.200    the Constitution and on a a sort of        87    00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.439    template for deciding constitutional        88    00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:11.840    claims that go together something like        89    00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.560    this a claim is made in court that the        90    00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.680    government is entitled to exercise a        91    00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.400    power or or an individual is entitled to        92    00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.959    the benefit of some        93    00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.479    right in each case set out in the terms        94    00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.720    of a particular provision of the        95    00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.280    Constitution        96    00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.919    the claimant quotes the provision and        97    00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.919    provides evidence of facts that is said        98    00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.000    to prove the entitlement that is        99    00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.240    claimed once those once those facts have        100    00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.680    been        101    00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.440    determined they on their face either do        102    00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.960    or do not support the claim if they do        103    00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.039    the Court gives judgment for the party        104    00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:52.720    who asks for it and if they don't        105    00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.960    judgment goes to the party who contested        106    00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.039    the        107    00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.000    claim on this view deciding Constitution        108    00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.840    cases should be a straightforward        109    00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.199    exercise of reading        110    00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.320    fairly and viewing facts        111    00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.880    objectively and there are of course some        112    00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.759    constitutional cases that would be        113    00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.360    decided just about the way this I'll        114    00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.120    call it the fair reading model would        115    00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.919    have        116    00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.680    it if one of this morning's 21-year-old        117    00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.360    uh college graduates for example claim        118    00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.919    to place on the ballot for one of the        119    00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.160    open seats in the United States Senate        120    00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.280    this fall the claim could be disposed of        121    00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.560    Simply by showing the person's age        122    00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.440    quoting the Constitutional provision        123    00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.440    that a senator must be at least 30 years        124    00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.360    old and interpreting that requirement to        125    00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.600    forbid access to the ballot to someone        126    00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.479    who could not qualify to serve if        127    00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:52.080    elected no one would be apt to claim        128    00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.440    that lawmaking was going        129    00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.160    on and no one would be likely to object        130    00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.639    that the age requirement did not not say        131    00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.240    anything about ballot ballot        132    00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.479    access the fear reading model would        133    00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.479    describe pretty much what would happen        134    00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:11.360    but cases like this do not usually come        135    00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.440    to court certainly not to the Supreme        136    00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.240    Court of the United States and the ones        137    00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.240    that do get there for the cases that        138    00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.400    tend to raise the national blood        139    00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.280    pressure the fair reading model has only        140    00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.560    a very tenuous connection to reality        141    00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.160    we don't have to think long to show why        142    00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.360    it is so        143    00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.120    unrealistic the Constitution uh is        144    00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.280    filled with deliberately open-ended        145    00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.199    guarantees like due process and equal        146    00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:45.360    protection and freedom from unreasonable        147    00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.919    searches and these Provisions cannot be        148    00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:49.479    applied like the requirement for        149    00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:50.800    30-year-old        150    00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.120    Senators they require more elaborate        151    00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.039    reasoning to show why very general        152    00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.560    language applies in some specific cases        153    00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.199    but not in others and over time the        154    00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:04.639    various examples turn into rules rules        155    00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:06.800    that the constitution does not        156    00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.599    itself specifically        157    00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:12.199    mentioned but this explanation hardly        158    00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:13.639    scratches the        159    00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:16.319    surface the reasons that constitutional        160    00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:18.560    judging is not a mere        161    00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.840    combination of fair reading and simple        162    00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.599    facts extend Way Beyond the recognition        163    00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:26.479    that constitutions have a lot of General        164    00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:28.680    language in them in order to be useful        165    00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.680    as Constitution        166    00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.479    ions another reason is that the        167    00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:35.879    Constitution contains values that may        168    00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:38.080    very well exist in tension with each        169    00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.319    other not in        170    00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:42.759    Harmony and yet another reason is that        171    00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:44.440    the facts that determine whether a        172    00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.599    constitutional provision applies or not        173    00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:49.800    may be very different from fact facts        174    00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.960    like a person's age or the the amount of        175    00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.280    the grocery bill constitutional facts        176    00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.000    may require judges to understand the        177    00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.800    meaning that facts bear before the        178    00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.039    judges can figure out what to do about        179    00:08:04.039 --> 00:08:06.919    them and this can be        180    00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:09.599    tricky to show you what I'm getting at I        181    00:08:09.599 --> 00:08:12.560    picked two examples of what can really        182    00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.639    happen two stories of two great        183    00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:19.319    cases the two stories will not of course        184    00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:21.080    give anything like a complete        185    00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.800    description either of the Constitution        186    00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.639    or of        187    00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:26.879    judging but I think they will show how        188    00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:31.200    unrealistic the fear reading model can        189    00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.959    be the first story is about what the        190    00:08:33.959 --> 00:08:35.680    Constitution is        191    00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.880    like it's going to show that the        192    00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.640    constitution is no simple contract not        193    00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.279    because it uses a certain amount of        194    00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:43.800    open-ended language that a        195    00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.959    constitutional draftsman would hope to        196    00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:49.560    avoid but because its language grants        197    00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.600    and guarantees many good things and good        198    00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.800    things that compete with each other and        199    00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.760    can never all be realized Al together        200    00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.560    all the        201    00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.160    time the story is about a case that many        202    00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.600    of us here        203    00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.760    remember it was argued before The        204    00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.720    Supreme Court of the United States on        205    00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.040    June 26        206    00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.600    1971 and we all know it as the Pentagon        207    00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.720    papers the New York Times And The        208    00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.920    Washington Post Had Each obtained copies        209    00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.720    of classified documents that had been        210    00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.800    prepared and compiled by government        211    00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.800    officials responsible for conducting the        212    00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.880    Vietnam        213    00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.680    War the newspapers intended to publish        214    00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.120    some of those documents and the        215    00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.760    government sought a court order        216    00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.959    forbidding the        217    00:09:38.959 --> 00:09:41.360    publication the issue had Arisen in        218    00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.880    great haste and had traveled from the        219    00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.240    trial courts to the Supreme Court not        220    00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.800    over the course of months but in the        221    00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.760    course of        222    00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.560    days the time was one of high passion        223    00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.720    and the claim made by the United States        224    00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.880    was the most extreme claim known to the        225    00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.760    Constitutional doctrines of freedom

   00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.520    those who tend to look to that model        2    00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.200    are unlikely to think that a federal        3    00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.000    court back in 1896 should have declared        4    00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.519    legally mandated        5    00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.679    racial segregation unconstitutional        6    00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.759    but if plessy was not wrong how is it        7    00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.520    that brown came out so differently        8    00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.359    the language of the constitution's        9    00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.199    guarantee of equal protection of the        10    00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.199    laws did not change between 1896 and        11    00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.640    1954        12    00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.320    and it would be very hard to say that        13    00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.559    the obvious facts on which plessy        14    00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.719    was based had changed        15    00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.040    while plessy was about railroad cars and        16    00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.920    brown was about schools and school rooms        17    00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.840    that distinction was no great difference        18    00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.000    and actually the best clue the        19    00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.680    difference between the cases is the        20    00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.600    dates they were decided        21    00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.680    which i think lead to the explanation        22    00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.879    for        23    00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.399    their divergent results        24    00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.320    as i have said elsewhere the members of        25    00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.520    the court in the plessy case        26    00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.920    remembered the day when human slavery        27    00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.960    was the law        28    00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.360    in much of the land to that generation        29    00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.720    the formal equality of an identical        30    00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.880    railroad car        31    00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.320    meant enormous progress        32    00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.720    but the generation in power in 1954        33    00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.640    looked at in fourth separation without        34    00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.799    the revolting background of slavery to        35    00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:29.680    make it look        36    00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.280    unexceptional by contrast        37    00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.240    as a consequence the judges in 1954        38    00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.360    found a meaning        39    00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.040    in segregation that the majority of        40    00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.079    their predecessors in 1896 simply did        41    00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.640    not see        42    00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.320    that meaning is not captured by        43    00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.399    descriptions of physically identical        44    00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.680    schools or physical        45    00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.439    physically identical railroad cars        46    00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.600    the meeting of facts arises elsewhere        47    00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.920    and its judicial perception turns on the        48    00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.159    experience of the judges        49    00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.640    and on their ability to think from a        50    00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.399    point of view that is different from        51    00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.679    their own        52    00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.080    meaning comes from the capacity to see        53    00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.879    what is not        54    00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.239    in some simple objective sense        55    00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.760    there on a printed page        56    00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.239    and when the judges of 1954 read the        57    00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.000    record of enforced segregation it        58    00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.160    carried only one possible meaning to        59    00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.599    them        60    00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.440    it expressed a judgment of inherent        61    00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.920    inferiority on the part of the minority        62    00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.239    race        63    00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.360    and the judges who understood the        64    00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.239    meaning that was apparent in 1954 would        65    00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.160    have violated their oaths to uphold the        66    00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.840    constitution        67    00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.840    if they had not held the segregation        68    00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.519    mandate unconstitutional        69    00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.800    again a rhetorical question        70    00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.239    did the judges of 1954 cross some limit        71    00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.879    of legitimacy into law making by stating        72    00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.400    a constitution that        73    00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.400    a conclusion that you will not find        74    00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.000    written in the constitution        75    00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.560    was it activism to act based on the        76    00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.400    current meaning of facts that at a        77    00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.480    purely objective level        78    00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.440    were about the same as plessy's facts 60        79    00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.319    years before        80    00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.560    again of course you know my answer        81    00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.480    and so much for the assumption that        82    00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.640    facts just lie there waiting for an        83    00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.000    objective judge to view        84    00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.159    them        85    00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.080    so let me like the like the lawyer i am        86    00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.159    sum up the case i've tried to present        87    00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.040    this afternoon        88    00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.840    the fair reading model fails to account        89    00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.400    for what the constitution actually says        90    00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.439    and it fails just as badly to understand        91    00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:55.280    what judges have no choice        92    00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.680    but to do the constitution is a pantheon        93    00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.159    of values and a lot of hard cases are        94    00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.640    hard        95    00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.200    because the constitution gives no simple        96    00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.120    rule of decision        97    00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.280    for the cases in which one of the values        98    00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.640    is truly at odds        99    00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.560    with another not even its most        100    00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.479    uncompromising and unconditional        101    00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:17.759    language can resolve        102    00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.120    every potential tension of one provision        103    00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.120    with another provision        104    00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.520    attention that the constitution's framer        105    00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.880    is left to be resolved another day        106    00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.080    and another day after that for our cases        107    00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.960    can give        108    00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.160    no answers that fit all conflicts        109    00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.320    and no resolutions that are immune to        110    00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.160    rethinking when the significance of old        111    00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.479    facts have changed        112    00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.680    with the changing world        113    00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.759    and these are reasons enough to show how        114    00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.840    egregiously it misses the point to think        115    00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.240    of judges in constitutional cases is        116    00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.759    just sitting there        117    00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.400    reading constitutional phrases fairly        118    00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.000    and looking at reported facts        119    00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.320    objectively to produce their judgments        120    00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.440    judges have to choose between the good        121    00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.440    things that the constitution approves        122    00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.680    and when they do        123    00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.759    they have to choose not on the basis of        124    00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:15.280    measurements but of meanings        125    00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.440    the fair reading model misses that        126    00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.800    but it misses even more        127    00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.520    remember that the tensions that are the        128    00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.759    stuff of judging in so many hard        129    00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:30.000    constitutional cases are        130    00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.880    after all creatures of our aspirations        131    00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.720    aspirations to liberty as well as to        132    00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.960    order        133    00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.080    into fairness and equality as well as to        134    00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.479    liberty        135    00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.520    and the very opportunity for conflict        136    00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.240    between        137    00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.680    one high value and another reflects our        138    00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.600    confidence that a way may be found to        139    00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.520    resolve it when a conflict arises        140    00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.440    that is why the simplistic view of the        141    00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.759    constitution devalues our aspirations        142    00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:08.160    and it attacks our confidence and it        143    00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.039    diminishes        144    00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.199    us it is a view of judging        145    00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.800    that means to discourage our tenacity        146    00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.479    including i sometimes reluctant        147    00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:24.080    tenacity to keep the constitutional        148    00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.360    promises the nation has been made        149    00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.080    so it is tempting it is tempting to        150    00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.319    dismiss the critical record of        151    00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:37.199    rhetoric of law making and activism        152    00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:39.280    is simply a rejection of too many of the        153    00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.600    hopes we profess to share        154    00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.800    as the american people        155    00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.880    but there is one thing more        156    00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.599    i have to believe that something deeper        157    00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:55.199    is involved        158    00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:58.160    and that behind most of the dreams of a        159    00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.639    simpler constitution there lies a basic        160    00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:01.120    human        161    00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.400    hunger for the certainty and control        162    00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.639    the fair reading model seems to promise        163    00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.520    and who has not felt that same hunger        164    00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:15.919    is there any one of us who has not lived        165    00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:18.240    through moments        166    00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.720    and perhaps years of longing for a world        167    00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.080    without any ambiguity        168    00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.720    for the stability of something        169    00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.360    unchangeable in human        170    00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.160    institutions        171    00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:36.800    i don't forget my own longing        172    00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.360    a longing for certainty that resisted        173    00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.479    the pronouncement        174    00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:42.880    of justice holmes which i read as an        175    00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.599    undergraduate        176    00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:47.759    the certainty generally is illusion and        177    00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:51.120    repose is not our destiny        178    00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.800    but i have come to understand that he        179    00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.039    was right        180    00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:57.039    and by the same token i understand that        181    00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:59.599    i differ from the critics i've described        182    00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:01.840    not merely in seeing the patent wisdom        183    00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.000    of brown        184    00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.160    or in espousing the rule excluding        185    00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.360    unlawfully seized evidence        186    00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.680    or in understanding the scope of habeas        187    00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.680    corpus        188    00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.440    where i suspect we differ most        189    00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.720    fundamentally is in my belief        190    00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.199    that in an indeterminate world i cannot        191    00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:22.560    control it is still        192    00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.680    possible to live fully        193    00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.680    in the trust that away will be found        194    00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.080    leading through the future        195    00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.199    uncertain as it is        196    00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:35.360    and to me the future of the constitution        197    00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.279    as the framers wrote it can be staked        198    00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:41.360    only upon that same trust        199    00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.519    if we cannot share every intellectual        200    00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:45.120    assumption that formed the minds of        201    00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.160    those who framed the charter        202    00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.399    we can still address the constitutional        203    00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:51.760    uncertainties        204    00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.519    the way they must have envisioned        205    00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:59.360    by relying on reason by respecting        206    00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.360    all the words the framers wrote        207    00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.120    by facing facts and by seeking to        208    00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.240    understand        209    00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.519    the meaning of those facts        210    00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:14.480    for living people        211    00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.160    that is how a judge lives in a state of        212    00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.000    trust        213    00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.720    and i know of no other way to make good        214    00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.880    on the aspirations that        215    00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.920    tell us who we are and who we mean to be        216    00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:37.839    as the people of the united states        217

   00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.520    in my sophomore year        2    00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.160    i came across an ode that t.s eliot        3    00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.359    penned        4    00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.480    for his harvard graduation a little over        5    00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.360    a century ago        6    00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.200    elliot wrote of his departure from        7    00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.600    undergraduate life        8    00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.400    we turn as thy sons ever turn in        9    00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.240    strength        10    00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.000    of the hopes that thy blessings bestow        11    00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.240    from the hopes and ambitions that sprang        12    00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.320    at thy feet        13    00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.960    to the thoughts of the past as we go        14    00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.760    i wondered as i read it what thoughts of        15    00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.000    the past might t.s eliot have carried        16    00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.200    with him        17    00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.680    from a harvard so different than that        18    00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.079    we've come to know        19    00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.399    my friends and i began asking how we        20    00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.320    remember harvard        21    00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.879    which of our cambridge memories would        22    00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:53.920    cast that long        23    00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.879    shadow of our young selves across        24    00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.000    whatever future is await        25    00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.440    there's much to remember of the past        26    00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.680    four years for these have been times of        27    00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.519    great change for harvard        28    00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.240    and for ourselves we've seen the        29    00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.479    inauguration of the university's first        30    00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.119

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.280    regardless of what contractual        34    00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.920    obligations you might be under you        35    00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.520    should always use a barricade        36    00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.119    at a girl talk concert        37    00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.320    here we've been humbled by the first        38    00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.200    failures        39    00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.840    of our young lives and grown bold        40    00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.280    walking grounds once tread by greatness        41    00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.200    we've come to know each other as only        42    00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.360    harvard students can        43    00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.119    forming bonds in long afternoons of        44    00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.399    leisure and charles        45    00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.920    and in the late night anxieties of        46    00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.880    lamont strengthening our ties to each        47    00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.320    other        48    00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.560    in the hopes of early years        49    00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.840    tomorrow when we graduate these become        50    00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.360    things of the past we're told that it's        51    00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.159    time to move on        52    00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.640    there's an anxiety in this change a        53    00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.360    bitterness        54    00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.440    in leaving those who knew us as we came        55    00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.000    to know ourselves        56    00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000    for me there's a fear that more than        57    00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.080    specific lunches or lectures        58    00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.840    i'd only remember that feeling of        59    00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.319    harvard of sharing with friends        60    00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.040    the energy of limitless potential along        61    00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.319    with the sad wisdom that one day        62    00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.440    very soon now our time together        63    00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.480    would come to a close        64    00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.200    and hoping to steal this anxiety i broke        65    00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.959    a promise i made to myself the day i        66    00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.200    submitted my senior thesis        67    00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.680    and i returned from one last time to a        68    00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.959    harvard university library        69    00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.560    it was here that i came across the        70    00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.400    memoirs of a lieutenant in the first        71    00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.480    world war calvin wellington day        72    00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.160    at harvard he's been a student of        73    00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.000    physics from 1912-1914        74    00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.400    a gifted student who enjoyed evenings in        75    00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.519    his graduate student        76    00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.920    physics laboratory and evenings of        77    00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.800    typically collegiate mischief        78    00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.959    calvin wrote affectionately of his final        79    00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.480    days in cambridge        80    00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.440    of green lawns and graduation capturing        81    00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.120    that electricity        82    00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.360    of being young and fearless at        83    00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.519    university        84    00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.519    after he graduated he returned to the        85    00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.760    yard for one last look        86    00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.440    he wrote quite poetically i think        87    00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.760    that he did not believe a place could        88    00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.519    change so quickly        89    00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.680    as did harvard square after class day        90    00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.680    the yard was like a vase with its        91    00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.760    flowers removed        92    00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.480    yet beautiful        93    00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.799    calvin's wartime letters possessed that        94    00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.720    same lyricism        95    00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.400    the impassioned patriotism of a young        96    00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.000    man ready to save the world        97    00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.959    the eager loyalty of a harvard alumnus        98    00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.560    concerned with the scores of the latest        99    00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.319    yale game        100    00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.239    and the fate of his university friends        101    00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.040    but as his time in europe drew on        102    00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.879    calvin's letters began to reveal that        103    00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.040    ugliness of world war one        104    00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.799    the chaos of battle and the madness of        105    00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.280    an action        106    00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.480    nine days before his death at the second        107    00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.160    battle of yupre        108    00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.079    calvin was ordered to the small village        109    00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.799    of casal france        110    00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.800    he wrote of his arrival i pushed my bike        111    00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.680    up        112    00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.160    to the highest point where there was an        113    00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.680    old chateau        114    00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.840    a little park and a wireless station        115    00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.400    here i was agreeably and intensely        116    00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.759    surprised        117    00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.680    the only other soldier up there was        118    00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.960    brokenshire        119    00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.080    harvard class of 1916.        120    00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.560    i hadn't seen him since we left camp in        121    00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.479    england        122    00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.199    we sat in one of those stone bastions        123    00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.120    very like those from fresh pond in        124    00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.560    cambridge which i remember        125    00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.600    so well overlooking the level plane in        126    00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.160    the midst        127    00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.919    and gathering darkness here we talked of        128    00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:02.800    harvard        129    00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.440    and of cambridge the places and girls        130    00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.440    we'd known        131    00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.600    it was a pleasing and impressive sight        132    00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.600    in the setting sun        133    00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.759    and i was sorry to leave him to it        134    00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.960    though calvin couldn't know that this        135    00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.520    was the last time he'd meet his friend        136    00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.120    though he was never again to set foot in        137    00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.520    the yard the memories of harvard that        138    00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.039    calvin wellington day        139    00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.919    carried with him gave him peace in        140    00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.520    disquiet        141    00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.520    a loyal friend when the world was at war        142    00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.440    he departed from harvard with that same        143    00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.000    heavy sadness that weighs upon us all        144    00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.240    but quickly found that behind his fears        145    00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.600    of leaving        146    00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.199    was the truth that he'd never left        147    00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.840    harvard behind        148    00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.680    i found a sort of confidence in the        149    00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.320    letters of calvin wellington day        150    00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.840    that whether we're destined for new york        151    00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.639    or new guinea harvard will remain beside        152    00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:57.199    us        153    00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:59.280    long after commencement has come and        154    00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.880    passed        155    00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.199    i've come to see the buildings around us        156    00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:04.560    widener and well        157    00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.000    siever and robinson not as tombs        158    00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.800    for the best years of our lives past but        159    00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.800    as enduring monuments to those feelings        160    00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.199    of unsettled excitement        161    00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:18.800    for the lives we're about to begin        162    00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.840    on friday we set out to realize        163    00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.000    all that we've hoped for together these        164    00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.560    past four years        165    00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.360    when life has done its worst and i need        166    00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.400    a friend        167    00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.280    i know i'll look no further than to        168    00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.520    those who stood beside me        169    00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.960    through the trials of undergraduate        170    00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.120    years        171    00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.880    and when we feel that the weight of the        172    00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.639    world rests squarely upon our shoulders        173    00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.440    when uglier times are upon us harvard        174    00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.479    gives us a place of glad escape        175    00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:53.520    a better age of our best selves to        176    00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.680    remember        177    00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.919    these i think are the thoughts of the        178    00:06:57.919 --> 00:06:58.720    past        179    00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.199    that t.s eliot anticipated when he        180    00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:03.039    closed his palm        181    00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:07.039    he wrote yet for all of these years        182    00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:10.080    that tomorrow has lost we still        183    00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.520    are less able to grieve for so much that        184    00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.240    of harvard        185    00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.599    we carry away in the place of the life        186    00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:19.680    that we leave        187    00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.800    like elliot i'm unsure what will come        188    00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.720    from the hopes and ambitions that sprang        189    00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.960    here        190    00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:28.840    i don't know when and where we'll meet        191    00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.240    again        192    00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.000    but in the memoirs of a lieutenant from        193    00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.360    the first world war        194    00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.319    i found reason to believe this much that        195    00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:37.919    we'll never forget        196    00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:41.120    what this place has meant to us each nor        197    00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.479    what we have meant        198    00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:45.840    to each other

enough um it has        14    00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.200    occurred to me that I was meant to        15    00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.320    include cliche advice as a final        16    00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.879    half-baked afterthought thrown in at the        17    00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.680    conclusion of my Reflections um I would        18    00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.199    like to caution you all cliched advice        19    00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.239    was not originally part of my prepared        20    00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.440    remarks uh fortunately I have spoken        21    00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.399    with Dean Hammond and she has graciously        22    00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.920    agreed to create a task force on cliched        23    00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.480    advice to formulate some        24    00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.400    recommendations I encourage you all to        25    00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.280    peruse this report when it is scheduled        26    00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.759    to be released in August        27    00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.560    2017 now I will proceed with my original        28    00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.159    speech first I would like to say hey to        29    00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.960    all of you with a slight vertical head        30    00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.960    nod        31    00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.320    hey this isn't tcid acknowledgement that        32    00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.200    we once met during freshman week and of        33    00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.840    course this has been our customary        34    00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.360    greeting when Crossing PA in the yard        35    00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.079    for the past 4 years typically you        36    00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.479    respond what's up with a similar        37    00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.600    vertical head thrust an absolutely zero        38    00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.720    intention to wait for my        39    00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.119    reply and these conversations have been        40    00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.439    deeply rewarding for        41    00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.640    me I feel immensely fortunate that we        42    00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.000    have been able to share countless        43    00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.360    moments like these ever since that first        44    00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.680    ice cream social when you ask me whether        45    00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.680    or not I have any siblings and then we        46    00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.799    made out two        47    00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.560    times today however I would like to        48    00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.520    extend that normal dialogue by for once        49    00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.640    actually telling you what is up and when        50    00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.879    I say dialogue I mean        51    00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.000    monologue I will continue speaking for        52    00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.720    the next four minutes and you will have        53    00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.360    no opportunity to        54    00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.879    respond and also in case this is it all        55    00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.080    unclear if we ever by chance run into        56    00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.680    each other in the future out shopping        57    00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.360    for private jets        58    00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.840    or perhaps perhaps inside White Collar        59    00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.280    penitentiaries we will of course return        60    00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.440    to the hey vertical head nod what's up        61    00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.200    vertical head nod interactions which        62    00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.920    have served us both so well for so        63    00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.360    long no In fairness we may not have        64    00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.959    gotten to know each other perfectly well        65    00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.840    during our time here a few of you sure        66    00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.000    but these true friends have already        67    00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.280    heard this speech 44 times and are no        68    00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.840    longer paying any        69    00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.319    attention        70    00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.440    nevertheless every graduate sitting here        71    00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.599    today shares a collective experience        72    00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.519    that bonds us and differentiates us from        73    00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.760    the world of people Beyond these Gates        74    00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.360    whom we are categorically better than        75    00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.519    across every conceivable        76    00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.840    metric I am joking of course that is not        77    00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.959    entirely true researchers have shown        78    00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.680    that once they leave college Yale        79    00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.680    graduates are uniformly better than us        80    00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.239    at musical        81    00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.000    theater and coping with life wrenching        82    00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.280    failure unsurprisingly they also cope        83    00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.840    very well when they fail to have anyone        84    00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.400    show up for their musical theater        85    00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.680    Productions in complete seriousness        86    00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.200    though we are a special group we are the        87    00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.599    Harvard class of        88    00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.959    2010 we share a lot we share Memories We        89    00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.200    Share ideas we share cabs to Logan        90    00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.159    Airport compared to the general        91    00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.319    population we share statistically        92    00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.760    significantly lower incidence of        93    00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.720    sexually transmitted        94    00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.920    diseases we also share an unusual        95    00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.560    appreciation for statistics        96    00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.640    jokes we share dining hall utensils        97    00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.479    every day I am not joking we've all        98    00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.560    sucked on the same        99    00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.000    Forks they are on        100    00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.880    rotation and hopefully in the future we        101    00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.320    will all share our incomes and vacation        102    00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.440    homes with those who generously        103    00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.440    entertained us here today by giving a        104    00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.880    class Day        105    00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.840    speech my fellow graduates we share a        106    00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.960    lot I look out among you and I see a        107    00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.400    remarkably pale disillusioned sexually        108    00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.280    frustrated group of        109    00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.120    individuals why did we do this to        110    00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.680    ourselves what did Harvard offer us that        111    00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.160    was worth this pain and suffering        112    00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.919    I know what you're thinking the        113    00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.800    people        114    00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.840    nope most Harvard students are        115    00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.759    deags the real reason we all slog        116    00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.440    through this eternal spuler of undying        117    00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.479    misery and despair is because of course        118    00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.639    we learn a lot at Harvard mostly useless        119    00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.560    crap but every so often we learn those        120    00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.560    quintessential Veritas soaked life        121    00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.840    lessons that MIT graduates can only        122    00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.000    dream of having digitally implanted into        123    00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.600    their robotic        124    00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.280    Brands lesson one at Harvard we learned        125    00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.319    that exclusive is always a synonym for        126    00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:51.400    awesome with the rare exception of        127    00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.400    expository writing        128    00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.479    10 everything else becomes infinitely        129    00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:00.720    more more appealing when you can bar a        130    00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.120    large portion of the population from        131    00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.960    ever        132    00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.960    participating look no further than the        133    00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.400    Lampoon final clubs Teach for        134    00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.080    America and oh yeah Harvard        135    00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.120    itself for this reason my next joke will        136    00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.759    be exclusive to my Blackberry Messenger        137    00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:21.639    friends just the six of        138    00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.120    them give me one        139    00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.400    second I'm actually typing this joke in        140    00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.160    binary so I guess only half of you will        141    00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.680    be able to get        142    00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.160    it and scent That's a        143    00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.400    classic I can hear the chuckles out        144    00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:44.520    there second lesson at Harvard I have        145    00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.160    learned that Boko will pay $1,250 to        146    00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.720    advertise their new strawberry kiwi        147    00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.479    smoothie in front of a captive

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.759    delicious bco inspired        152    00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:10.840    smoothies now would be a great time to        153    00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.120    take a        154    00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:19.680    photo final lesson we all learn to never        155    00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.879    trust anyone who ever went to        156    00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:24.160    Harvard and yes I realized that this        157    00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.919    completely nullifies everything I've        158    00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:27.400    said        159    00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.400    today but the fact is that that here we        160    00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.639    learned a lot to everyone even our best        161    00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:36.479    friends for example don't worry        162    00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:38.720    investment Banks love history of art and        163    00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.240    architecture

tonight even our emergency text        167    00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:50.680    messaging service can only be trusted        168    00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.080    20% of the        169    00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.440    time this all may be hard to swallow you        170    00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.560    might say wait James look a message from        171    00:07:58.560 -->

 174    00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.400    wrong and that's all there is to it        175    00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.400    really fortunately I think between these        176    00:08:12.400 -->

aware and fully on board        6    00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.070    in 1947 Secretary of State Marshall said        7    00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.750    this about post-war Europe to his        8    00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.060    Harvard graduates he said I need not        9    00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.010    tell you that the world situation is        10    00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.949    very serious that must be apparent to        11    00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.130    all intelligent people but he said I        12    00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.890    think one difficulty is that the problem        13    00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.040    is of such enormous complexity that the        14    00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.590    very massive facts presented to the        15    00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.379    public by the press and radio make it        16    00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.079    exceedingly difficult for the man in the        17    00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.300    street to reach a clear appraisement of        18    00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.180    the situation and furthermore he went on        19    00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.820    the people of this country a distant        20    00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.489    from the troubled areas of the earth and        21    00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.980    from and it's hard for them to        22    00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.370    comprehend that is precisely the same        23    00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.090    today rebuilding Europe and Japan after        24    00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.460    World War two resulted in peaceful        25    00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.770    stable democracies that for long periods        26    00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.110    were also economic powerhouses that        27    00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.540    never threatened Europe or the United        28    00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.420    States again but in order for your        29    00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.500    government today to adequately address        30    00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.090    Afghanistan and Haiti and Iraq and all        31    00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.159    the places that I've mentioned to even        32    00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.890    have a shot at success I've come to        33    00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.079    believe deeply in the strategic        34    00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.689    necessity of the people's right to know        35    00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.590    and their duty to be informed and that's        36    00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.140    where journalism comes in my profession        37    00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.240    and I really hope the profession that        38    00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.610    many graduates will choose because I        39    00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.560    strongly believe that this can be a        40    00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.009    great and noble endeavor it is a public        41    00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.470    trust if and when it serves the public        42    00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.229    interest I am a true believer in the        43    00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.479    power of this profession to be a force        44    00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.850    for good where would the world be        45    00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.130    without a press that's uncovered        46    00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.130    injustice corruption inhumanity or a        47    00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.750    press that's on the cutting edge of        48    00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.149    form of civil rights of desegregation        49    00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.060    and of all the smaller but vital issues        50    00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.640    that affect us every single day and that        51    00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.750    affect all our daily lives a press which        52    00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.080    pursues the truth often on pain of death        53    00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.780    and today ladies and gentlemen it is        54    00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.480    regrettable but painful death is the        55    00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.820    leading cause of the demise of        56    00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.880    journalists around the world murder        57    00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.350    deliberate attempts to shut down the        58    00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.480    message and to silence the messengers        59    00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.700    and those murders are the least        60    00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.420    investigated and those murderers act        61    00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.610    with impunity there is virtually no        62    00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.700    accountability and yet around the        63    00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.620    developing world where this phenomenon        64    00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.580    is so dangerous it is journalists and        65    00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.130    press who are on the cutting edge of        66    00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.850    reform who championed change who spur on        67    00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.450    democracy and who defend people's rights        68    00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.370    so I believe that as Jefferson said a        69    00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.280    strong and robust democracy even this        70    00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.250    one needs a fully informed citizenry        71    00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.560    it needs independent journalists of        72    00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.900    integrity and vigor who are not        73    00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.810    cripplingly cynical who are committed to        74    00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.180    reporting the facts without fear nor        75    00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.209    favor who insist on asking the rigorous        76    00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.030    questions and who insist on holding        77    00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.180    power accountable who never fear dissent        78    00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.519    but at the same time are never        79    00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.430    bludgeoned into confusing descent with        80    00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.549    disloyalty who believe also that having        81    00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.100    this platform in this voice this access        82    00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.980    comes with enormous and profound        83    00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.459    responsibility we in television have a        84    00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.760    patron saint his name is Edward R Morrow        85    00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.150    and in 1958 the year I was born he said        86    00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.190    this about what was then a newfangled        87    00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.370    invention called television he said that        88    00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.350    this instrument can teach it can        89    00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.019    illuminate and yes it can even inspire        90    00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.019    but it can do so only to the extent that        91    00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.480    humans are determined to use it to those        92    00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.900    ends otherwise it is merely wires and        93    00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.049    lights in a box but he went on to say        94    00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.840    that there is a great and perhaps        95    00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.410    decisive battle        96    00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.630    we fought against ignorance intolerance        97    00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.420    and indifference and this weapon of        98    00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.140    television could be useful and I believe        99    00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.990    that there is nothing more useful than        100    00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.390    television done well and nothing more        101    00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.270    powerful I believe also the contrary to        102    00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.510    what many of our thought leaders tell us        103    00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.270    Americans are and do care about the        104    00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.090    world and their place in it remember the        105    00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.860    amazing statistic leading up to the        106    00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.800    election of 2008 when the vast majority        107    00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.680    of Americans said that a key desire for        108    00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.570    their next president was for him to        109    00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.330    restore America's place and prestige in        110    00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.240    this world so it's for all of those        111    00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.380    reasons that like you today I also AM        112    00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.200    holding my breath and jumping into the        113    00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.740    unknown because after 27 years of loving        114    00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.800    and leaving living and breathing CNN I'm        115    00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.830    taping up an incredible new opportunity        116    00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.470    and also a challenge to host this week        117    00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.570    the distinguished Sunday morning news        118    00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.270    and political affairs program on ABC        119    00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.360    News because I will have I hope one        120    00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.180    extraordinary opportunity and chance to        121    00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.760    reach a larger American audience and to        122    00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.520    try simply to add to the conversation to        123    00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.220    explore substantive issues that affect        124    00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.090    people beyond just pure politics and        125    00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.060    also to bring a perspective on the world        126    00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.370    that I have been able to accumulate from        127    00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.850    living and working abroad and traveling        128    00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.810    around to tell people's stories I        129    00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.669    believe so deeply in the promise and the        130    00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.880    ability of America and Americans that it        131    00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.430    does often frustrate me to see the        132    00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.590    limited discussion in so many of our        133    00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.470    public spaces and public press are the        134    00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.730    substantive issues and moreover to see        135    00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.160    only such a slim sliver of the world        136    00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.950    that ever breaks through on to the        137    00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.260    airwaves here in this country and yet as        138    00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.080    I travel all over the world people        139    00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.050    everywhere from the slums of the poorest        140    00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.000    poorest hovels to the salons of the        141    00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.890    richest places they know everything        142    00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.160    about you everything about your country        143    00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.320    more than 30 years ago when revolution        144    00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.870    rumbled across my country Iran when my        145    00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:39.410    father        146    00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.900    sadly told me it's all over and that        147    00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.300    nothing would be the same again I was        148    00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.300    afraid I was 20 years old and this was        149    00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.060    my political awakening and the Islamic        150    00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.830    Revolution that shook Iran was the        151    00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.350    world's first and it did not only shake        152    00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.570    Iran it shook America and it shook the        153    00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.020    rest of the world and it still is but        154    00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.440    that forced me to suddenly become an        155    00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.500    adult in a turbulent world after a calm        156    00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.110    and privileged childhood growing up in        157    00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.880    the shah's Iran where we didn't do        158    00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.600    politics        159    00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.030    I remember the violence in the streets        160    00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.310    the martial law the soldiers with the        161    00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.220    fixed bayonets in our face if we broke        162    00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.410    the curfew and the protests filled        163    00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:21.980    streets        164    00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.050    I remember evening sitting with my        165    00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.419    parents and my sisters on our porch and        166    00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:29.450    we could hear the sounds from the mosque        167    00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.560    as Ayatollah Khomeini's deep voice        168    00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.540    secretly smuggled in on audio tapes        169    00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.390    there was no internet no blog no Twitter        170    00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.120    no Facebook no global television this        171    00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.030    was before CNN on audio tapes into the        172    00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.120    mosque rumbling low and determined over        173    00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.360    our neighborhood and everywhere and        174    00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.070    overnight the revolution turned us into        175    00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.979    strangers into our own land we lost our        176    00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:57.200    home we lost our possessions we lost        177    00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.600    family and friends people were jailed        178    00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.630    people were tortured people including        179    00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.200    members of my family

00:00:27.519    george marshall said        12    00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.199    to his college graduates at harvard in        13    00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.320    1947.        14    00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.079    after graduating from the university of        15    00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.440    rhode island 20        16    00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.280    27 years ago i joined cnn in its infancy        17    00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.160    and i joined        18    00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.200    a band of pioneers we were all college        19    00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.000    graduates just        20    00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.920    like you fomenting a media revolution        21    00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.480    we were implementing ted turner's unique        22    00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.440    vision        23    00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.640    for the first ever 24 7 network        24    00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.039    for the first ever global network and        25    00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.079    for the first ever        26    00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.760    truly global village like many of my        27    00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.399    friends        28    00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.239    i started at the very bottom of the        29    00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.479    career ladder i actually arrived        30    00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.240    in atlanta georgia with a hundred        31    00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.920    dollars with a suitcase        32    00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.799    and with my bicycle i was assigned first        33    00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.240    to the foreign desk        34    00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.479    the foreign assignment desk because i        35    00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.000    was foreign        36    00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.840    i climbed past the doubters and the        37    00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.320    naysayers and i worked nights and came        38    00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.720    in weekends to practice and practice and        39    00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.119    plow my way up to where i wanted to be        40    00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.960    i wanted to be roaming the world i        41    00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.640    wanted to be telling stories        42    00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.119    i wanted to be telling taking risks and        43    00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.119    i wanted to be having fun        44    00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.880    and doing it all on someone else's dime        45    00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.079    and it was all so exhilarating on the        46    00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.159    road over the last two decades my        47    00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.920    friends my colleagues and i        48    00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.079    we look at each other and we marvel at        49    00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.280    the sheer        50    00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.240    heart-stopping significance of all that        51    00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.000    we were privileged to witness        52    00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.920    and all the stories we were fortunate to        53    00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.520    be able to tell        54    00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.680    and at this point i must say        55    00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.680    another may be cliche but the advantage        56    00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.360    of cliches is that they happen to be        57    00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.759    true        58    00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.840    and we only learn that when we go out        59    00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.800    and live them        60    00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.039    that there is no such thing as        61    00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.440    effortless success        62    00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.599    that mastering your craft is so        63    00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.000    important and mastery only comes        64    00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.400    with hard work and no matter how great        65    00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.000    an education you've had        66    00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.239    or what privileges life has afforded you        67    00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.520    so far        68    00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.120    mastery mission purpose        69    00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.239    those i think        70    00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.800    like for me trying to do all that were        71    00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.560    my greatest motivators        72    00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.400    and i believe like they were for me        73    00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.160    trying to achieve all that        74    00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.720    that is the greatest satisfaction not        75    00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.200    the simple accumulation of wealth        76    00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.000    and right now i passionately wish for        77    00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.040    all of you        78    00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.239    to find something that sets you on fire        79    00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.040    that fills you with a joy and a love and        80    00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.800    a commitment        81    00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.840    and i also hope that you'll be ready        82    00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.080    when your moral courage is called upon        83    00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.280    and it will be        84    00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.280    and here you might say that i'd        85    00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.200    cross-checked with president        86    00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.159    files that i had cross-checked with dean        87    00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.840    hammonds        88    00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.680    about the patron saint apparently of        89    00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.519    harvard former u.s attorney general        90    00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.440    robert f kennedy but i want to quote him        91    00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.599    on moral courage        92    00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.840    when he went to south africa when nelson        93    00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.519    mandela was serving out what        94    00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.720    turned out to be a 28-year jail sentence        95    00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.400    simply for seeking justice for the        96    00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.440    majority there        97    00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.840    and justice for everybody this is what        98    00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.440    robert kennedy said        99    00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.360    that few men are willing to brave the        100    00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.040    disapproval of their fellows        101    00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.280    the censure of their colleagues and the        102    00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.360    wrath of their society        103    00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.440    moral courage he said is a rarer        104    00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.440    commodity than bravery and battle        105    00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.720    or great intelligence and yet it is the        106    00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.200    one        107    00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.159    essential vital quality for those who        108    00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.000    seek to change the world        109    00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.439    which yields most painfully to change        110    00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:59.680    and just as i discovered that journalism        111    00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.439    can really make a difference you too        112    00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.599    can all make a difference in anything        113    00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.840    and everything that you choose        114    00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.400    i know that you can all make your mark        115    00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.319    and along the way        116    00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.239    never be afraid of falling or failing        117    00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.959    or more more to the point never equate        118    00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.880    setbacks with failure        119    00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.880    because you are all high achievers and        120    00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.240    you will all take        121    00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.320    risks but it's how you deal with        122    00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.000    adversity and how you deal with        123    00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.960    disappointment        124    00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.000    that will define you my friend the        125    00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.840    celebrated iranian photographer and        126    00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.840    artist shireen neshat        127    00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.360    has said that the fundamental thing        128    00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.560    about the process of being an artist        129    00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.040    you can insert there whatever you choose        130    00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.000    to do        131    00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.720    is failure you have to learn to accept        132    00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.199    that you        133    00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.600    are going to fail at times that it is        134    00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.520    similarly important for your critics        135    00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.280    your audience and your peers to        136    00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.520    understand that this        137    00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.560    failure is part of growth that there's        138    00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.320    nothing wrong with failure        139    00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.479    you fail or you fall and then you pick        140    00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:01.680    yourself up again        141    00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.320    and it is that very process that counts        142    00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.680    in the end        143    00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.160    so as i too get set to graduate from my        144    00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.000    alma mater cnn        145    00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.240    to move on to abc news to take up this        146    00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.919    extraordinary challenge        147    00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.360    i'm sure that we all all of us graduates        148    00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.479    here today        149    00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.199    share the same sense of excitement the        150    00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:21.759    same        151    00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.759    sense of promise of a brave new        152    00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.199    adventure        153    00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.240    the same shadow of fear        154    00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.000    trepidation anxiety as we now        155    00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.440    hurl ourselves out of our comfort zones        156    00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.919    but as i started by saying whatever you        157    00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:39.280    decide to do        158    00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.560    do well for yourselves but also do good        159    00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.479    for your families for your friends for        160    00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.039    your communities and for your countries        161    00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.080    for our shared world as you

      186    00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.080    american president theodore roosevelt        187    00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.240    went to paris and he spoke at the        188    00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.560    sorbonne university to students just        189    00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.520    like you        190    00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.280    i'm sure you all know this quote but i'm        191    00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.960    going to say it again because i love it        192    00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.240    i hope you do        193    00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.080    he said that it's not the critic who        194    00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.800    counts the credit belongs to the man        195    00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.919    and woman who is actually in the arena        196    00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.880    whose face is marred by dust and sweat        197    00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.599    and blood and who strives valiantly        198    00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:08.240    who errs and who comes up short again        199    00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.360    and again        200    00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.919    who knows great enthusiasms great        201    00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:12.960    devotions        202    00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.520    and who spends himself herself in a        203    00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.000    worthy        204    00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.720    cause who at the best knows in the end        205    00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.720    the triumph of high achievement        206    00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.000    and who at the worst if he or she fails        207    00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.440    at least fails while daring greatly        208    00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.080    and so that his or her place shall never        209    00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.800    be        210    00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.120    with those cold and timid souls who        211    00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.720    neither know victory        212    00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.680    nor defeat i love those words it's a        213    00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.960    call to action        214    00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.520    i hope you do too and i hope you have        215    00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.080    fun        216    00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.199    i hope you enjoy your life and your work        217    00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:47.280    and live in this moment whatever it        218    00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.479    might be        219    00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:50.400    goodbye and good luck and thank you for        220    00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.919    having me

critical and comical news casting a        11    00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.160    graduate of Ohio University Matt's 20        12    00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.110    years in broadcasting have made him a        13    00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.600    globally recognizable figure who tackles        14    00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.250    interviews with international figure        15

events he        20    00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.039    has interviewed political Giants such as        21    00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.949    Hillary Clinton George W Bush and Barack        22

known segment where in the world is Matt        25    00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.540    Lauer while on today matt has also come        26    00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.670    in contact with a number of cultural        27    00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.610    icons like Prince William Michael Phelps        28    00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.990    Sarah Palin and even Britney Spears        29    00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.790    oddly though despite such a wide array        30    00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.190    of locations and guess matt has never        31    00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.790    broadcast from dear old Harvard Nick do        32    00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.830    you think Matt is unaware of how truly        33    00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.040    exotic we Harvard students can be I mean        34    00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.840    don't you think we share a striking        35    00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.400    number of similarities with Britney        36    00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.930    Spears perhaps Jen but I think this may        37    00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.750    have less to do I think this may have        38    00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.850    last less to do with Harvard lacking and        39    00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.280    exotic Flair and maybe more about our        40    00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.430    intimidation factor Matt recently told        41    00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.200    talk-show host jimmy fallon that he was        42    00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.760    a little nervous to be speaking at        43    00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.310    harvard really Matt I think you've dealt        44    00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.540    with many things that are more        45    00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.270    frightening than us Harvard students an        46    00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.500    aggressive Tom Cruz defending        47    00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.570    Scientology seems slightly more        48    00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.830    intimidating than Reverend Gomes and        49    00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.420    what about that deer that ran into you        50    00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.579    while you were cycling Matt wasn't he        51    00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:13.060    scarier        52    00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.459    to be honest I rarely see a Harvard        53    00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.849    student tackle any cyclists and surely        54    00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.250    Ann Coulter is far more frightening than        55    00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.440    the seven-member Harvard Republican Club        56    00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.000    so we hope that today has shown you that        57    00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.500    there's actually nothing to be afraid of        58    00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.420    and we're actually quite friendly and a        59    00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.970    lot of fun and who knows one day you may        60    00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.260    even be interviewing a member of our        61    00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.530    class but please go easy on us we may        62    00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.680    still be recovering from senior week        63    00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.760    ladies and gentlemen it is our pleasure        64    00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.620    to

Lauer what makes        91    00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.970    you think that a student of your caliber        92    00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.390    should apply to Harvard        93    00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.470    well even back then I had a little bit        94    00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.940    of a chip on my shoulder and I said well        95    00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.489    let's start with my SATs shall we I got        96    00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.630    780 in verbal 800 in math and he started        97    00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.090    to thumb through my file on his desk and        98    00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.769    he looked back and he took off his glass        99    00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.650    and he said mr. Lauer you do not get to        100    00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.050    add up the scores from all three times        101    00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.160    you took the SAT        102    00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.020    all right good to know right and then he        103    00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.820    said the words that would send me on my        104    00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.280    course in life or at least my course to        105    00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.970    Ohio University in Athens Ohio he said        106    00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.270    mr. Lauer you applying to Harvard would        107    00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.780    be the biggest waste of $15 in the        108    00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.240    history of $15 now I would be lying to        109    00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.640    you if I told you it didn't make me a        110    00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.460    little mad but I would also be lying too        111    00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.330    if I told you he wasn't right so I stand        112    00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.560    here now some 35 years later and unless        113    00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.440    Ashton Kutcher jumps up from one row in        114    00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.910    the next 30 seconds in the slough er        115    00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.630    you've been Punk'd I think this will be        116    00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.030    the sweetest and most unlikely        117    00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.970    come-from-behind victory since a        118    00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.320    baseball went through bill Buckner's        119    00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:30.580    legs in 1986 don't give me the booze        120    00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.450    you're over that by now let me give you        121    00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.380    a little background on how this        122    00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.750    invitation came about because looking        123    00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.340    out here I'm pretty sure none of you got        124    00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.210    to vote on this        125    00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.060    my executive producer the executive        126    00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.800    producer of the Today Show        127    00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.759    Jim Bell Harvard class of 89 came to me        128    00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:54.910    about four months ago by the way don't        129    00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.669    do that okay don't introduce yourself        130    00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.880    like he does Jim Bell Harvard class of        131    00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.630    89 this is my first piece of graduation        132    00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.460    advice that is a really good way to get        133    00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.789    a fat lip just because you went to a        134    00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:11.979    grade school you did not win an Academy        135    00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:13.599    Award you will not be introduced for the        136    00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.759    rest of your lives as Oscar winner Joe        137    00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:20.380    Blow Harvard class of 2009 so he comes        138    00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.639    to me and he says Matt I've been asked        139    00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:22.930    to invite you to be the class day        140    00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.900    speaker at Harvard this spring I was        141    00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.419    flattered but I immediately asked the        142    00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:30.789    question that any graduate of Ohio        143    00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:34.300    University would ask I said do I get an        144    00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.690    honorary degree I said do I get a        145    00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.389    doctorate he said no I said do I get a        146    00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:43.569    cap a gown a sash anything I can sell on        147    00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:47.560    eBay he said no and you know what I        148    00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.860    accepted it anyway but immediately        149    00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.449    immediately after I accepted the        150    00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:55.300    invitation I had second thoughts and the        151    00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.490    reason is this is a daunting task        152    00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.500    you are whether you know it or not an        153    00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.289    intimidating group take a good look        154    00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.419    around you look around you are as a        155    00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:08.159    group you don't look like much but        156    00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.040    there are some future world changers in        157    00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.680    this audience so obviously anyone who        158    00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.740    does what I'm doing right now has to        159    00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.380    wonder whether they can live up to        160    00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.450    expectations so I had these second        161    00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.920    thoughts I called my executive producer        162    00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.840    back and he answered the phone Jim Bell        163    00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:32.170    Harvard class of 89 he can be a real ass        164    00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.720    and I said Jim give me an idea who were        165    00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.310    some of the other people who have spoken        166    00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.580    at class days over the years and he said        167    00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.070    Oh Rodney Dangerfield George Plimpton        168    00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.880    Tom Brokaw Jane Pauley Eyal Dangerfield        169    00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.640    got no respect George Plimpton went        170    00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.840    around the world doing weird things        171    00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.970    writing about it or talking about on TV        172    00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.820    I've made a career out of doing that        173    00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.500    Brokaw and Polly were both Today show        174    00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.750    hosts I'm in my element so I thought        175    00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:00.140    great        176    00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.090    and just as he was about to hang up the        177    00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.190    phone he said oh and Bill Clinton and        178    00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.210    Mother Teresa        179    00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.980    I'm telling you he can be a real ass so        180    00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.290    I thought I right if Mother Teresa gave        181    00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.210    this speech at one time it gives me the        182    00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.590    opportunity to give you a little        183    00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.750    graduation advice using a story that        184    00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.660    involves mother Teresa so bear with me        185    00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.920    all right        186    00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.430    August 31st 1997 it was a Sunday it was        187    00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.790    also the day that Lady Diana died the        188    00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.290    next day Monday morning on The Today        189    00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:35.870    Show we launched into unprecedented        190    00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.900    coverage of Lady Diana's life and death        191    00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.750    all day Monday all two hours no other        192    00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.940    subject lady died all day Tuesday all        193    00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.220    two hours no other subject lady died all        194    00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.430    day Wednesday and all day Thursday well        195    00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.690    at the end of Thursday we got together        196    00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.370    and we thought maybe we should start to        197    00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.740    move back to more regular programming        198    00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.780    and so what we decided to do on that        199    00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.420    Friday September 5th was we would do the        200    00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.730    first hour of the show on Lady Diana and        201    00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.040    then we would move to a more regular        202    00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.290    interview in the second hour so our        203    00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.020    first subject or guest who was not        204    00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.000    directly related to Lady Diana on that        205    00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.530    Friday morning was the actor Michael        206    00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.080    Douglas he was going around to promote        207    00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.580    his new movie at the time called the        208    00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.720    game so I sat down next to Michael        209    00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.889    Douglas        210    00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:23.480    and I started to talk to him about his        211    00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.489    movie and then toward the end of the        212    00:09:25.489 --> 00:09:27.529    interview I decided maybe we can tie up        213    00:09:27.529 --> 00:09:30.379    all the stories of this week so I said        214    00:09:30.379 --> 00:09:34.759    Michael I know that you new lady died        215    00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:36.559    and I'm just curious your response to        216    00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:39.019    her death and he was very articulate and        217    00:09:39.019 --> 00:09:40.339    he said she was a wonderful woman a        218    00:09:40.339 --> 00:09:41.959    great humanitarian he said Matt but I        219    00:09:41.959 --> 00:09:44.119    have to be honest with you I'm a little        220    00:09:44.119 --> 00:09:47.689    bit overwhelmed at the volume of        221    00:09:47.689 --> 00:09:49.459    coverage that the network's have        222    00:09:49.459 --> 00:09:51.919    dedicated to lady died she was a great        223    00:09:51.919 --> 00:09:54.339    lady but if we spend all this time        224    00:09:54.339 --> 00:09:56.720    talking about the life and death of Lady        225    00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.339    die I don't know what are we gonna do        226    00:09:58.339 --> 00:10:02.259    when someone like a mother Teresa dies        227    00:10:02.259 --> 00:10:06.709    he said that at 8:15 on Eastern Time on        228    00:10:06.709 --> 00:10:09.949    Friday September 5th at noon Eastern        229    00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:12.109    Time on Friday September 5th mother        230    00:10:12.109 --> 00:10:13.939    Teresa did something she had never done        231    00:10:13.939 --> 00:10:19.100    before she died now I tell you this        232    00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.899    because this is my second piece of        233    00:10:20.899 --> 00:10:23.809    graduation advice if Michael Douglas        234    00:10:23.809 --> 00:10:27.019    ever mentions your name on national        235    00:10:27.019 --> 00:10:32.449    television lie down quickly if you have        236    00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:34.100    access to one of those children's        237    00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.169    aspirins take that and then lie down        238    00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:39.829    quickly as a group you just laughed at        239    00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:42.949    the death of Mother Teresa if we hurry        240    00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:46.329    we can make the 4:30 shuttle to hell I        241    00:10:46.329 --> 00:10:48.319    tried to think back over the last        242    00:10:48.319 --> 00:10:49.669    several months about any and all        243    00:10:49.669 --> 00:10:51.649    connections I might have to Harvard and        244    00:10:51.649 --> 00:10:54.470    I thought about this not long ago the        245    00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.169    executive producers of all three Network        246    00:10:57.169 --> 00:11:00.709    morning news shows CBS ABC and NBC were        247    00:11:00.709 --> 00:11:02.779    all Harvard graduates all at the very        248    00:11:02.779 --> 00:11:05.449    same time now that may make you proud it        249    00:11:05.449 --> 00:11:07.549    may make you what recoil in horror I        250    00:11:07.549 --> 00:11:09.980    don't know another connection Jeff        251    00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.329    Zucker I mentioned my executive producer        252    00:11:11.329 --> 00:11:14.899    Jim Bell Harvard class of 89 Jeff Zucker        253    00:11:14.899 --> 00:11:17.839    Harvard Class of 86 started at NBC as a        254    00:11:17.839 --> 00:11:19.850    researcher in the Olympics Department        255    00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.999    went on to become the youngest executive        256    00:11:22.999 --> 00:11:26.959    producer of The Today Show in history he        257    00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:29.509    then went on to become the chairman of        258    00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:33.289    NBC Universal he is my uber boss which        259    00:11:33.289 --> 00:11:34.639    brings me to something else I want to        260    00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:35.430    tell you        261    00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.310    if you seem to do what is normal around        262    00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.820    here        263    00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.040    and you leave Harbert Harvard and you        264    00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.320    can tin you up the ladder and you zoom        265    00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.480    to the top of your chosen profession I        266    00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.650    have no desire to work for you I'm being        267    00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.600    serious we can be friends today I will        268    00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.490    take pictures with your family members        269    00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.190    when we leave here we are adversaries we        270    00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.960    are competing for plum jobs in an        271    00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.410    ever-shrinking economy it is survival of        272    00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.240    the fittest now I realize that puts me        273    00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.880    at somewhat of a disadvantage but what I        274    00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.950    lack in academic pedigree        275    00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.260    I make up for in pettiness and        276    00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.860    aggressiveness so if you go off and        277    00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.140    become the CEO of a major company and in        278    00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.610    a couple of years I work for that        279    00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.040    company I will be your worst nightmare I        280    00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.980    will be the 60 year old disgruntled        281    00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.260    employee at the watercooler sowing the        282    00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.300    seeds of discontent so stay out of my        283    00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.460    way I am tired of working for Harvard        284    00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.030    graduates another connection and this        285    00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.890    one's weak the others were kind of weak        286    00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.410    actually - but this one's weak I used to        287    00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.120    host a television show here in Boston        288    00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.650    called talk of the town I was 30 years        289    00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:42.690    old I was single at the time and I'm        290    00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.780    riding the T one day from downtown out -        291    00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.850    I guess to Brookline set the green line        292    00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.730    still I'm on the Green Line I am sitting        293    00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.680    across from the most stunning young lady        294    00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.020    I have ever seen in my life she's        295    00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.510    wearing cutoff denim jeans a skin-tight        296    00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:01.290    faded harvard t-shirt blonde beautiful        297    00:13:01.290 -->

close to Coolidge corner I'm        300    00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.520    thinking if I get to my stop and I don't        301    00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.310    talk to her I will never see her again        302    00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.740    so uncharacteristically I got up the        303    00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.120    nerve and I walked over to her and I        304    00:13:15.120

00:16:19.490    live interview with the president in the        368    00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.920    map room at the White House as part of        369    00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.500    the pregame show 45 minutes before the        370    00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.930    kickoff there would be 40 or 50 million        371    00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.940    people watching this interview so I        372    00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.370    decided I would take my oldest child I        373    00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.590    have three seven five and two I would        374    00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.980    take my oldest child Jack to Washington        375    00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.320    to meet the new President of the United        376    00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.170    States and I got him all dressed up in        377    00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:43.820    his suit we went to the White House and        378    00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.040    we sat down and the interview began and        379    00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.800    I put Jack about ten feet from the        380    00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.390    president just out of the line of the        381    00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.180    cameras and as I'm sitting there knowing        382    00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.130    there are 50 million people watching and        383    00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.720    President Obama is answering my        384    00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.810    questions live on television I was taken        385    00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.420    by the moment and what I was getting to        386    00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.730    experience and I was thinking no        387    00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:06.290    disrespect to the president I was        388    00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:07.699    listening to him but I was thinking and        389    00:17:07.699 --> 00:17:10.970    I'm experiencing this with my son and I        390    00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.520    wanted to steal a glance just to see        391    00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.510    what he was thinking watching his father        392    00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.530    interviewing the most powerful man in        393    00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.199    the world and I look over at Jack ten        394    00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:23.630    feet from the president and there he is        395    00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:27.280    with his finger up his        396    00:17:29.999 --> 00:17:33.240    is priceless        397    00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:39.179    have a lot of kids make sure that you        398    00:17:39.179 --> 00:17:41.640    bring at least one preferably more but        399    00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.070    at least one person into your lives who        400    00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.409    will always look you right in the eye        401    00:17:46.409 --> 00:17:51.559    and tell you the truth every single time        402    00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:54.899    about the person you're dating about the        403    00:17:54.899 --> 00:17:57.390    outfit you're wearing about your hair        404    00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.809    about your breath bring one of those        405    00:18:00.809 --> 00:18:03.020    people into your lives and if possible        406    00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.539    try to be that truth teller for someone        407    00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:08.789    else that you love it will help you        408    00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:11.700    survive hard times and try to remember        409    00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.470    that while it is unfortunate in this        410    00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:15.899    crazy country we are often judged by the        411    00:18:15.899 --> 00:18:18.149    trappings we have the way the things we        412    00:18:18.149 --> 00:18:20.370    surround ourselves with our houses our        413    00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.059    cars our clothes and our cash but you        414    00:18:24.059 --> 00:18:27.960    will be defined not by the trimmings but        415    00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.220    by your character I remember vividly in        416    00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.470    1989 I was a news junky and I was        417    00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.330    watching an extraordinary event on live        418    00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.580    television Jim right then the Speaker of        419    00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.919    the House of Representatives forced to        420    00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:42.779    resign amid a personal scandal and he        421    00:18:42.779 --> 00:18:44.279    took to the floor of the House of        422    00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:46.529    Representatives and he began to speak        423    00:18:46.529 --> 00:18:49.380    and say his resignation and he was        424    00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.720    surrounded by all of his colleagues some        425    00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.880    of them had turned their back on him        426    00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.250    forcing his resignation and in this        427    00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.770    extraordinary moment he quoted Horace        428    00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:02.340    Greeley and what he said was Fame is a        429    00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:07.200    vapor popularity and accident riches        430    00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.010    take wing        431    00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:10.679    those who cheer you today will curse you        432    00:19:10.679 --> 00:19:14.929    tomorrow character is the only constant        433    00:19:14.929 --> 00:19:18.539    the word stuck with me because I think        434    00:19:18.539 --> 00:19:20.159    they're so true fame as a vapor it        435    00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:22.649    disappears on a breeze popularity is an        436    00:19:22.649 --> 00:19:25.020    accident who decides who's popular and        437    00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:25.620    who's not        438    00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.860    riches take wing hema we all learn that        439    00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.480    the hard way in these last couple of        440    00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.149    years those who cheer you today will        441    00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:34.500    curse you tomorrow if it hasn't already        442    00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.659    happened to you I guarantee you it will        443    00:19:36.659 --> 00:19:39.590    the only thing that remains constant is        444    00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.539    character over these last 20 years those        445    00:19:42.539 --> 00:19:44.490    words have come to my mind so many times        446    00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.710    often times to provide comfort        447    00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:49.110    sometimes hitting me like a bucket of        448    00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:53.460    cold water in the face and finally        449    00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.870    remember that although you've just spent        450    00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.490    four years and an awful lot of money on        451    00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.580    the best education money can buy what        452    00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.050    you did not get for your money in your        453    00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:03.510    effort is entitlement you did not win        454    00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.940    the lottery you did not win the chance        455    00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.440    to think that you're better than anyone        456    00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.380    else this education is a powerful tool        457    00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.300    but it is just one of the tools at your        458    00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.060    disposal I encourage you to use all your        459    00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:19.050    tools use your compassion your kindness        460    00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.320    your generosity your sense of fair play        461    00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.320    your sense of humor to build bridges to        462    00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.090    the people around you not to erect        463    00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:30.120    barricades I thought about you all as I        464    00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.290    was preparing for this speech a couple        465    00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.330    of weeks ago when President Obama        466    00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:36.690    selected Sonia Sotomayor as his choice        467    00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.190    for the Supreme Court and in describing        468    00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:41.130    why he made that selection he said he        469    00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:42.810    was looking for someone not just with        470    00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.360    ivory tower learning but someone with        471    00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.230    empathy and the personal touch I        472    00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:50.940    encourage you to have empathy to reach        473    00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.310    out to the people around you the people        474    00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.410    who have not been given the same        475    00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:57.860    advantages that you have all been given        476    00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:00.450    don't take yourselves too seriously you        477    00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:02.790    are young you can and will make mistakes        478    00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.400    lean on the people around you learn from        479    00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.750    their mistakes and learn from their        480    00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.120    successes and continue to learn long        481    00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.890    after you leave this great university        482    00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.860    you are despite the kidding here you are        483    00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.020    the best and the brightest and this        484    00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.970    morning or this afternoon you are also        485    00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:22.350    the object of my enormous jealousy if I        486    00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.870    could trade places with you and go back        487    00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.210    to being 21 years of age I would trade        488    00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.310    with you in a second I would take on the        489    00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.070    challenges I would take on the UPS the        490    00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:34.620    Downs and the heartaches that you will        491    00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.990    undoubtedly face in these coming years        492    00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:39.810    and I would try in some small way to        493    00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.720    change the world you are the best and        494    00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.460    the brightest and I know you will make        495    00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.430    us proud all that stuff I said about not        496    00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.170    wanting to work with you it was bluster        497    00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:51.810    I would be happy to work with you and at        498    00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.360    the very least I will be standing on the        499    00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.540    sidelines cheering wildly you are the        500    00:21:57.540 -->

dreamt it would        39    00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.130    seem sometimes too so only doubts about        40    00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.570    whether we might in fact be the        41

it is here that we began to        63    00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.610    learn that most important kind of        64    00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:10.080    Veritas the truth about who we are as we

loftiest institutions can        70    00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.120    fail and the surest experts can be wrong        71    00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.760    and that their hubristic certainty is        72    00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.120    often part of the problem and if the        73    00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.220    crisis has induced numerous sleepless        74    00:03:32.220 -->

"May 11, 2010",commencement,video,9T9Kp4NE5l4,"Jamie Dimon:  Address to HBS MBA Class of 2009, Class Day June 21, 2009","James ""Jamie"" Dimon (MBA 1982), chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co., who has been listed by the Financial Times as one of the leaders most likely to lead the world out of the financial crisis, offered wide-ranging words of wisdom and advice to members of the Harvard Business School MBA Class of 2009 at Class Day exercises on the HBS campus. Also attending were family members, friends, and other guests of the almost 900 graduating students.        Focusing first on career management, Dimon reminded the class of the importance of lifelong learning and building a reputation-a personal brand-for hard work, integrity, and trust, among other qualities. In a sense, he said, a book is put together about each of us as we go through life, and ""you can choose the way you want the book to be written.""        As leaders face the challenges and opportunities of life, he continued, emotional intelligence is as important as brain power. ""IQ alone won't get you through tough times."" A dose of toughness was also part of the prescription Dimon proposed. People in positions of responsibility are bound to take some heat along life's way, he noted, quoting Theodore Roosevelt's observation that players are the ones who are criticized, not the spectators in the stands. He also underscored the importance of maintaining work-life balance. When it comes to family, he said, there is no such thing as quality time without an equal amount of quantity.        Moving on to the leadership of organizations both big and small, Dimon noted first the sense of responsibility he felt as a CEO: ""If I make a mistake, I can hurt a lot of people,"" he said, from the bank's employees to its stockholders and stakeholders. He then discussed the wide array of attributes that every leader needs:        - Self-discipline, a work ethic, and a dedication to continuous improvement    - Fortitude and a penchant for action    - The ability to set high standards of performance and integrity. ""Compare yourself to the best,"" he advised, ""and treat other people the way you treat your parents. Do the right thing, not the expedient thing.""    - Analytical skills that take a hard, honest look at all the facts, including ""things we're not doing well.""    - A willingness to share information with others and to use it as the basis for making the right decision. For that to happen, everyone a leader works with should feel free to engage in open, uninhibited conversations and discussions. ""Have many truth tellers around you, not just one.""    - A sense of the importance of loyalty, meritocracy, and teamwork in the context of the success of the entire organization. If someone is not doing the job, loyalty to organization trumps loyalty to the individual, Dimon explained.    - A feel for a firm's morale - something that can be severely damaged by organizational bureaucracy and politics    - Respect for everyone at every level, from the CEO on down    - A skill set that can ""get compensation right"" based on hard work and contributions to the company, including helping other employees. Long-term deals for CEOs and other top executives don't pass muster with Dimon (""I shouldn't have to bribe you to join us.""), nor do compensation programs that automatically penalize failure. Leaders should be able to adjust for the fact that a person tried but ended up being wrong, he said.    - A sense of humility, based on the acknowledgement that no one rises to a leadership position without the help of others, beginning with one's parents.        The final portion of Dimon's remarks dealt with the leader's obligations to companies and society. JPMorgan is a ""caring company,"" he said. ""We give away $100 million a year, we pay the salaries of employees who have been called to military service, we send money and aid when disasters strike around the world,"" but at the same time, Dimon pointed out, ""all these good deeds are predicated on the fact that my colleagues and I keep JP Morgan healthy and vibrant. Success is not a given.""        Dimon urged the HBS graduates-to-be to play a role in helping make effective public policies that contribute to spreading wealth, not destroying it. There is a great need to make the planet better, he said. On the other hand, current energy policy, he believes, skirts the one solution that will work, namely taxation, and half the children in US inner cities don't graduate from high school. Much needs to be done in these and other realms. ""I hope that I'm leading my life in such a way so that when I'm gone, people will say that the world is a better place for my having been here,"" he concluded.",Harvard Business School,"https://www.youtube.com/api/timedtext?v=9T9Kp4NE5l4&ei=avvcZuGtGZDlzN0P8aDu0AY&caps=asr&opi=112496729&exp=xbt&xoaf=5&hl=en&ip=0.0.0.0&ipbits=0&expire=1725783514&sparams=ip,ipbits,expire,v,ei,caps,opi,exp,xoaf&signature=80B01FBC5C96B31AEC2C86669894EC8FE67AD9C6.9162BBF0B948B66FFDFC31902A3B02CDF27FFB42&key=yt8&kind=asr&lang=en",en,1

00:01:28.799    uh we didn't have any of that stuff we        34    00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.960    were right down to business and um Dean        35    00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.680    light Joe

00:01:43.920    but the year that I was here was his        41    00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.399    first year and we taught him how to        42    00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.840    teach so uh I'm

did it it is a well- earned you should        53    00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.120    feel great about graduating this school        54    00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.680    it is well learned it's not just the two        55    00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.120    years here is years of hard work it does        56    00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.599    come with some very very deep        57    00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.280    obligations going to talk about a little        58    00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.400    bit later I'm actually to stick to        59    00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.920    exactly what that you all ask me to        60    00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.239    speak about three subjects one was        61    00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.480    career management learning dealing with        62    00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.519    failure building your brand is one it        63    00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.760    was it was put in the piece of paper I        64    00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.560    got uh family and things like that the        65    00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.120    second is leadership qualities of        66    00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.760    leadership what's important and        67    00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.840    particularly lessons in a crisis and the        68    00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.840    third is our obligations uh to society        69    00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.640    and each other I'm going to caution you        70    00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.760    and I'm going to go through a bunch of        71    00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.680    things here I'm always hesitant to give        72    00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.239    advice because it sounds like I did it        73    00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.239    all right I did not someone I'm going to        74    00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.760    tell you is I learned from making the        75    00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.319    mistakes that I'm going to tell you to        76    00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.599    try to avoid doing and some are Timeless        77    00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.959    principles I'm sure a lot of the parents        78    00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.000    here will will U will know them quite        79    00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.920    well career        80    00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.440    management and this is individual        81    00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.720    whether you're an individual leader or a        82    00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.000    leader of a group an individual        83    00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.440    contributor uh you're responsible for        84    00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.879    your own success and happiness there are        85    00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.319    six very important things I think you        86    00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.200    got to focus on learning is a lifelong        87    00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.280    thing it doesn't end at Harvard Business        88    00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.439    School it's your respons ability I think        89    00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.680    if you're in any profession at all you        90    00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.840    have to do it consistently all the time        91    00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.920    I think I spend probably 50 or 60% of my        92    00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.959    time learning reading talking to people        93    00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.319    traveling it's the only way you can keep        94    00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.760    uh on top of this Global world of ours        95    00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.720    and it's even tougher now because of the        96    00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.480    globality of the businesses you're all        97    00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.080    going to deal in how reading is the most        98    00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.159    important one but the second one which        99    00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.120    is often forgotten is talking to other        100    00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.120    people you can learn more from speaking        101    00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.200    to people in 15 minutes than if you your        102    00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.879    life doing something they can explain it        103    00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.959    to you uh and you can learn from        104    00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.519    watching people you also are going to        105    00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.959    learn by uh uh I'm going to call it        106    00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.920    imitation but by watching other very        107    00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.959    good people and how they operate in        108    00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.360    difficult circumstances I learned a lot        109    00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.359    of things with not to do and allow would        110    00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.639    would to do by watching other people        111    00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.280    number two building your brand that's        112    00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.400    it's a Harvard Business School way to        113    00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.680    put it but let me put it a slightly        114    00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.800    different way there is already a book on        115    00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.479    you that book is already being written        116    00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:32.919    and if I spoke to your teachers your        117    00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.280    friends your professionals your parents        118    00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.160    I would know whether you're trusted how        119    00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.360    hard you work with your ethical I would        120    00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.320    know so much about you you'd be shocked        121    00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.360    I don't even have to meet you so that        122    00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.560    book is already growing you should you        123    00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.479    write the book you want the way to be        124    00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.039    written you actually have that choice        125    00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.440    and you can do it as you want now        126    00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.840    um don't let others write it and when        127    00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.720    you get caught in situations that you're        128    00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.800    un comfortable I remember I worked at a        129    00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.160    company not far from here and I remember        130    00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.560    I was asked to do something I didn't        131    00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.800    want to do I'm not telling you I'll take        132    00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.840    this advice you can always        133    00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.919    quit it's your responsibility whether        134    00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.880    you accept to do something or not and it        135    00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.919    will be in that book written on you        136    00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.720    three how do you deal a failure making        137    00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.800    mistakes many of you already have dealt        138    00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.280    with some very difficult times so this        139    00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.560    is no different uh than some of you        140    00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.919    already dealt with um when you fail it's        141    00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.280    okay to get the rest it's okay to cry        142    00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.880    it's okay to go home it's okay to blame        143    00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.199    others for a while but eventually you        144    00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.240    have to get over it and move        145    00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.080    on the greatest people have ever walked        146    00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.960    this planet and if I'm talking I'm not        147    00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.800    talking about business people I'm        148    00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.520    talking about people like Nelson Mandela        149    00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.240    and Abe Lincoln constantly had setbacks        150    00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.160    in life and failures constantly it        151    00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.720    happens all the time in business and        152    00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.880    some of your success will be how you        153    00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.720    deal with the failure not how you deal        154    00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.280    with the success when I get introduced I        155    00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.240    always get introduced uh that 1998 I was        156    00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.720    the president of City group and in 2000        157    00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.479    I took over bank one I was fired in 1998        158    00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:10.280    so I went a little bit of experience        159    00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.680    like this and and it's a painful thing        160    00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.280    my boss who had worked for 15 years        161    00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.720    called me in and        162    00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.400    said uh we want you to resign which I        163    00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.759    said        164    00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:24.960    okay I went home I told my wife and        165    00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.520    children I called my wife up and said        166    00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.639    Judy I'm going to tell you something I'm        167

 make sure the kids were fine I went home        170    00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:36.599    I had three wonderful daughters they        171    00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:39.039    were much younger then I

00:06:45.560    streets I said no hun we're okay the        175    00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.280    middle one who just graduated barard        176    00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.680    said dad can I still go to college I        177    00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.120    said Yes dear you can and I knew things        178    00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.840    were fine when the oldest one was going        179    00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.240    to Harvard Business School said dad can        180    00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.840    I have that little cell phone you have        181    00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.160    you won't be needing        182    00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.800    it        183    00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.919    and I remind people when you fail at        184    00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:08.199    something it's your I told people about        185    00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:10.440    City group is my net worth not my        186    00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.720    selfworth and I was able to move on and        187    00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.199    yes it was difficult I did call my boss        188    00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:17.720    a year later he did not call me I called        189    00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.879    him and said it's time to break bread we        190    00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:22.520    went to lunch together uh I told him I        191    00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.560    didn't think you did the right thing for        192    00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.919    City Group which is pretty obvious at        193    00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:27.440    this point        194    00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.879    but but I told him the mistakes I made        195    00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:34.319    and whether it was 40 60 or 6040 wasn't        196    00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:36.360    important I wanted to learn from the        197    00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.120    experience uh and move on he he        198    00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.879    acknowledged my mistakes        199    00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.520    um you had better be a little tough in        200    00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.800    this world of        201    00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.159    ours uh because you will be criticized        202    00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:53.199    when you take jobs of leadership and        203    00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:55.039    almost any job and so you have to grow a        204    00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:57.199    little bit of a thick skin at one point        205    00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:58.919    when secretary Hank Paulson Secretary of        206    00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:00.840    treas United States was getting a lot of        207    00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.759    criticism and Tim gider about some of        208    00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:04.919    the things they're doing in a very        209    00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:06.599    difficult environment I called them up        210    00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:08.400    and read them a Teddy Roosevelt quote        211    00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.000    which I hope you should all remember        212    00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.120    took all the students here and it it was        213    00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.520    something like the following that the        214    00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.639    credit does not go to the critic in the        215    00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:19.560    stand it goes to the person on the field        216    00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.240    blooded and bruised striving to achieve        217    00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.520    something and I think that that's very        218    00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.319    true so that when you get the criticism        219    00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:28.199    Let It Go off your back and I think we        220    00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:29.720    should remind ourselves when it come to        221    00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.039    mistakes a lot of what's going to happen        222    00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.399    in the next 25 years to you it's not        223    00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:37.279    just your skill there's luck involved so        224    00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:39.039    don't get too exuberant when you do well        225    00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.200    and don't get too depressed when you        226    00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.760    don't number four to thine own self be        227    00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.279    true you have to fight        228    00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:49.560    self-deception we are human beings are        229    00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.040    experts at it I do it all the time it's        230    00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.680    one of my favorite things to do until        231    00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.480    people bring me back to Earth very often        232    00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.839    who brings you back to Earth very often        233    00:08:57.839 --> 00:08:59.640    it's your friends your spouse we all do        234    00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.920    the same kind of thing with friends and        235    00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.160    spouses we come home we tell them how we        236    00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.839    were treated and why that person treated        237    00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:09.399    us so badly and they agree with us so        238    00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:11.000    it's very important you try to step out        239    00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.680    of those situations and uh try to un        240    00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.200    yourself deeply I'm going to give you        241    00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.000    two examples about this is more personal        242    00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.320    it may relate to some of you here about        243    00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.560    myself when I was in fifth        244    00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.200    grade my teacher made a sign that said        245    00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.440    self-control and she put it on the desk        246    00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.360    facing        247    00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.279    me that went on for many many years and        248    00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:34.440    it wasn't until I was 45 years old that        249    00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.839    I realized that anger is a bad        250    00:09:37.839 --> 00:09:40.240    thing and that people used to say when I        251    00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.519    was younger that was a well-placed blow        252    00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:44.959    of anger well timed and well delivered        253    00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.560    it was never deliberate it was just a        254    00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.760    welling up of anger you usually I had to        255    00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.720    apologize in fact at one point someone        256    00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.480    gave me a box of cards which all I had        257    00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.959    to do was fill in the day and the card        258    00:09:56.959 --> 00:09:59.440    said hello my name is Jamie Diamond i'        259    00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.360    like to apologize in advance for my        260    00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.279    behavior on the day of X and so anger        261    00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:07.440    always backfires it hurts people you        262    00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.440    have to apologize all the time it's        263    00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.640    better to skip it        264    00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:17.360    um you all know about IQ and EQ your IQs        265    00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.000    are all high enough to be very        266    00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.640    successful where people often fall short        267    00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.200    it's on the EQ and emotional        268    00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.720    intelligence is critical and it's        269    00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.800    something you will develop over time too        270    00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.959    M matter of fact a lot of management        271    00:10:30.959 --> 00:10:33.240    skills are more EQ how do people        272    00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.600    function and when I look at EQ I always        273    00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.480    think to myself why is it that when some        274    00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.519    people walk in a room we all brighten up        275    00:10:40.519 --> 00:10:41.800    why is it when you really want advice        276    00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.000    you call certain people why is it that        277    00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.320    some people you never would question        278    00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.000    what they say and that some people you        279    00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.920    never would trust what they say and        280    00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.000    those are emotional skills and empathy        281    00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000    and but you're a human being you have        282    00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.600    these other things which we all have to        283    00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.839    develop all the time and work at them        284    00:11:01.839 --> 00:11:03.279    all the time and there things like        285    00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:07.360    passion work ethic character integrity        286    00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.760    and you're the sum of all of these        287    00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.200    things your IQ alone will not get you        288    00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.320    through the dark days or the tough times        289    00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.920    you need to develop all these things to        290    00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.560    develop them consistently take care of        291    00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.920    yourself your family and your friends        292    00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.600    you're going to get involved in a very        293    00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.480    high stressful situations if you don't C        294    00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.200    care yourself physically and emotionally        295    00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.399    you will        296    00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:30.839    fail you have to do it I used to feel        297    00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:32.800    guilty when I get in the office late        298    00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.440    Sometimes Late being 8:30 or 9 cuz I        299    00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.680    stayed to        300    00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.040    exercise exercise is a good thing it        301    00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.160    clears your mind you have to give        302    00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.279    yourself vacations and family time all        303    00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:44.279    the        304    00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:47.639    time one example I had I went on        305    00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:49.360    vacation many years ago like a lot of        306    00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.279    you I played tennis in the morning with        307    00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:52.680    friends I ran the afternoon we had        308    00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.399    dinner with friends and my kids were        309    00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:57.040    kind of ignoring me that whole vacation        310    00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.040    and the next one vacation I said no I'm        311    00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.120    going going to go I'm going to spend        312    00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.920    only with the kids nothing else no        313    00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.240    friends no tennis and it's amazing how        314    00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.920    much fun you have and how much time you        315    00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.240    play with them there is no such thing as        316    00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.680    quality time without quantity so when        317    00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.079    you have children don't think you can        318    00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:16.079    make up for with a short briefs of        319    00:12:16.079 --> 00:12:17.880    quantity time they won't they won't get        320    00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.760    there with        321    00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.839    you leadership it's quite issue number        322    00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.320    two first of all it is an honor a        323    00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.839    privilege and a very deep responsibility        324    00:12:31.839 --> 00:12:33.920    to be a leader of a small group or a        325    00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.279    bigger group you have to remind yourself        326    00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:40.199    if you make a mistake and I worry about        327    00:12:40.199 --> 00:12:42.839    this all the time I can hurt a lot of        328    00:12:42.839 --> 00:12:44.480    people and I'm not talking about just        329    00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.399    shareholders I'm talking about customers        330    00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:49.560    communities employees parents we have to        331    00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.920    lay off people so that's what I worry        332    00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.560    about every single day it is personal I        333    00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.920    hear all the time that people say it's        334    00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.519    not personal it's just business it is        335    00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:02.000    personal I want to do a great job for        336    00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.240    this company this team I bleed JP Morgan        337    00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.680    blood I don't like it when people act I        338    00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.440    see this all the time like it's a third        339    00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.680    party they're talking about it is not a        340    00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.399    third party I wear the jersey of this        341    00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:17.600    company I want Patriots I want people        342    00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.160    going to fight for it and do the right        343    00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.000    thing all the        344    00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.240    time do what it's not what you say I'm        345    00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.560    going to say a lot of things here it's        346    00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.800    actually what you do so everything I'm        347    00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.639    about to say it's whether you actually        348    00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:31.240    demonstrated in your life not whether        349    00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.480    you put it down in paper I'm going to go        350    00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.360    through 11 attributes the attributes are        351    00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.720    intertwined you can come up with        352    00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.240    different names in different ways uh the        353    00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.959    only difference in the crisis by the way        354    00:13:40.959 --> 00:13:42.680    is which ones are more important the        355    00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.880    balance changes but you need all of        356    00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.040    these to do a very good job as a leader        357    00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.720    you have to be very disciplined I was        358    00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.720    not that disciplined I I didn't work as        359    00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.920    hard as my wife here and I was a little        360    00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.639    lazy and but when I started working uh        361    00:13:57.639 --> 00:13:59.560    you have to be disciplined disp is        362    00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.079    rigorous detailed meetings you do it        363    00:14:02.079 --> 00:14:04.000    consistently you have to have a work        364    00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.279    ethic it's like exercising or weeding        365    00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:08.920    the garden you don't get there and stop        366    00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.600    and the competition is always coming        367    00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.079    down it's continuous Improvement you        368    00:14:13.079 --> 00:14:15.480    have to always be striving for        369    00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.160    improvement discipline in a crisis by        370    00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.920    the way we would go from once a week RIS        371    00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.160    meeting to three times a day and from        372    00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.240    you know 10hour days to 20h hour days        373    00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.600    that was the only difference but the        374    00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.600    process I'm going talking about a little        375    00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.959    bit is the same        376    00:14:29.959 --> 00:14:31.600    you have to have great fortitude I don't        377    00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.079    know who wrote the book but they talked        378    00:14:33.079 --> 00:14:35.680    about Fierce resolve you have to have        379    00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.720    fortitude and the ability to act you can        380    00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.639    be crippled by politics bureaucracy and        381    00:14:41.639 --> 00:14:44.040    people who just don't want change when I        382    00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.560    first got to bank one it was quickly        383    00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.320    clear to me the company had systems        384    00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.759    problems management problems we didn't        385    00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:51.560    treat our customers well our expenses        386    00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.279    were too high and to survive and thrive        387    00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:55.720    we're going to lay up a lot of people        388    00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.920    the board didn't want to make the        389    00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.360    changes the management didn't want to        390    00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.880    make the changes benefic the management        391    00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.600    said wasn't my fault I don't know who        392    00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.199    else's fault it        393    00:15:04.199 --> 00:15:07.639    was you have to push back against it at        394    00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:09.880    one point I cut the size of the board I        395    00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.240    went to the management team we cut 100%        396    00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.079    of their bonuses the first year we took        397    00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:16.199    away their pension plans their cars        398    00:15:16.199 --> 00:15:18.079    their clubs I made a lot of them go with        399    00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:20.120    me to every site we're laying off people        400    00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.240    and say we're sorry that we put you in a        401    00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.680    position that we have to lay off people        402    00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.360    at this company you have to have the        403    00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.360    ability to act you've got to make a list        404    00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.399    of what it is and then get it done yes        405    00:15:31.399 --> 00:15:34.160    orchestrate it coordinate it don't do it        406    00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.120    in haste think it through cuz that will        407    00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.839    backfire too but for the most part        408    00:15:38.839 --> 00:15:43.360    people simply don't do what needs to be        409    00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.600    done you have to set standards standards        410    00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.040    are not set by Harvard Business School        411    00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.079    they're not set by the federal        412    00:15:49.079 --> 00:15:50.360    governments of the world they're not set        413    00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.199    by anybody not set by Industries they're        414    00:15:52.199 --> 00:15:54.199    set by you there are two types of        415    00:15:54.199 --> 00:15:57.160    Standards you have to set first one is        416    00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.480    performance if you want to really be        417    00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.639    good you have to say it you have to say        418    00:16:01.639 --> 00:16:03.480    we want to be good and we strive to be        419    00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.000    among the best you have to compare        420    00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.880    yourself to the best a lot of companies        421    00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.319    I go to when we compare ourselves they        422    00:16:08.319 --> 00:16:10.800    always drop the best company I always        423    00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.959    say why is that they said the best        424    00:16:11.959 --> 00:16:13.240    company's different They Don't Really        425    00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.160    compete in the same business I say yeah        426    00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.600    they're different they're        427    00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.959    good put the best up there at a very        428    00:16:18.959 --> 00:16:21.120    detailed level and say we want to do it        429    00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.560    analyze why you're        430    00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.279    different that includes in performance        431    00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:27.319    give the customer a great deal if you're        432    00:16:27.319 --> 00:16:28.519    not giving the customer a good deal        433    00:16:28.519 --> 00:16:31.360    you're going to lose link someone said        434    00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.319    things come to those who wait Abe        435    00:16:33.319 --> 00:16:35.720    Lincoln added yes but only those things        436    00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.440    that are left by those who        437    00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.839    hustle you have to set standards of        438    00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:41.959    performance or you will fail the second        439    00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.160    is standards of        440    00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.680    Integrity I know you talk about it and        441    00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.680    you'll learn it treat people the way you        442    00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.199    would treat your parents that's all tell        443    00:16:51.199 --> 00:16:53.120    them the product tell them the service        444    00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.519    when they come in the door say what can        445    00:16:54.519 --> 00:16:56.560    I do for you my parents were here they'        446    00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.120    say you should be treating me a little        447    00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.440    bit better Jamie but        448    00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.120    uh but set the standards of Integrity        449    00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.039    it's not embedded in anything a lot of        450    00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:06.319    you worked at companies where people        451    00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.880    said things it's I think it's a code        452    00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.640    word is don't worry about it everyone        453    00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.959    does it that way no they don't no they        454    00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:13.839    do        455    00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:16.559    not and you know set that standard and        456    00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:17.760    that standard has got to be set at a        457    00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.360    very all across all levels I've been        458    00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.199    with a lot of kids who lie on tnes        459    00:17:23.199 --> 00:17:24.799    because they took a cab in they shared        460    00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:27.039    it from the hotel you know to the to a        461    00:17:27.039 --> 00:17:28.319    job interview they split it with a        462    00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.160    friend and they both put in 100% of the        463    00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.080    care bill of $40 that's stealing if I        464    00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.679    caught you doing that I'd fire you and        465    00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:37.120    everyone in the company knows that that        466    00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.080    is stealing and so the standard is set        467    00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.080    across the board from little things to        468    00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.559    big things do the right thing not the        469    00:17:43.559 --> 00:17:46.280    easy or expedient thing        470    00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.679    fourth you got to look at the facts in a        471    00:17:48.679 --> 00:17:50.520    coldblooded honest        472    00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.600    way all the time at management meetings        473    00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.480    emphasize the negatives you can always        474    00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.080    have a party about the positives I used        475    00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.080    to always go to Hong Kong party have a        476    00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.720    great time but in management meetings        477    00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.520    what are we not doing well how come the        478    00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.640    competition is doing better emphasize        479    00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.200    the negatives internally P profit and        480    00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.520    loss statements are very important okay        481    00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.159    and so a lot of times I get involved in        482    00:18:12.159 --> 00:18:14.000    debates about well you're focusing on        483    00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.559    Little Things how we allocate expenses        484    00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:18.200    it's not a little thing a lot of        485    00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.120    companies expense allocate expenses        486    00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.919    inside and the allocation is political        487    00:18:22.919 --> 00:18:24.440    not        488    00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.559    economic and you that that does two        489    00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:27.840    things inside a company it means your        490    00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.679    numbers aren't honest in fact I've been        491    00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:31.520    at a company where people say well let's        492    00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.760    move the profits to the part of the        493    00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.840    company has a higher public        494    00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.600    valuation I call that Financial        495    00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.320    misrepresentation you're teaching your        496    00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.840    own people to lie and that goes on in        497    00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.520    these companies so pnls are very        498    00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.440    important that way aggressive accounting        499    00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.600    is the same thing I'm not going to go        500    00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.760    through a lot of examples I know I don't        501    00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.360    know if you still that GE case and the        502    00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.559    westing house case Compares did you        503    00:18:53.559 --> 00:18:54.960    still do that one that compares        504    00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.559    accounting when people do very        505    00:18:56.559 --> 00:18:58.200    aggressive accounting you it's in one        506    00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.320    spot it's a lot of spots it tells you        507    00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.200    something about the company so keep your        508    00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.720    eye out for that one externally full        509    00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.200    disclosure there's only one truth we try        510    00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.039    to tell the board the same thing we tell        511    00:19:09.039 --> 00:19:10.880    the employees the same thing we tell the        512    00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.240    analysts the same thing we tell our        513    00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.760    employees The Good the Bad and the Ugly        514    00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.000    and then deal with it it's okay we're        515    00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.559    never going to do everything exactly        516    00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:22.280    right number five openness Hard One to        517    00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.360    actually execute because what you really        518    00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.200    want a company is full sharing of        519    00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.559    information I've worked a lot of        520    00:19:27.559 --> 00:19:28.840    companies where you can't simply can't        521    00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.679    get it you know they say it's not your        522    00:19:30.679 --> 00:19:33.200    job it is your job we want to have full        523    00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.200    information and then have a debate about        524    00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.840    the right thing to do half the debate on        525    00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.000    what the information is bad information        526    00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.360    leads to excessive        527    00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.520    politics people have often said to me        528    00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.760    okay Jamie you're the big boss you get        529    00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.960    paid the big bucks to decide now        530    00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.559    decide my experience has always been        531    00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:52.960    that if you get the right people in the        532    00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.000    room the answer is often waiting to be        533    00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.200    found you don't have to guess the job of        534    00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.440    a leader is not to make the decision is        535    00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.640    to make sure the best decision is made        536    00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.520    and therefore you need other people you        537    00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.760    have to kill bureaucracy I think that        538    00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.760    bureaucracy is a is the petri dish of        539    00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.120    politics it pushes out good people you        540    00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.120    lose touch with your customers it often        541    00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.039    emanates from headquarters if you go to        542    00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:16.720    headquarters of companies I think        543    00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.559    headquarters are often the disease and        544    00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:20.880    you see the receptionist treating the        545    00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.520    employees badly or their customers badly        546    00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.039    you probably have a company that has a        547    00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:29.320    problem headquarters don't exist except        548    00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.840    the fact there's a client in front of        549    00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.679    someone somewhere whether it's a Benny        550    00:20:32.679 --> 00:20:35.120    Hana or whether it's a JP Morgan Chase        551    00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.520    and uh you got to        552    00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.440    deal My Home Depot the best example is        553    00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.320    they call store support center I'm more        554    00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.559    of that mind move people in and out of        555    00:20:43.559 --> 00:20:44.559    corporate to make sure they know it's        556    00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:46.720    like to have the job on the firing line        557    00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.159    and then they have a little more respect        558    00:20:48.159 --> 00:20:50.679    for the job in the firing line deal with        559    00:20:50.679 --> 00:20:52.240    key issues I always make a list on        560    00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.039    Sunday of all the issues I'm trying to        561    00:20:54.039 --> 00:20:56.400    avoid and I write them down and I try to        562    00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.799    deal with them on Monday I avoid them        563    00:20:58.799 --> 00:20:59.960    half the time come with good reasons not        564    00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.679    to do it but but I TR try to get them uh        565    00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:05.120    down there are signs of uh politics when        566    00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.440    you see these I'm sure you've all seen        567    00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.360    them when you have a meeting you share        568    00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.760    information and after the meeting people        569    00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.880    line up outside of your office saying I        570    00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.120    didn't want to say this in front of        571    00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.279    everybody        572    00:21:14.279 --> 00:21:17.880    but that's politics now of course they        573    00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.799    can tell you something confidential but        574    00:21:19.799 --> 00:21:21.320    most of the time it should has been said        575    00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.720    in the room with their Partners I tend        576    00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.440    to tell people you can't say in the room        577    00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.400    you don't deserve the job say it        578    00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.679    politely say it reason ably but say it        579    00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:30.640    because we're only trying to do the        580    00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.679    right thing for the company or the        581    00:21:32.679 --> 00:21:35.400    clients one point we had a conversation        582    00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.799    about compensation we actually reviewed        583    00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:39.919    the top compensation a lot of people and        584    00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:41.120    soone said you're going to make us all        585    00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.720    go through all the compensation of all        586    00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.720    the top people I said yes I am and the        587    00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.880    person said well don't they work for me        588    00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.720    don't I know what they contribute to the        589    00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.600    company I said no they don't work for        590    00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.799    you and how do you know what they        591    00:21:51.799 --> 00:21:53.799    contribute to the company un unless you        592    00:21:53.799 --> 00:21:56.240    ask your partners and we have open        593    00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.760    conversations about whether our people        594    00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.480    doing a good job for each other we don't        595    00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.480    do it to hurt anyone we do it for        596    00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.880    fairness and insight and is get into the        597    00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.120    field whatever people say get into the        598    00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.120    field do it all the time have a little        599    00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.840    fun take the Ops clerk to dinner go have        600    00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.559    drinks with the tellers you'll learn        601    00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:16.279    more about your company all the time you        602    00:22:16.279 --> 00:22:18.840    do something like that cut across        603    00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.919    hierarchy when you're in companies that        604    00:22:20.919 --> 00:22:23.400    hierarchy is another disease be        605    00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.760    polite but hierarchy generally        606    00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.760    artificial to start with most units and        607    00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.880    companies all serve each other and so        608    00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.080    cut across the hierarchy just make sure        609    00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.000    your boss doesn't fire you for it        610    00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.200    um always get the right people in the        611    00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.679    room if you're designing a system have        612    00:22:39.679 --> 00:22:42.400    the people going to use the system there        613    00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.640    give them the authority to say if it if        614    00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.880    this do it doesn't work for you the        615    00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.039    tellers or the clerks then we won't do        616    00:22:48.039 --> 00:22:50.600    it so they get fully engaged in building        617    00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.159    everything that the company does all the        618    00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:54.440    time and the last thing to open this        619    00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.400    someone said to me once you know there's        620    00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.240    truth tellers someone stood up in a big        621    00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.200    crowd and said every every one of you        622    00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.679    has to make sure that one at least one        623    00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:02.799    of the people around you is a truth        624    00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:05.880    teller they always tell you the truth        625    00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.559    and I got up and said yes you got to        626    00:23:07.559 --> 00:23:08.760    make sure that there's at least one        627    00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.720    truth tell around you but if you are a        628    00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.480    leader and you have seven or eight        629    00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.159    people reporting to you and you have        630    00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:17.679    only one truth teller you have a problem        631    00:23:17.679 --> 00:23:19.480    every single one of them should be a        632    00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.480    truth        633    00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.679    teller you have to set things up for        634    00:23:22.679 --> 00:23:25.480    Success you a quick example from my past        635    00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.960    when we did the city group Travelers        636    00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.679    deal we had multiple Triads and multiple        637    00:23:29.679 --> 00:23:31.640    co-heads reporting to Triads and        638    00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:35.279    co-heads that is a formula for        639    00:23:35.279 --> 00:23:37.559    disaster so organize things will        640    00:23:37.559 --> 00:23:39.159    actually work in the future not things        641    00:23:39.159 --> 00:23:41.520    that won't work in the future loyalty        642    00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.720    number seven loyalty meritocracy and        643    00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.760    teamwork words you all here I'm going to        644    00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.159    give you a slightly different point of        645    00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:50.120    view of them when I was a young CEO        646    00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.240    someone asked        647    00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.559    me we love the company but you demoted        648    00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:59.120    Joe you embarrassed him        649    00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.880    how can we be loyal to you which we        650    00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.240    which we ask for which I believe in when        651    00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.480    we're not loyal to Joe and I honestly        652    00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.880    couldn't answer the question and I went        653    00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.640    home that night and I thought about it        654    00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.039    and I called the person up the next day        655    00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:13.960    I said yes you were right we demoted Joe        656    00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.720    and Joe is a pillar of society and a        657    00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.039    wonderful person and yes we did not want        658    00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:20.600    to embarrass him but Joe was no longer        659    00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.000    doing a good        660    00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.880    job if we were quote loyal to Joe by        661    00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.320    leaving in that job we would have been        662    00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.320    hugely disloyal to everybody else and        663    00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.640    the clients of the company and that by        664    00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.360    the way is the hardest job you are going        665    00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.720    to face right there doing the right        666    00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.360    thing when it may be removed don't        667    00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.240    embarrass someone I think it's one of        668    00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.960    the great mistakes when people embarrass        669    00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.720    people all the time publicly who' worked        670    00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.960    hard for a company that is a terrible        671    00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.039    thing to do um if        672    00:24:50.039 --> 00:24:53.200    you if you are loyal to Joe and not the        673    00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.600    company you do not have a meritocracy I        674    00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.240    remind people we talk about diversity        675    00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.640    Joe is usually a middle-aged white        676    00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.880    guy so if I tell you we're going to give        677    00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.360    the best job to the best person okay I'm        678    00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.080    not telling the truth if you don't see        679    00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.159    me make changes so a meritocracy is the        680    00:25:09.159 --> 00:25:11.760    fundamental part of a meritocracy and        681    00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.200    teamwork teamwork is often code and it        682    00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.120    means get along whereas often I think        683    00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.880    the best team player is the one who puts        684    00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.080    up the hair and says I don't agree        685    00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.600    because I don't think you're doing is in        686    00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.760    the best interest of the client or the        687    00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.559    company so teamwork sometimes means        688    00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:29.360    standing alone and Having the courage to        689    00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.799    say        690    00:25:30.799 --> 00:25:35.159    something I deeply believe in loyalty        691    00:25:35.159 --> 00:25:38.159    deeply I dealt hard with a contradiction        692    00:25:38.159 --> 00:25:40.240    about making tough decisions like that        693    00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.480    so what is loyalty if you deeply believe        694    00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.679    in it what do we owe employees of a        695    00:25:44.679 --> 00:25:46.640    company and each other here's what we        696    00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.480    owe you we owe you I'm going to talk        697    00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.360    about this a little B later that we're        698    00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.279    going to build

00:26:01.480    respected we want to give you the        704    00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.880    training you need we want to treat you        705    00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.200    with dignity we

--> 00:26:12.360    you that's what we owe you we do not owe        709    00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:17.399    you that job and that is what Loyalty        710    00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.320    means number eight great mistakes are        711    00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.000    name made in the name of morale very        712    00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.559    often morale that people means writing        713    00:26:24.559 --> 00:26:25.720    down words we're going to treat people        714    00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.880    with dignity and loyalty we're going to        715    00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.799    do all these wonderful things we're        716    00:26:27.799 --> 00:26:29.480    going to hold hand and sing        717    00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.919    Kumbaya The Road to Hell of pays with        718    00:26:31.919 --> 00:26:35.279    good intentions one of my first jobs I        719    00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:37.960    was at a company I go and Ma named that        720    00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.880    had a terrible morale problem they spent        721    00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.080    hundred hundreds of thousands of dollars        722    00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.720    in a survey to ask what you know to        723    00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.840    check into moral I of course being a        724    00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.799    little obnoxious at my young age said I        725    00:26:47.799 --> 00:26:49.039    could have saved you the money and told        726    00:26:49.039 --> 00:26:51.039    you morale was bad now morale was bad        727    00:26:51.039 --> 00:26:52.279    because people consider the place        728    00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:56.360    political and bureaucratic St        729    00:26:56.559 --> 00:26:58.880    Define the management team came up with        730    00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.480    an idea the idea was and they convinced        731    00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.640    themselves with a great idea they they        732    00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.120    give every employee $300 of restricted        733    00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.440    stock to show that they care and to give        734    00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.880    them a vested interest in the company        735    00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.600    they gave out the $300 of restricted        736    00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.000    stock months later they in they surveyed        737    00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.240    morale again it got worse and I'm going        738    00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.120    to make a very simple Common Sense        739    00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.080    example of why it got worse and this is        740    00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.080    business is just common sense sometimes        741    00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.080    if you walk up to me and say Jamie your        742    00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.240    company is political and bureaucratic I        743    00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.480    don't like working here I would never        744    00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.480    recommend have a friend come here I look        745    00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.520    back and say oh yeah well here's 300        746    00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.080    bucks what you want us to do is fix the        747    00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.000    problem we can't buy your loyalty and we        748    00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.240    certainly can't buy your morale morale        749    00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.000    comes from fixing problems earning        750    00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.080    respect and winning I always remind        751    00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.000    people show me a very bad company that        752    00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.080    loses all the time I'll show you bad        753    00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:53.200    morale number nine treat all people        754    00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.360    properly with respect treat them all the        755    00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.200    same whether they're clerks or CEOs I        756    00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.360    find it very upsetting I someone must        757    00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.480    mentioned yes Jamie that's true but you        758    00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.559    treat them all badly sometimes but don't        759    00:28:03.559 --> 00:28:05.720    treat them well but treat them        760    00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.960    equally        761    00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.000    uh everyone serves everyone else in a        762    00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.799    company from that receptionist to that        763    00:28:12.799 --> 00:28:14.960    teller to the Ops person and we should        764    00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.919    always acknowledge that we serve people        765    00:28:16.919 --> 00:28:18.519    if we don't return our phone calls        766    00:28:18.519 --> 00:28:20.519    they're not going to return theirs so I        767    00:28:20.519 --> 00:28:21.960    always remind myself that anything I'm        768    00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.000    doing for someone is because they have a        769    00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.960    client in front of them promote people        770    00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.159    who respected ask yourself a question        771    00:28:28.159 --> 00:28:30.840    promote people would you have your child        772    00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.039    work for that        773    00:28:33.039 --> 00:28:35.440    person because half the time we promote        774    00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.679    people we would not let our kid work for        775    00:28:37.679 --> 00:28:38.840    them and you should really question        776    00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.000    about why you would allow something like        777    00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.360    that number 10 this is one of the Hot        778    00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.080    Topics get compensation        779    00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.240    right so get the incentives right build        780    00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.840    the pnls right get the incentives right        781    00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.000    but I always remind people that our        782    00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.840    company I don't care what the p&l says        783    00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:57.240    or what the incentive system says do the        784    00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.679    right thing for the client anyway that's        785    00:28:59.679 --> 00:29:03.039    never an a bad excuse for bad        786    00:29:03.039 --> 00:29:05.559    behaviors companies even big companies        787    00:29:05.559 --> 00:29:07.720    we need entrepreneurs so we have to        788    00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.880    accommodate thoroughbreds people want to        789    00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.679    make money innovators and so we have to        790    00:29:12.679 --> 00:29:14.600    make sure we comp we have that inside        791    00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.919    our company all the time too to get        792    00:29:16.919 --> 00:29:18.159    compensation right you have to        793    00:29:18.159 --> 00:29:20.919    acknowledge that failure is okay we want        794    00:29:20.919 --> 00:29:22.640    people to fail I think they're good        795    00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.000    mistakes you know you argued it you        796    00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.880    thought it through you you talked to the        797    00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.360    right people and you were wrong and so        798    00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.840    you have to allow        799    00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.960    failure compensation a little bit of a        800    00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.519    partnership internal fairness is often        801    00:29:34.519 --> 00:29:36.559    far more important than anything else        802    00:29:36.559 --> 00:29:40.080    that takes place performance is hard to        803    00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.360    judge all this thing about somehow we        804    00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.679    should have an easy job judging        805    00:29:44.679 --> 00:29:45.760    performance when we judge people's        806    00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:46.960    performance we don't just look at that        807    00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.279    p&l that financial statement is a        808    00:29:49.279 --> 00:29:52.159    snapshot of a point in time that's based        809    00:29:52.159 --> 00:29:54.440    upon decisions and actions taken by a        810    00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.440    lot of people over 10 years we look at        811    00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.279    did you work card did you hire people        812    00:29:59.279 --> 00:30:00.960    did you train people did you do the        813    00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.159    right thing for a client do you help        814    00:30:03.159 --> 00:30:05.799    other people did you build systems when        815    00:30:05.799 --> 00:30:07.399    we ask you to do something like recruit        816    00:30:07.399 --> 00:30:09.200    did you help us or did you not show up        817    00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.519    at some of these recruiting sessions so        818    00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:13.760    we we judge the full spectrum of how        819    00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.960    people perform and then the greatest        820    00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.679    misconception of all is when a unit        821    00:30:17.679 --> 00:30:20.200    doesn't perform don't blame the        822    00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.559    boss I mean don't pay the boss well        823    00:30:23.559 --> 00:30:25.440    sometimes you you want to give your best        824    00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.720    person the worst job I a lot of people        825    00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.399    to go do a job that I know is going to        826    00:30:30.399 --> 00:30:32.519    be the hardest turnaround the meanest        827    00:30:32.519 --> 00:30:33.919    job        828    00:30:33.919 --> 00:30:35.960    247 that they're not going to look good        829    00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.039    doing it and you know I say to them I'm        830    00:30:38.039 --> 00:30:39.240    going to pay you the same as the rest of        831    00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.880    your partners and I've got your back I'm        832    00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.320    not going to allow the politics inside        833    00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.960    hurt you if something goes wrong we're        834    00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.000    all going to get an airplane and come        835    00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.279    help you very often in companies when        836    00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:49.760    there's a problem people go running as        837    00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.600    far and fast as they can in the opposite        838    00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.000    direction whereas when we have problems        839    00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000    we want the good people to run us to say        840    00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.399    I can help and we often protect them on        841    00:30:59.399 --> 00:31:01.519    comp when they do something like that        842    00:31:01.519 --> 00:31:03.760    performance also deeply always ask this        843    00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.240    question has to look at the rising tide        844    00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.399    and the Cycles don't let that fool you        845    00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:10.279    allow you a false sense of security and        846    00:31:10.279 --> 00:31:11.320    that's some of what happened in this        847    00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.679    crisis of ours which I'm not going to go        848    00:31:12.679 --> 00:31:15.440    through here the CEO is the captain of        849    00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.279    the        850    00:31:16.279 --> 00:31:19.120    ship when CEOs are hired sometimes they        851    00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.519    have a guarantee or a buy it or        852    00:31:20.519 --> 00:31:21.960    something like that I think it's very        853    00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.639    short that's okay when I got to bank one        854    00:31:24.639 --> 00:31:26.360    I had a one-year guarantee I'd hire a        855    00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.720    bunch of people one point in the year        856    00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.840    they came to see me and said Jamie we        857    00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.360    can't do the job they had G oneye        858    00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.799    guarantees too I've almost never hired        859    00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:37.279    someone for more money a multi-year        860    00:31:37.279 --> 00:31:39.480    guarantee or a bigger job I don't bribe        861    00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.240    people to join the company if I have to        862    00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.120    bribe you I don't want you you want to        863    00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.919    come build a great company love to have        864    00:31:44.919 --> 00:31:47.639    you here they came to see me and said        865    00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:49.720    we're not going to take our guaranteed        866    00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.279    pay because we can't do what we have to        867    00:31:51.279 --> 00:31:52.679    do and travel around and make these        868    00:31:52.679 --> 00:31:54.639    tough decisions and as they're walking        869    00:31:54.639 --> 00:31:56.120    out they look back at me and said and by        870    00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.200    the way we don't think you should take        871    00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.799    yours either        872    00:31:58.799 --> 00:32:01.159    and I think they were exactly right at        873    00:32:01.159 --> 00:32:02.760    one point you're the captain of the ship        874    00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.000    and it doesn't matter anything other        875    00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.639    than you've got to say I'm part of the        876    00:32:06.639 --> 00:32:08.960    ship and I will be paid with it or not        877    00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.320    you should be the first to pay a price        878    00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.720    number        879    00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.120    11 have real        880    00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.799    humility humility by the way is not a uh        881    00:32:18.799 --> 00:32:20.440    people that say Jamie you don't sound        882    00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.799    hum a lot very humble very often        883    00:32:22.799 --> 00:32:25.399    humility is a deep acknowledgement that        884    00:32:25.399 --> 00:32:28.960    we got here by the D of sometimes where        885    00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.960    we were born who our parents were it        886    00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.799    wasn't all our genius and brains maybe        887    00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:37.480    we could have been in a different place        888    00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.080    with a disease that we couldn't handle        889    00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.279    have you you will have awesome power        890    00:32:42.279 --> 00:32:44.320    that affects people's lives use it        891    00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.159    wisely and be just on it if you do all        892    00:32:47.159 --> 00:32:48.840    this in leadership you can end up with a        893    00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.120    mature company and one of the great        894    00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.919    lessons I learned and there's a book        895    00:32:52.919 --> 00:32:53.880    about everything you want about        896    00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.360    management you learned in Shakespeare I        897    00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.559    don't know if you guys teach that here        898    00:32:56.559 --> 00:32:58.480    but it's true I I look at some of these        899    00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.440    companies and they're more like        900    00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.840    Shakespearean tragedies that you don't        901    00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.360    teach you at Harvard Business School        902    00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.679    where neurosis and politics dominates        903    00:33:05.679 --> 00:33:08.960    inter internally ring read King leer        904    00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.399    that's what it looks like to me half the        905    00:33:10.399 --> 00:33:12.320    time and what you want is a mature        906    00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.679    company and the mature companies and I        907    00:33:14.679 --> 00:33:19.760    can name some Walgreens Toyota Tata noia        908    00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.120    I go around the whole in every business        909    00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.960    they're constantly getting better        910    00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.840    they're constantly getting good people        911    00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.840    they always do the right thing they        912    00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.840    always focus on the customer it's not        913    00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.919    constant German Dr when they change CEOs        914    00:33:32.919 --> 00:33:34.320    the company doesn't blow up 5 years        915    00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.039    later you want a mature company not a        916    00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:39.600    Shakespearean        917    00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.279    tragedy third your obligations are        918    00:33:42.279 --> 00:33:45.799    obligations to our companies and our        919    00:33:45.799 --> 00:33:48.639    societies some of these are my values so        920    00:33:48.639 --> 00:33:51.399    you may very well disagree that's fine        921    00:33:51.399 --> 00:33:53.720    first of all you are very        922    00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.000    lucky just we should all acknowledge        923    00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.960    that Warren Buffett always gives an        924    00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.559    example of a barrel that there are        925    00:33:59.559 --> 00:34:02.159    almost 7 billion people in this planet        926    00:34:02.159 --> 00:34:03.399    and that you know most of the people in        927    00:34:03.399 --> 00:34:05.279    this planet if they can take where they        928    00:34:05.279 --> 00:34:07.120    are or stick their hand in and be        929    00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.720    somebody else would stick the hand and        930    00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:09.839    be somebody        931    00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:12.159    else you can have the in the United        932    00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:13.760    States we open the doors we might have        933    00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.560    three billion people who want to come        934    00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:18.960    here we are very lucky a lot of what        935    00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.480    we're good at we were born with um and        936    00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.800    that gives us deep        937    00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.359    obligations leaders understand that they        938    00:34:28.359 --> 00:34:30.800    didn't build this country I speak to a        939    00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.520    lot of my friends I remind them they        940    00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.599    didn't charge the beach at        941    00:34:34.599 --> 00:34:37.520    Normandy or do the hanvey in a desert in        942    00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.800    Iran or a mountain in        943    00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.760    Iraq so everything they earned they did        944    00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.079    not earn it on their own somebody earned        945    00:34:45.079 --> 00:34:47.520    it before they got here and that should        946    00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.040    be a humbling thing for all leaders if        947    00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.720    you want to be a leader it can't be        948    00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:54.800    about money and it can't be about you        949    00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.200    it's about eventually what you do when        950    00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.920    you when what you leave behind and what        951    00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.800    you did when you walked the planet        952    00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.920    teachers politicians scientists generals        953    00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.920    left this planet better than us and        954    00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.800    someone said I'll tell you what I think        955    00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.359    about it said what would you want in        956    00:35:10.359 --> 00:35:12.720    your Tombstone think about that when you        957    00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.200    become a leader what do you want in your        958    00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.400    Tombstone so here are three of the        959    00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.599    important things to me I was asked once        960    00:35:19.599 --> 00:35:21.960    in China by a reporter what really        961    00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.960    important to you and I started talking        962    00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.440    about the company I said no no what's        963    00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:28.880    important to you is a person and I said        964    00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.079    in this order my        965    00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.839    family Humanity my        966    00:35:36.839 --> 00:35:40.880    country somewhere down here JP        967    00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:45.320    Morgan and I do mean that in that        968    00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:49.200    order and I'm explain why the family you        969    00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.800    brought into this world that the people        970    00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.240    who love you the most you love the most        971    00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.520    uh and I've always spoken about giving        972    00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.560    them uh time the only advice I'm give        973    00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.599    you you have family at all or friends        974    00:35:59.599 --> 00:36:00.839    and this is more to the men than to the        975    00:36:00.839 --> 00:36:03.760    women here turn off the TV you don't        976    00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:04.839    have to have dinner with your buddies        977    00:36:04.839 --> 00:36:05.880    all the        978    00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.119    time your vacations belong to your        979    00:36:08.119 --> 00:36:09.640    family your weekends belong to your        980    00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.839    family you got to do that or you will        981    00:36:11.839 --> 00:36:14.800    lose them and the reason I don't devote        982    00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.839    all my time to my family is because as        983    00:36:16.839 --> 00:36:18.599    you all know your kids eventually don't        984    00:36:18.599 --> 00:36:20.480    want to see you anymore either and they        985    00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.319    all go have their own purpose in life so        986    00:36:23.319 --> 00:36:26.440    I tell people the best that I could do        987    00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.760    the best that I could do I think is        988    00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.960    build this company I run as best as I        989    00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.440    can and it's the best I can do for for        990    00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.760    the country and for Humanity the road to        991    00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.119    hell is paav with good intentions I am        992    00:36:38.119 --> 00:36:40.599    devoted to making JP Morgan a healthy        993    00:36:40.599 --> 00:36:42.680    vibrant company and people ask me what's        994    00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.720    the most important thing to you making        995    00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.560    this company healthy and vibrant I will        996    00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.680    make an enormous sacrifice to do that        997    00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.760    because if I don't do that I'm hurting        998    00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.079    our employees our customers our families        999    00:36:53.079 --> 00:36:55.599    our communities we are a very terrible        1000    00:36:55.599 --> 00:36:58.040    company we give away $100 million a year        1001    00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.800    we pay for our vets when they go over        1002    00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:00.839    when they're called back to duty        1003    00:37:00.839 --> 00:37:02.960    overseas we pay their full salary we        1004    00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.960    invented ATMs for the blind we teach        1005    00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.680    inner city school kids when the        1006    00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.720    hurricane the tsunami the earthquake hit        1007    00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.240    we immediately sent money and Aid and I        1008    00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.880    speak for a lot of companies we are a        1009    00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.640    very good company but it is all        1010    00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.160    predicated on being healthy and vibrant        1011    00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.240    and sometimes people forget that and        1012    00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.920    they let the company become sick and        1013    00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:23.720    then you're hurting all these things so        1014    00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.480    I spent a lot of my time making sure we        1015    00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.400    can do all these wonderful things by        1016    00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.480    making sure the company is healthy and        1017    00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.520    vibrant finally humanity and        1018    00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.800    Country we're going to get through this        1019    00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.319    crisis so I'm not going to talk at all        1020    00:37:39.319 --> 00:37:41.560    about the crisis and I think America is        1021    00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.119    a great play I'm wildly optimistic about        1022    00:37:44.119 --> 00:37:46.599    the future of America it is is still one        1023    00:37:46.599 --> 00:37:48.319    of The Shining lights on this        1024    00:37:48.319 --> 00:37:50.680    planet it has been and it will continue        1025    00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.640    to be but I am deeply troubled by the        1026    00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:57.920    notion that success is a given it is not        1027    00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.319    given and this country has a lot of        1028    00:38:00.319 --> 00:38:02.240    things it has to do and        1029    00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.119    policy policy is something that you're        1030    00:38:04.119 --> 00:38:05.400    all going to have to start to work on to        1031    00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.200    make sure we do things right all the        1032    00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:11.480    time to serve humanity and I'm talking        1033    00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.839    about America but I think it applies to        1034    00:38:12.839 --> 00:38:15.119    all countries we all need to do things        1035    00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:17.200    that make the planet better in the        1036    00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.119    United States for example we have had        1037    00:38:19.119 --> 00:38:21.359    our third energy crisis which is an        1038    00:38:21.359 --> 00:38:23.839    environmental crisis the reason we have        1039    00:38:23.839 --> 00:38:25.560    it is we do not have the fortitude to        1040    00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.040    make decisions that other countries made        1041    00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:30.000    a long time ago to tax energy we come up        1042    00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.119    with a lot of things that aren't going        1043    00:38:31.119 --> 00:38:33.000    to work and the one thing that will work        1044    00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.599    we won't do because we don't have the        1045    00:38:34.599 --> 00:38:36.680    fortitude we in the United States of        1046    00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:38.440    America and I know is true for countries        1047    00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.520    around the world half of the kids who        1048    00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.720    graduate inner city schools half of the        1049    00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.240    kids in inner city schools don't        1050    00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:47.400    graduate high school that is a disgrace        1051    00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.680    and an embarrassment which we're going        1052    00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.480    to have to work hard to fix so I remind        1053    00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.040    people that it's okay to share the        1054    00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.480    wealth I don't mind paying taxes I would        1055    00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.960    mind paying more taxes but I also am        1056    00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.440    very careful as we get involved in these        1057    00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.119    things that we don't destroy the wealth        1058    00:39:02.119 --> 00:39:04.760    by having bad policy bad policy can do        1059    00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.000    that and I think Harvard Business School        1060    00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.760    graduates can spend a lot of time making        1061    00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.040    sure we have very good policy the world        1062    00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.160    needs your help and you did mention it        1063    00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.040    was a defining moment I think it's a        1064    00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.119    defined moment in terms of Politics the        1065    00:39:16.119 --> 00:39:18.599    Middle East America and new president        1066    00:39:18.599 --> 00:39:21.440    United States it is a defined moment but        1067    00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.520    A House Divided doesn't stand so I think        1068    00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.839    we all need to do as much as we can many        1069    00:39:26.839 --> 00:39:28.440    years ago I'll leave you with two last        1070    00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.200    thoughts one last thought and I'll tell        1071    00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.079    you my I want my Tombstone to say many        1072    00:39:33.079 --> 00:39:36.200    years ago I read an article in the paper        1073    00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.319    that was written by Medal of Honor        1074    00:39:38.319 --> 00:39:40.760    winner person run a medal of honor on        1075    00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:44.240    Normandy Beach June 6th        1076    00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.880    1944 and the person said something like        1077    00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.359    the following I wish I could have gotten        1078    00:39:48.359 --> 00:39:49.880    it for this but I only remembered it        1079    00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.560    this morning person said I will never        1080    00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.079    forget that day or the people who died        1081    00:39:55.079 --> 00:39:58.680    by my side I am so proud of them though        1082    00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.880    I don't consider my medal earned by just        1083    00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:04.440    me he said but now I'm 70 years old I'm        1084    00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.280    looking back at my life and I realized        1085    00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.319    the people who deserve a medal are the        1086    00:40:09.319 --> 00:40:12.160    people who for 70 years day in and day        1087    00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:15.040    out were good parents good friends help        1088    00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.440    the sick help make it a better world        1089    00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.000    through thick or thin all the time in        1090    00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.079    little ways and in big ways and that's        1091    00:40:23.079 --> 00:40:24.640    how you are all going to add to this        1092    00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:28.160    planet too so my tombstone actually my        1093    00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.480    not my Tombstone I'm not going sure I'm        1094    00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.839    going to put my Tombstone but I hope        1095    00:40:30.839 --> 00:40:31.800    people        1096    00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.280    say we're going to miss the        1097    00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.760    so and the world is a better place for        1098    00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.560    having been here so thank you        1099    00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.560    congratulations God

   00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.240    I speak to you today as one of 207        2    00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.800    degree candidates from The Graduate        3    00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.360    School of        4    00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.439    Design and as one of 33 degree        5    00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.560    candidates from the Department of        6    00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.160    landscape        7    00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.160    architecture despite the fact that        8    00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.880    Harvard's Department in landscape        9    00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.480    architecture is the oldest at any        10    00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.399    University I found during my time here        11    00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.719    that most people have little idea of        12    00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.559    what we study no I haven't learned much        13    00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.360    about avantgard lawn mowing techniques        14    00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.440    here but there are two topics of recent        15    00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.920    interest that I do feel qualified to        16    00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.680    address        17    00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.399    sustainability and the color        18    00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.000    green last fall aided by a stroke of        19    00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.519    marketing genius the university launched        20    00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.239    an ious campaign to Green up the        21    00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.600    school's image and encourage sustainable        22    00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.159    practices in the Harvard Community an        23    00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.560    abundance of Flyers was circulated        24    00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.840    t-shirts and mugs were mented and on a        25    00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.920    crisp October afternoon Al gorim gave        26    00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.640    his Blessing to the cause surrounded by        27    00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.680    banners declaring        28    00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.960    green is the new        29    00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.600    Crimson soon however a different reality        30    00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.320    emerged Ed as stocks entered a period of        31    00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.280    Free Fall Harvard accountants realized        32    00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.079    that while green may have become the new        33    00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.960    Crimson on their balance sheets at least        34    00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.439    red had become the New        35    00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.040    Black in the Gloom of last winter the        36    00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.759    general optimism surrounding        37    00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.600    sustainability seemed challenged and a        38    00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.079    series of questions emerged Ed including        39    00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.240    the difficult realization that some of        40    00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.640    the things we are trying to sustain May        41    00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.119    in fact in the end be        42    00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.280    unsustainable the word sustainability        43    00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.480    itself implies preserving the status quo        44    00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.879    but if the events of the last year have        45    00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.519    taught us anything it is that despite        46    00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.480    our best efforts the world will always        47    00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.360    change around        48    00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.959    us even those parts of the world that        49    00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.080    seem Timeless are in fact subject to        50    00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.160    constant change 50 years ago the space        51    00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.840    in which we are gathered today Harvard        52    00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.720    Yard appeared quite different being        53    00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.560    planted almost exclusively with one        54    00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.800    species of tree the American elm if        55    00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.879    Plato could have conceived of an ideal        56    00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.959    tree the American elm would have been it        57    00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.640    its seeming Perfection as a specimen led        58    00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.400    to its planting and by extension over        59    00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.879    planting not only throughout Harvard's        60    00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.480    campus but on almost every Main Street        61    00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.159    in America America but the days of the        62    00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.920    Elms dominance were numbered starting in        63    00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.560    the 1950s The Elms in Cambridge began to        64    00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.400    die first slowly then in massive numbers        65    00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.120    Dutch elm disease had infected the trees        66    00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.879    and the fact that the Elms were a        67    00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.680    monoculture all susceptible to the same        68    00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.599    pathogen only encouraged the spread of        69    00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.760    the Fatal        70    00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.519    plague having deemed The Elms Trees Too        71    00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.400    iconic to fail        72    00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.319    Harvard launched an Innovative and        73    00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.000    costly campaign to preserve the Elms but        74    00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.680    the deaths continued leafy Harvard Yard        75    00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.560    risk becoming totally denuded unless        76    00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.120    administrators and alumni allowed        77    00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.400    themselves to conceive of the yard        78    00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.920    planted in some other way clearly the        79    00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.040    MMS could not be        80    00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.400    sustained with the advice of professors        81    00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.680    from our Graduate School of Design the        82    00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.959    yard you see planted to today is a small        83    00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.079    reminder not of sustainability but of        84    00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.560    resilience resilience in this context is        85    00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.480    a usage I borrow from Christina Hill a        86    00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.920    prominent alumni of the design school        87    00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.000    who suggests that to confront the        88    00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.600    Monumental challenges of the coming        89    00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.160    Century whether they be design problems        90    00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.359    environmental problems economic problems        91    00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.880    public health problems we need to        92    00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.320    conceive of and design not necessarily        93    00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.880    sustainable systems and solutions but        94    00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.759    resilient ones        95    00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.919    resilience implies a measure of        96    00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.440    adaptability and an ability to spring        97    00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.840    back but it also implies something more        98    00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.520    it implies the ability to spring back to        99    00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.320    a better condition a more beautiful        100    00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.639    condition sometimes the only wrong        101    00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.039    answer to a problem is to keep doing        102    00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.360    what we've been doing in the case of the        103    00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.960    yard to plant more Elms in response to        104    00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.199    the elm crisis we are surrounded today        105    00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.280    not by a monoculture but by Majestic Red        106    00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.120    Oaks delicate honey Locus and graceful        107    00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.600    coffee trees two months ago these Maples        108    00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.720    planted near Memorial Church bore        109    00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.520    Spring's first blooms Crimson ones of        110    00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.759    course and today the cascading white        111    00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.080    flowers of the Yellowwood tree graced        112    00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.120    the air above the heads of this year's        113    00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.280    graduating class and among this chorus        114    00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.080    of trees there yet still remain a few        115    00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.400    ancient Elms whose chances of survival        116    00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.639    are greatly increased when surrounded by        117    00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:35.280    diversity of        118    00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.120    neighbors admittedly at times I would        119    00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.960    like to have seen the structured order        120    00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.520    of the elegant Elms in the yard but I        121    00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.199    know that it is in Nature's genetic        122    00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.800    diversity that nature finds its ability        123    00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.319    to change and evolve in response to        124    00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:52.680    conflict and        125    00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.000    catastrophe and ultimately from this        126    00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.639    diversity that nature Finds Its        127    00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.160    strength as we move past the collective        128    00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.919    celebration of this occasion down our        129    00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:06.880    own individual paths I hope that we can        130    00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.599    each tap into the resilient Spirit of        131    00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:13.400    this yards Forest allowing ourselves to        132    00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.840    grow and evolve not becoming fixated on        133    00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.319    one ideal of perfection that cannot be        134    00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:23.000    sustained but rather imagining ways to        135    00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.599    harness the inevitable transformations        136    00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:30.199    of life to create something greater        137    00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:33.720    it is my belief that if we do this we        138    00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.479    will each flower in our own time and in        139    00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:41.400    our own way and when we do it'll be an        140    00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.199    incredible sight

00:02:58.220    condition be amazingly human Harvard        42    00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.210    let our many capillaries become one        43    00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.940    gloriously nervous system together we        44    00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.970    will resist the weights and sloth of        45    00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:16.460    greed and prejudice we will just say no        46    00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.880    to the drugs of haughtiness and        47    00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.720    self-promotion we will make eye contact        48    00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.830    with strangers who after all are just        49    00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.720    friends we haven't met yet and we will        50    00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.450    smile we will drink from the chalice of        51    00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.730    service and we will randomly act out in        52    00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.680    fits of kindness we will feel each        53    00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.790    other's pain and we will heal ourselves        54    00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.030    before the disease of apathy overwhelms        55    00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.989    our body politic we will study the Arts        56    00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.709    and Sciences of self-control for therein        57    00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:20.750    lies our self-interest our princely past        58    00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.090    will tenderly kiss our fair damsel        59    00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:33.930    future and we will melt in mindfulness        60    00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.390    of the present        61    00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.450    and when our reverence marries our        62    00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.620    daring our greatness will be born of our        63    00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:58.020    goodness be nervous sustainability is        64    00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.210    easy to understand when you put your        65    00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.510    hand on your chest that rhythm is a        66    00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.020    steady march or a hummingbird's frenzy        67    00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:17.830    or slow steps down the stairs when that        68    00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.050    rhythm stops our growth turns to decay        69    00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.580    but that's okay the system just works        70    00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:33.280    that way therefore let our vision be        71    00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.210    larger than our lifetimes what shall we        72    00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.540    do given the inevitable deadline with        73    00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.550    this bundle of nerves and all this        74    00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.910    youthful energy who will lead us to        75    00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:51.870    worldwide synergy the secret of        76    00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.940    sustainability is in the power of        77    00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.820    encouragement have the courage to        78    00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.050    encourage others at the core of the word        79    00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.130    encourage are the letters C oh you are        80    00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:18.160    this comes from the Latin for heart let        81    00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.190    us be each other's humbly steadily        82    00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:28.190    beating hearts stop        83    00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.460    and consider for a moment how we all got        84    00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.950    here this morning how many buses trains        85    00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.990    planes and boats did we arrive on so        86    00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.010    that we could sit on this lawn together        87    00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.380    for a time much briefer than the        88    00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.220    combined hours of travel we spent money        89    00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.980    and release tons of greenhouse gas        90    00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.820    emissions in the process for the        91    00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.160    students we forsake our homes and moved        92    00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.070    here lives laughed cried and ate here        93    00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.950    for the four most critical years of our        94    00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.680    lives to date so that we could sit on        95    00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:17.840    this lawn today together pondering this        96    00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.290    is not about exciting anxiety nor is it        97    00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.470    about exaggerating the weight of this        98    00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.800    particular point in our lives surely the        99    00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.250    days we save a life tell the naked truth        100    00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:42.400    get married become parents grand parents        101    00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.120    will be more momentous so let us take        102    00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.610    something from this day that the passage        103    00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.080    of years cannot erode let us sustain        104    00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.140    these nervous feelings let us take heart        105    00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.820    let us take responsibility for the        106    00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:07.210    spiritual currency that are our words        107    00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.980    let us place our attention on the        108    00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.550    positive and ignore fruitless worry let        109    00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.030    us feed the heedless with a story so        110    00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.690    Grievous

know the MBA teaches us that one of        49    00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.040    the most important        50    00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.800    things is that we are to ask the right        51    00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.080    questions and so on this day back two        52    00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.480    years ago we asked our first        53    00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.599    one I'm paying $150,000 for        54    00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.120    this but uncertain of the path that lay        55    00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.840    ahead anxious for the tasks that would        56    00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.280    follow and eager for the relationships        57    00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.599    that would fall form we pressed        58    00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.000    forward over the last few weeks we've        59    00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.680    had many reminders that our time here is        60    00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.920    drawing to a        61    00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.720    close friends and family starting to        62    00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.080    arrive for        63    00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.120    graduation the endless emails announcing        64    00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.200    the last ever parties that would be here        65    00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.239    hosted by our dear friends at the Latino        66    00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.040    Americano club and the European Club        67    00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.920    reminding us that this is the last time        68    00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.680    ever that we would get to        69    00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.200    tango or perhaps even the jarring        70    00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.599    realization that the time has finally        71    00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.799    come for us to expand our winter        72    00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.480    wardrobes from those black section faces        73    00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.879    that we've worn for over 2        74    00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.040    years but as much as today seems like we        75    00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.799    are        76    00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.760    ending it is very much A New Beginning        77    00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.439    as        78    00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:55.239    well the path ahead still seems very        79    00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.280    uncertain to fix things in a world where        80    00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.319    so much seems so wrong the tasks appear        81    00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.560    immense but building on the        82    00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.680    relationships that we have formed and        83    00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.640    taking joy and courage in these we are        84    00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.920    eager still for what lies ahead to build        85    00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.560    on the memories of this amazing and now        86    00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.759    seemingly fleeting        87    00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:24.160    experience over 500 cases later over a        88    00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.800    thousand hours of preparation time okay        89    00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.039    maybe over 400 hours of PR operation        90    00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:32.600    parents don't worry we just got more        91    00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.440    efficient as the years went by and        92    00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.039    personal balance sheets that may soon        93    00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.560    need a bailout of their        94    00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.000    own we came away with five forces four        95    00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.160    PS three lenses two sides to any issue        96    00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.800    and one Unforgettable        97    00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.639    turkey dreading those 8:40 a.m. call        98    00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.000    calls where your brain keeps moving but        99    00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.560    your mouth struggles to keep up        100    00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.639    realizing that immortality awaited in        101    00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.639    the next edition of the section Sky        102    00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.800    Deck These are times that remind us what        103    00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.880    the HBS experience is all        104    00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.120    about my earliest memory of HBS was of        105    00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.080    lunch on moving day what might have seen        106    00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.759    as the most ordinary of gatherings even        107    00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.000    today was anything        108    00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.759    but Bound by the fact that each of us        109    00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.400    had grown up in the Middle East there we        110    00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.639    sat the four of us an Indian an Arab an        111    00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.960    Israeli and a        112    00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.440    Palestinian breaking bread together as        113    00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.680    brothers and talking about hope for the        114    00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.000    future a couple of those students would        115    00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.759    go on to form the inaugural conference        116    00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:49.960    about business of Peace in the Middle        117    00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.440    East or more recently looking into the        118    00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.319    eyes of Little Children Learning in a        119    00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:59.000    tiny forgotten Village a little bit        120    00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.240    outside of New Delhi India where HBS        121    00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.919    students who had gone on the India track        122    00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.599    had realized that no child no matter how        123    00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:11.960    poor deserved a life without        124    00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.479    education these HBS students took it        125    00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:17.120    upon themselves to raise money and build        126    00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.000    a school that today serves over 200        127    00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.280    children in that school and in the        128    00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.919    surrounding        129    00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:27.720    areas These are times that remind us        130    00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.919    what the HBS experience is all        131    00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:33.520    about constant reminders that the world        132    00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.639    that ushered us to this place 638 days        133    00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:39.080    ago is markedly        134    00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.240    different we are reminded that the        135    00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.000    present economic circumstances have        136    00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.160    impacted everyone take my        137    00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.520    case extensive work        138    00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.000    experience now a Harvard        139    00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.720    MBA and a job offer in hand from a        140    00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.360    well-known consulting        141    00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.360    firm some might consider that I would be        142    00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.759    a pretty reasonable catch in the Indian        143    00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:03.479    arranged marriage        144    00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.039    circles though not a        145    00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.840    doctor as my mother often reminds        146    00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.680    me a recent Wall Street Journal article        147    00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.319    informed me that in these present        148    00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:22.680    circumstances prospective In-laws in        149    00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.039    India consider the term Consulting as        150    00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:28.319    just another word for        151    00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:31.039    unemployed you can't win corporate stock        152    00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:32.960    isn't the only thing being        153    00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.960    devalued but seriously though look        154    00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.199    around us a number of the 900 career        155    00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:42.160    Visions we came to with this place still        156    00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.520    remain        157    00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.800    unfulfilled constant reminders that in        158    00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.560    the matter of a few months a decade's        159    00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.800    worth of wealth creation was wiped away        160    00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.639    a world that is yearning for role models        161    00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:57.080    and looking to us for        162    00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.680    Solutions These are times that remind us        163    00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.159    what the HBS experience is all        164    00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:05.919    about only a few short weeks ago we read        165    00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:07.639    the last of our cases here at Harvard        166    00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:09.720    Business School I know we're going to        167    00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.440    miss all of those case protagonists        168    00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.720    staring through Windows running through        169    00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.520    the airports to catch a flight and yet        170    00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.879    always interestingly having something to        171    00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:19.960    drink in        172    00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.479    hand but importantly our most        173    00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:25.720    significant case study hasn't even been        174    00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.759    written yet it is one in which each of        175    00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:31.360    us will be the case        176    00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.640    protagonist we don't know what that will        177    00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.399    look like but it is one in which the        178    00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:39.519    stakes in that case discussion are much        179    00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:42.000    higher you know there are times when in        180    00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.399    the safety of our classrooms we've        181    00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:46.800    developed elegant solutions to complex        182    00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.600    issues and we've debated them        183    00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.279    vigorously but somehow there was always        184    00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:55.240    this reassuring sense that in 80 minutes        185    00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.360    the discussion would be over and we        186    00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.880    could move on with our lives        187    00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.240    the events of the last few months have        188    00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.040    given me a new perspective of the        189    00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.839    education that we take from this        190    00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:09.360    place on a recent trip to Upstate New        191    00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.920    York I couldn't help but overhear a        192    00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.920    conversation among a middle-aged        193    00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.640    couple they had worked hard all their        194    00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.360    lives saved all that they could had very        195    00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.880    little debt and yet were so afraid of        196    00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.000    losing everything because of        197    00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.560    circumstances in the economy that they        198    00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.640    couldn't control        199    00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.760    the only invisible hand that these        200    00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.360    people knew left them with the feeling        201    00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.320    of being slapped in the        202    00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.800    face these folks would care little what        203    00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.040    a Harvard MBA means the consequences        204    00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.839    they were facing were        205    00:09:44.839 --> 00:09:49.440    real and they wouldn't be solved in 80        206    00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.959    minutes recent events show us that our        207    00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:56.399    community has failed people like this        208    00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:58.880    couple because in certain instances our        209    00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.680    Comm Community has failed to see the        210    00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.519    whole        211    00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:06.640    picture we leave and enter a world that        212    00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.079    is skeptical of the lessons of what we        213    00:10:09.079 --> 00:10:10.600    learn in a place like        214    00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.279    HBS that we are all about talk and        215    00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:14.200    little        216    00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.640    action but if there's one thing that we        217    00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.519    have learned in the hundreds of        218    00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:21.760    cases it's that we cannot solve problems        219    00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.880    merely by looking at them through our        220    00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.040    own eyes we solve problems by looking at        221    00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.279    them Through The Eyes of others        222    00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:33.000    may we hold True to this lesson as we        223    00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.680    March toward our new beginning the time        224    00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.760    for talking is now drawing to a close we        225    00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.320    are being called into        226    00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.600    action we may not have all of the        227    00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.079    answers as soon as we leave this place        228    00:10:45.079 --> 00:10:47.639    and we can't pretend to have all of the        229    00:10:47.639 --> 00:10:50.560    answers but that cannot diminish our        230    00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.600    resolve to work to find the        231    00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.200    solution as we set out to confront these        232    00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.040    real and daunting        233    00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.880    challenges I would offer three pillars        234    00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.600    upon which I would hope our class would        235    00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.920    build its        236    00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.440    foundation three elements adapted from a        237    00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.880    writing inscribed centuries ago yet        238    00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.800    remains Timeless in its        239    00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.560    application three elements that we have        240    00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.360    experienced in our time        241    00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.000    together firstly        242    00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.720    Faith a faith in the lessons we have        243    00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.240    learned and in the tools that we have        244    00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.120    picked up along the way a faith that we        245    00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.200    have seen lived out time and time again        246    00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.120    in the power of one person or a group of        247    00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.360    individuals to make a        248    00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.800    difference whether it is restoring sight        249    00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.240    one operation at a time or creating        250    00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.639    opportunity $1 at a time cases we have        251    00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:49.279    read like The Arend Eye Hospital or        252    00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:50.720    microf Finance        253    00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.480    International remind us of the capacity        254    00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.399    of individuals to change the world that        255    00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:59.839    is around them in spite of repeating        256    00:11:59.839 --> 00:12:02.760    failure these individuals stepped out in        257    00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.120    a faith that sometimes goes contrary to        258    00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.279    the        259    00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.800    rigorous maybe perhaps not knowing        260    00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.000    exactly how things are going to get done        261    00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.720    but believing firmly in what needs to        262    00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.959    get get        263    00:12:29.959 --> 00:12:34.800    done secondly hope audacious as it may        264    00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.680    be but a hope in our abilities to work        265    00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.360    together and to find Creative Solutions        266    00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.440    to problems as we've looked around our        267    00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.800    classrooms and even the faces that are        268    00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.600    represented here today we are reminded        269    00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.399    more and more each day of our shared        270    00:12:53.399 --> 00:12:55.880    Humanity it is what has taken our        271    00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.040    classmates from the blue Ridges of the        272    00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.560    Carolinas to the slums of Kara it is        273    00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.160    what has taken our classmates from the        274    00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.199    heartland of the country to the        275    00:13:05.199 --> 00:13:06.639    Heartbreak of New        276    00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:09.800    Orleans time and time again I am        277    00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.519    reminded that because of the work of        278    00:13:12.519 --> 00:13:14.600    those people that I met at lunch on that        279    00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.760    first        280    00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.079    day there may yet be chance for peace in        281    00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:21.399    the Middle East in our        282    00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:25.199    time all driven by the hope that we can        283    00:13:25.199 --> 00:13:29.000    work together as one and the amazing        284    00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.199    things we can accomplish when we        285    00:13:32.199 --> 00:13:35.279    do and lastly        286    00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:37.959    love what may at first seem out of place        287    00:13:37.959 --> 00:13:40.600    in the setting is a facet I would urge        288    00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.399    each of us to        289    00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:44.760    consider the Beatles may have sung about        290    00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.639    it and said that it's all we need and        291    00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:49.880    it's true and the world desperately        292    00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.079    needs more of        293    00:13:52.079 --> 00:13:56.680    it love is patient love is kind begins        294    00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.519    one of the most striking definitions of        295    00:13:58.519 --> 00:13:59.360    love        296    00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.000    written centuries        297    00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.480    ago it does not envy it does not boast        298    00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.279    it is not        299    00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:09.800    proud that this would be the kind of        300    00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.040    love that we would dare to        301    00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.639    show imperfect as we may be we have each        302    00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:18.880    been shown this love at some time in our        303    00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.079    past even when we've deserved it        304    00:14:22.079 --> 00:14:24.480    least look at those who have supported        305    00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.959    us on this journey here many of whom are        306    00:14:27.959 --> 00:14:29.519    sitting around        307    00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:33.160    us we've rejoiced together as we've        308    00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.000    welcomed little ones into our families        309    00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.920    we've shared tears as we've Bid Farewell        310    00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.120    to Dear ones may we never forget the        311    00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.040    impact that it has had on us and of our        312    00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.920    responsibility to pay it forward may we        313    00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.959    never get so consumed with taking care        314    00:14:49.959 --> 00:14:52.759    of business that we forget to take care        315    00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:54.920    of those most important to        316    00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:59.079    us love does not Delight an evil but        317    00:14:59.079 --> 00:15:02.480    rejoices with the truth it always        318    00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.440    protects always trusts always hopes        319    00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.680    always        320    00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.959    perseveres where we realize that it is        321    00:15:10.959 --> 00:15:13.079    not the discovery of self that leads to        322    00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:15.519    the greatest fulfillment but the giving        323    00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:17.839    of self that        324    00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:21.519    matters for it is with this love that we        325    00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:23.880    begin to see the world a little        326    00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.000    differently it is with this kind of love        327    00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.160    that we start to see the world through        328    00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.720    others eyes may we give more of        329    00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.560    ourselves to our communities to our        330    00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.800    workplaces to our families to bring us        331    00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.079    to a place where love never        332    00:15:41.079 --> 00:15:43.880    fails let it go forth from this place        333    00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.480    and this time that we are a class who is        334    00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.440    ready to serve to restore honor and        335    00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.800    Trust once again in the professions we        336    00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.160    enter that we refuse to accept the        337    00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.240    status        338    00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.560    quo you know when we graduate into the        339    00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.480    to this        340    00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.360    world we enter a time of Crisis without        341    00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.720    precedent for our        342    00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.279    generation and a world that is uncertain        343    00:16:06.279 --> 00:16:09.000    of the role of management professionals        344    00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.440    and of the responsibility of business to        345    00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.959    society that is why as of this morning        346    00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:18.079    nearly 400 of our classmates and I have        347    00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:20.519    voluntarily stepped up to take a pledge        348    00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:23.160    in a student Le initiative that started        349    00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.199    only a few days ago to redefine our        350    00:16:26.199 --> 00:16:28.800    responsibility as Business Leaders

00:16:48.839 --> 00:16:52.399    ourselves accountable to one        359    00:16:52.399 --> 00:16:55.160    another this is the beginning of what we        360    00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.199    call the MBA        361    00:16:57.199 --> 00:16:59.639    oath I hope hope that you will join me        362    00:16:59.639 --> 00:17:01.079    there this        363    00:17:01.079 --> 00:17:03.279    afternoon this does not mean that the        364    00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:06.319    decisions we take become any easier but        365    00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:08.720    this time of Crisis requires a new way        366    00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.400    of thinking a new brand of leadership        367    00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.120    and we as graduates of the MBA class of        368    00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.760    209 are ready to take a        369    00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.919    stand in a similar season of        370    00:17:22.919 --> 00:17:25.360    uncertainty as a fledgling experiment of        371    00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.480    a democratic State lay in danger of        372    00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.480    being extinguished        373

experiment her words still        388    00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.080    ReSound some may regard this time in        389    00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.600    which we graduate as just plain bad        390    00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.480    luck where it's impossible to do        391    00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.000    anything meaningful even with a Harvard        392    00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.960    MBA        393    00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.480    but let us never forget that our        394    00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.240    greatest capacity for change isn't only        395    00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.120    this        396    00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.760    degree it's the hunger that's inside        397    00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.440    each and every one of us to make a        398    00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.080    difference in recent times of prosperity        399    00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.559    and plenty this hunger may have        400    00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:50.200    diminished but these are times that        401    00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.200    remind us that we need that hunger more        402    00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.200    than ever to fulfill the potential of        403    00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.320    our fellow        404    00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.080    citizens        405    00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.400    maybe of those little children outside        406    00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.120    that Village outside of New Delhi or        407    00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.360    maybe that couple in Upstate New

00:19:15.039    world These are times that require all        411    00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:18.559    of the Innovation all of the creativity        412    00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:20.600    all of the Boundless Energy that we have        413    00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.240    seen in each other over these last two        414    00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.640    years These are times that remind us        415    00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.320    what the HBS experience is all        416    00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.679    about nearly 10 years ago I lost someone        417    00:19:36.679 --> 00:19:40.919    I called my best friend my mentor my        418    00:19:40.919 --> 00:19:44.120    role model my        419    00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.679    dad I would give anything for him to be        420    00:19:46.679 --> 00:19:48.559    here        421    00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:50.919    today in a difficult and trying        422    00:19:50.919 --> 00:19:53.559    experience I came to see a lesson that        423    00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:55.720    lives with me even to this        424    00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.640    day on a plane to my father's funeral I        425    00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.159    wondered what tomorrow would        426    00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:03.960    bring it's a question I have seen in the        427    00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.960    eyes of people all over the world over        428    00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.520    these past 2        429    00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.640    years in the        430    00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.159    privilege we have been accorded to come        431    00:20:13.159 --> 00:20:16.720    to learn in a place like this we leave        432    00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.720    with the        433    00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.720    responsibility of working to assure that        434    00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.360    answer and Mom I know that if Dad were        435    00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.720    here        436    00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.760    today he would they look up and        437    00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.360    everything's going to be all        438    00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.200    right and so we go forward to this new        439    00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.799    beginning the second New Century that        440    00:20:38.799 --> 00:20:41.039    marks our time at        441    00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:44.360    HBS I still wonder what tomorrow will        442    00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.200    bring but in the dreams we have shared I        443    00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.799    leave with full        444    00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:51.039    Assurance we may have come here as        445    00:20:51.039 --> 00:20:54.200    citizens of many nations with many        446    00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.840    backgrounds but we leave renewed and        447    00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.640    inextricably linked        448    00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.120    as citizens of the        449    00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.120    world driven by a faith in the lessons        450    00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.640    we have learned and in a cause much        451    00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.720    greater than any of us lifted by a hope        452    00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.080    in our abilities to work with one        453    00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.600    another steadied by a love that cannot        454    00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.039    and will not fail we as a class will        455    00:21:19.039 --> 00:21:22.440    stand to make the difference in this our        456    00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.640    defining        457    00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.320    moment These are times that expect and        458    00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.640    deserve nothing less from each and every        459    00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.120    one of us and this is a call that I know        460    00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.679    we will answer thank you may God bless        461    00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:42.360    you and congratulations class of        462    00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.200    2009        "

need to do wise        44    00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.880    things with it and to give intelligently        45    00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.540    and now I give you MS JK Rowling        46

you        51    00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.490    not only has half had given me an        52    00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.310    extraordinary honor but the weeks of        53    00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.860    fear and nausea I have endured at the        54    00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.690    thought of giving this commencement        55    00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.550    address have made me lose weight        56    00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.000    a win-win situation now all I have to do        57    00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.519    is take deep breaths squint at the red        58    00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.909    banners and convince myself than up that        59    00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:12.980    I am at the world's largest Gryffindor        60    00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.489    reunion        61    00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.900    delivering a commencement address is a        62    00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.080    great responsibility or so I thought        63    00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.320    until I cast my mind back to my own        64    00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.560    graduation the commencement speaker that        65    00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.450    day was the distinguished British        66    00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.590    philosopher Baroness Mary Warnock        67    00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.570    reflecting on her speech has helped me        68    00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.270    enormous Lee in writing this one because        69    00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.860    it turns out that I can't remember a        70    00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:57.490    single word she said this liberating        71    00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.320    discovery enables me to proceed without        72    00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.680    any fear that I might inadvertently        73    00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.040    influence you to abandon promising        74    00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.410    careers in business the law or politics        75    00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.200    for the giddy delights of becoming a gay        76    00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.470    wizard        77    00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:28.830    you see if all you remember in years to        78    00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.169    come is the gay wizard joke I've come        79    00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.999    out ahead of Baroness marijuana        80    00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:40.679    achievable goals the first step to        81    00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:46.649    self-improvement actually I have wrapped        82    00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:48.599    my mind and heart for what I ought to        83    00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.449    say to you today I have asked myself        84    00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:53.579    what I wish I had known at my own        85    00:05:53.579 --> 00:05:56.999    graduation and what important lessons I        86    00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:59.550    have learnt in the 21 years that have        87    00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.239    expired between that day and this I have        88    00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:06.209    come up with two answers on this        89    00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:07.800    wonderful day when we are gathered        90    00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.959    together to celebrate your academic        91    00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:12.779    success I have decided to talk to you        92    00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:16.739    about the benefits of failure and as you        93    00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:18.569    stand on the threshold of what is        94    00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:21.509    sometimes called real life I want to        95    00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:23.519    extol the crucial importance of        96    00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:27.299    imagination these may seem quixotic or        97    00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:31.099    paradoxical choices but bear with me        98    00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.989    looking back at the 21 year old that I        99    00:06:33.989 --> 00:06:36.149    was at graduation is a slightly        100    00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:38.669    uncomfortable experience for the 42 year        101    00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.059    old that she has become half my lifetime        102    00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:45.029    ago I was striking an uneasy balance        103    00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:47.069    between the ambition I had for myself        104    00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:49.739    and what those closest are to me        105    00:06:49.739 --> 00:06:53.399    expected of me I was convinced that the        106    00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:56.369    only thing I wanted to do ever was write        107    00:06:56.369 --> 00:07:00.029    novels however my parents both of whom        108    00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:01.889    came from impoverished backgrounds and        109    00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:04.499    neither of whom had been to college took        110    00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:06.689    the view that my overactive imagination        111    00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:09.509    was an amusing personal quirk that would        112    00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:11.849    never pay a mortgage or secure a pension        113    00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:15.089    I know the irony strikes with the force        114    00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:20.219    of a cartoon anvil now but so they hoped        115    00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:22.279    that I would take a vocational degree I        116    00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:25.009    wanted to study English literature a        117    00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:27.300    compromise was reached that in        118    00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.539    retrospect satisfied nobody and I went        119    00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:33.539    up to study Modern Languages hardly had        120    00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:35.429    my parents car round at the corner at        121    00:07:35.429 --> 00:07:36.860    the end of the road then        122    00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.290    ditched German and scuttled off down the        123    00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.490    classics corridor        124    00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.940    I cannot remember telling my parents        125    00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.370    that I was studying classics they might        126    00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.900    well have found out for the first time        127    00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.310    on graduation day of all the subjects on        128    00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.380    this planet I think they would have been        129    00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.290    hard put to name one less useful than        130    00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.570    Greek mythology when it came to securing        131    00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:04.250    the keys to an executive bathroom now I        132    00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.960    would like to make it clear in        133    00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.360    parentheses that I do not blame my        134    00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.610    parents but their point of view there is        135    00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.280    an expiry date on blaming your parents        136    00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.540    for steering you in the wrong direction        137    00:08:24.749 --> 00:08:27.549    the moment you are old enough to take        138    00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:30.269    the wheel responsibility lies with you        139    00:08:30.269 --> 00:08:33.909    what is more I cannot criticize my        140    00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:35.649    parents for hoping that I would never        141    00:08:35.649 --> 00:08:38.649    experience poverty they had been poor        142    00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:41.259    themselves and I have since been poor        143    00:08:41.259 --> 00:08:44.379    and I quite agree with them that it is        144    00:08:44.379 --> 00:08:47.800    not an ennobling experience poverty        145    00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.430    entails fear and stress and sometimes        146    00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.310    depression it means a thousand petty        147    00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.670    humiliations and hardships climbing out        148    00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.040    of poverty by your own efforts that is        149    00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.139    something on which to pride yourself but        150    00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:05.410    poverty itself is romanticized only by        151    00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:09.639    fools what I feared most for myself at        152    00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:13.720    your age was not poverty but failure at        153    00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.110    your age in spite of a distinct lack of        154    00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.540    motivation at University where I had        155    00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.399    spent far too long in the coffee bar        156    00:09:21.399 --> 00:09:23.829    writing stories and far too little time        157    00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:26.589    at lectures I had a knack for passing        158    00:09:26.589 --> 00:09:30.550    examinations and that for years had been        159    00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.649    the measure of success in my life and        160    00:09:32.649 --> 00:09:36.939    that of my peers now I am not done        161    00:09:36.939 --> 00:09:38.589    enough to suppose that because you are        162    00:09:38.589 --> 00:09:41.860    young gifted and well-educated you have        163    00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.250    never known heartbreak hardship or        164    00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.910    heartache talent and intelligence never        165    00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.250    yet inoculated anyone against the        166    00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.920    Caprice of the fates and I do not for a        167    00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.079    moment suppose that everyone here has        168    00:09:56.079 --> 00:09:58.269    enjoyed an existence of unruffled        169    00:09:58.269 --> 00:10:02.860    privilege and contentment however the        170    00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.389    fact that you are graduating from        171    00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:07.149    Harvard suggests that you are not very        172    00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:10.400    well acquainted with failure        173    00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.170    you might be driven by a fear of failure        174    00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.220    quite as much as a desire for success        175    00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.800    indeed your conception of failure might        176    00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.750    not be too far removed from the average        177    00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.110    person's idea of success so high        178    00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:30.690    have you already flown ultimately we all        179    00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.520    have to decide for ourselves what        180    00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.340    constitutes failure but the world is        181    00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.990    quite eager to give you a set of        182    00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.440    criteria if you let it so I think it        183    00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.080    fair to say that by any conventional        184    00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.840    measure a mere seven years after my        185    00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.500    graduation day I had failed on an epic        186    00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.680    scale an exceptionally short lived        187    00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.830    marriage had imploded and I was jobless        188    00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.100    a lone parent and as poor as it is        189    00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.440    possible to be in modern Britain without        190    00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.980    being homeless the fears that my parents        191    00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.350    had had for me and that I had had for        192    00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.040    myself had both come to pass and by        193    00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.710    every usual standard I was the biggest        194    00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:17.340    failure I knew now I'm not going to        195    00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.990    stand here and tell you that failure is        196    00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.290    fun that period of my life was a dark        197    00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.930    one and I had no idea that there was        198    00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.180    going to be what the press has since        199    00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.760    represented as a kind of fairytale        200    00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.810    resolution I had no idea then how far        201    00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.090    the tunnel extended and for a long time        202    00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.160    any light at the end of it was a hope        203    00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.350    rather than a reality so why do I talk        204    00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:46.680    about the benefits of failure simply        205    00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.930    because failure meant a stripping away        206    00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:52.530    of the inessential I stopped pretending        207    00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.140    to myself that I was anything other than        208    00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.900    what I was and began to direct all my        209    00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.630    energy into finishing the only work that        210    00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.900    mattered to me had I really succeeded at        211    00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.490    anything else I might never have found        212    00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.010    the determination to succeed in the one        213    00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.290    arena where I believed I truly belonged        214    00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:14.790    I was set free because my greatest fear        215    00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.220    had been realized and I was still alive        216    00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.830    and I still had a daughter whom I adored        217    00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.920    and I had an old typewriter and a big        218    00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.730    idea        219    00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.970    and so rock-bottom became the solid        220    00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.259    foundation on which I rebuilt my life        221    00:12:30.259 --> 00:12:33.480    you might never fail on the scale I did        222    00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.899    but some failure in life is inevitable        223    00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:40.980    it is impossible to live without failing        224    00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.169    at something unless you live so        225    00:12:43.169 --> 00:12:45.540    cautiously that you might as well not        226    00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.720    have lived at all in which case you fail        227    00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.679    by default failure gave me an inner        228    00:12:52.679 --> 00:12:54.449    security that I had never attained by        229    00:12:54.449 --> 00:12:57.449    passing examinations failure taught me        230    00:12:57.449 --> 00:12:58.889    things about myself that I could have        231    00:12:58.889 --> 00:13:01.829    learned no other way I discovered that I        232    00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:04.379    had a strong will and more discipline        233    00:13:04.379 --> 00:13:07.410    than I had suspected I also found out        234    00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:10.559    that I had friends whose value was truly        235    00:13:10.559 --> 00:13:13.980    above the price of rubies the knowledge        236    00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.869    that you have emerged wiser and stronger        237    00:13:15.869 --> 00:13:18.119    from setbacks means that you are ever        238    00:13:18.119 --> 00:13:21.649    after secure in your ability to survive        239    00:13:21.649 --> 00:13:24.629    you will never truly know yourself or        240    00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:27.239    the strength of your relationships until        241    00:13:27.239 --> 00:13:30.480    both have been tested by adversity such        242    00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.079    knowledge is a true gift for all that it        243    00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:36.779    is painfully one and it has been worth        244    00:13:36.779 --> 00:13:39.029    more than any qualification I ever        245    00:13:39.029 --> 00:13:43.169    earned so given a time Turner I would        246    00:13:43.169 --> 00:13:45.449    tell my 21 year old self that personal        247    00:13:45.449 --> 00:13:47.369    happiness lies in knowing that life is        248    00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:50.069    not a checklist of acquisition or        249    00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:52.799    achievement your qualifications        250    00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:55.859    your CV are not your life though you        251    00:13:55.859 --> 00:13:57.869    will meet many people of my age and        252    00:13:57.869 --> 00:14:00.989    older who confuse the two life is        253    00:14:00.989 --> 00:14:03.749    difficult and complicated and beyond        254    00:14:03.749 --> 00:14:06.779    anyone's total control and the humility        255    00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:09.359    to know that will enable you to survive        256    00:14:09.359 --> 00:14:13.739    its vicissitudes now you might think        257    00:14:13.739 --> 00:14:15.480    that I chose my second theme the        258    00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.220    importance of imagination because of the        259    00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.709    part it played in rebuilding my life but        260    00:14:19.709 --> 00:14:22.259    that is not wholly so though I        261    00:14:22.259 --> 00:14:24.749    personally will defend the value of        262    00:14:24.749 --> 00:14:27.989    bedtime stories to my last gasp I have        263    00:14:27.989 --> 00:14:30.089    learned to value imagination in a much        264    00:14:30.089 --> 00:14:34.079    broader sense imagination is not only        265    00:14:34.079 --> 00:14:35.500    the uniquely human        266    00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.810    capacity to envision that which is not        267    00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:41.050    and therefore the fount of all invention        268    00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.710    and innovation in its arguably most        269    00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:47.350    transformative and revelatory capacity        270    00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.750    it is the power that enables us to        271    00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.720    empathize with humans whose experiences        272    00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.290    we have never shared one of the greatest        273    00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:57.940    formative experiences of my life        274    00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.670    preceded Harry Potter though it informed        275    00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.500    much of what I subsequently wrote in        276    00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.710    those books this revelation came in the        277    00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:07.860    form of one of my earliest day jobs        278    00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.060    though I was sloping off to write        279    00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.790    stories during my lunch hours I paid the        280    00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:15.880    rent in my early twenties by working at        281    00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.740    the African research department of        282    00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.050    Amnesty International's headquarters in        283    00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.770    London there in my little office        284    00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:26.080    I read hastily scribbled letters        285    00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.770    smuggled out of totalitarian regimes by        286    00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.120    men and women who were risking        287    00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.400    imprisonment to inform the outside world        288    00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.890    of what was happening to them I saw        289    00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.960    photographs of those who had disappeared        290    00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.690    without trace sent to amnesty by their        291    00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.510    desperate families and friends I read        292    00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.240    the testimony of torture victims and saw        293    00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.830    pictures of their injuries        294    00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:51.730    I opened handwritten eyewitness accounts        295    00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.510    of summary trials and executions of        296    00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:58.930    kidnappings and rapes many of my        297    00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.089    co-workers were ex political prisoners        298    00:16:01.089 --> 00:16:03.339    people who had been displaced from their        299    00:16:03.339 --> 00:16:06.370    homes or fled into exile because they        300    00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.500    had the temerity to speak against their        301    00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.410    governments visitors to our offices        302    00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:13.540    included those who who had come to give        303    00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.820    information or to try and find out what        304    00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.170    had happened to those who had they had        305    00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:21.160    left behind I shall never forget the        306    00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.490    African torture victim a young man no        307    00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.980    older than I was at the time who had        308    00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.110    become mentally ill after all he had        309    00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:32.620    endured in his homeland he trembled        310    00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.990    uncontrollably as he spoke into a video        311    00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.390    camera about the brutality inflicted        312    00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:41.110    upon him he was a foot taller than I was        313    00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:45.190    and seemed as fragile as a child I was        314    00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:46.870    given the job of hints courting him back        315    00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.620    to the underground station after        316    00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.230    and this man whose life had been        317    00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:54.350    shattered by cruelty took my hand with        318    00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.320    exquisite courtesy and wished me future        319    00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.580    happiness and as long as I live I shall        320    00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.740    remember walking along an empty corridor        321    00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.440    and suddenly hearing from behind a        322    00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.380    closed door a scream of pain and horror        323    00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.530    such as I have never heard since the        324    00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:15.320    door opened and the researcher poked out        325    00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.320    her out her head and told me to run and        326    00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.240    make a hot drink for the young man        327    00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.900    sitting with her she had just had to        328    00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.120    give him the news that in retaliation        329    00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.610    for his outspokenness against his        330    00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.910    country's regime his mother had been        331    00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:37.070    seized and executed every day of my        332    00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.590    working week in my early twenties I was        333    00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.350    reminded how incredibly fortunate I was        334    00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.270    to live in a country with a        335    00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.730    democratically elected government where        336    00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.130    legal representation and a public trial        337    00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:53.150    were the rights of everyone everyday I        338    00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.960    saw more evidence about the evils        339    00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.100    humankind will inflict on their fellow        340    00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:02.990    humans to gain or maintain power I began        341    00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.150    to have nightmares literal nightmares        342    00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:08.540    about some of the things I saw heard and        343    00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:14.510    read and yet I also learned more about        344    00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.540    human goodness at Amnesty International        345    00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.650    than I had ever known before        346    00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.480    amnesty mobilizes thousands of people        347    00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.950    who have never been tortured or        348    00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.320    imprisoned for their beliefs to act on        349    00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.770    behalf of those who have the power of        350    00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.260    human empathy leading to collective        351    00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:37.120    action saves lives and frees prisoners        352    00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.890    ordinary people whose personal        353    00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.890    well-being and security are assured join        354    00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.800    together in huge numbers to save people        355    00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.950    they do not know and will never meet my        356    00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.800    small participation in that process was        357    00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.560    one of the most humbling and inspiring        358    00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.980    experiences of my life        359    00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:00.010    unlike any other creature on this planet        360    00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:02.770    human beings can learn and understand        361    00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.770    without having experienced they can        362    00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.900    think themselves into other people's        363    00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:12.010    places of course this is a power like my        364    00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.380    brand of fictional magic that is morally        365    00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.470    neutral one might use such an ability to        366    00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.980    manipulate or control just as much as to        367    00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.299    understand or sympathise and many prefer        368    00:19:25.299 --> 00:19:27.400    not to exercise their imaginations at        369    00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.309    all they choose to remain comfortably        370    00:19:30.309 --> 00:19:31.540    within the bounds of their own        371    00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.150    experience never troubling to wonder how        372    00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:35.710    it would feel to have been born other        373    00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.710    than they are they can refuse to hear        374    00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:41.919    screams or peer inside cages they can        375    00:19:41.919 --> 00:19:44.200    close their minds and hearts to any        376    00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.640    suffering that does not touch them        377    00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:50.340    personally they can refuse to know I        378    00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.080    might be tempted to Envy people who can        379    00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.570    live that way except that I do not think        380    00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.230    they have any fewer nightmares than I do        381    00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.360    choosing to live in narrow spaces leads        382    00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.270    to a form of mental Agra phobia and that        383    00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.270    brings its own terrors I think the        384    00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.730    willfully unimaginative see more        385    00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:13.559    monsters they are often more afraid        386    00:20:13.559 --> 00:20:17.049    what is more those who choose not to        387    00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:20.230    empathize enable real monsters for        388    00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:21.700    without ever committing an act of        389    00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.070    outright evil ourselves we collude with        390    00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:28.750    it through our own apathy one of the        391    00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.460    many things I learned at the end of that        392    00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.500    classics corridor down which I ventured        393    00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.750    at the age of 18 in search of something        394    00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:37.600    I could not then define was this written        395    00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.750    by the Greek author Plutarch what we        396    00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.390    achieve inwardly will change outer        397    00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:47.590    reality that is an astonishing statement        398    00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:49.809    and yet proven a thousand times every        399    00:20:49.809 --> 00:20:50.740    day of our lives        400    00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:54.070    it expresses in part our inescapable        401    00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.320    connection with the outside world the        402    00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.120    fact that we touch other people's lives        403    00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.200    simply by existing but how much more are        404    00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.520    you Harvard graduates of 2008 lightly to        405    00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.490    touch other people's lives your        406    00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:10.830    intelligence        407    00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.960    your capacity for hard work the        408    00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.260    education you have earned and received        409    00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:19.170    give you unique unique status and

your borders that        417    00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:44.070    is your privilege and your burden if you        418    00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.500    choose to use your status and influence        419    00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.060    to raise your voice on behalf of those        420    00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.430    who have no voice if you choose to        421    00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:53.430    identify not only with the powerful but        422    00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:56.130    with the powerless if you retain the        423    00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.170    ability to imagine yourself into the        424    00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.760    lives of those who do not have your        425    00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.280    advantages then it will not only be your        426    00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.200    proud families who celebrate your        427    00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.200    existence but thousands and millions of        428    00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.540    people whose reality you have helped        429    00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:13.170    change we do not need magic to transform        430    00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.720    our world we carry all the power we need        431    00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.420    inside ourselves already we have the        432    00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.620    power to imagine better I am nearly        433    00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.590    finished I have one last hope for you        434    00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:28.020    which is something that I already had at        435    00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.230    twenty one the friends with whom i sat        436    00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:33.330    on graduation day have been my friends        437    00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.580    for life they are my children's        438    00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.010    godparents the people to whom I've been        439    00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.400    able to turn in times of real trouble        440    00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.690    people who have been kind enough not to        441    00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.550    sue me when I took their names for Death        442    00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.940    Eaters        443    00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.830    at our graduation we were bound by        444    00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.200    enormous affection by our shared        445    00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.970    experience of a time that could never        446    00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:01.510    come again        447    00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.570    and of course by the knowledge that we        448    00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.000    held certain photographic evidence that        449    00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.660    would be exceptionally valuable if any        450    00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.740    of us ran for prime minister        451    00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:18.759    so today I wish you nothing better and        452    00:23:18.759 --> 00:23:22.960    similar friendships and tomorrow I hope        453    00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.240    that even if you remember not a single        454    00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.169    word of mine        455    00:23:26.169 --> 00:23:29.320    you remember those of Seneca another of        456    00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.110    those old Romans I met when I fled down        457    00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:34.450    the classics corridor in retreat from        458    00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:37.779    from career ladders in search of ancient        459    00:23:37.779 --> 00:23:43.389    wisdom as is a tale so is life not how        460    00:23:43.389 --> 00:23:46.659    long it is but how good it is is what        461    00:23:46.659 --> 00:23:49.749    matters I wish you all very good lives        462    00:23:49.749 --> 00:23:53.249    thank you very much        463    00:24:06.909 --> 00:24:08.970    you

   mention while at this supposedly        50    00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.920    prestigious University chairman banki        51    00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.560    was the class of        52

the length of        60    00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.400    those titles he was a pretty big        61    00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.720    deal in 2002 he joined the Board of        62    00:02:54.720

chairman        65    00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.519    assuming the prominent position        66    00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.599    previously held by Alan Greenspan since        67    00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.599    February 1st 2006 when it comes to        68    00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.360    monetary policy all eyes have been on        69    00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.319    chairman        70    00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.080    Bernan given his accomplishments as a        71    00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.400    scholar a policy maker and above all as        72    00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.239    a teacher it is truly an honor to have        73    00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.000    President chairman Bernan address us        74    00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.200    today please join Luther and me in        75    00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.560    welcome welcoming him back to Harvard as        76    00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.760    he gives us one final        77    00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.159    lesson hello        78    00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.319    Harvard it seems to me        79    00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.599    paradoxically that both long ago and        80    00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.079    Only Yesterday I attended my own class        81    00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.280    day in        82    00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.760    1975 I'm pleased and honored to be        83    00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.640    invited back by the students of Harvard        84    00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.120    our speaker in 1975 was Dick Gregory the        85    00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.040    social critic and comedian who was        86    00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.599    inclined toward the sharp edged and the        87    00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.400    satiric central Bankers don't do satire        88    00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.400    as a rule so I'm going to just try for a        89    00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.760    kind of        90    00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.600    interesting when I attended class day as        91    00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.960    a graduating        92    00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.680    senior Gerald Ford was president and an        93    00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.800    upand coming fellow named Alan Greenspan        94    00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.160    was his chief economic        95    00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.639    adviser just weeks earlier the last        96    00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.320    Americans remaining in Saigon had been        97    00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.400    evacuated by        98    00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.280    helicopters on a happier note the Red        99    00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.520    Sox were on their way to winning the        100    00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.039    American League        101    00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.639    pennant I skipped classes to attend a        102    00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.000    game of the World Series against the        103    00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.720    Cincinnati        104    00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.280    Reds as was their want in those days the        105    00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.479    socks came agonizingly close before        106    00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.160    snatching defeat from the draws of        107    00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.160    victory        108    00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.039    on that score as on others disco music        109    00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:06.880    and Pet Rocks come to        110    00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.440    mind many things are better today than        111    00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.840    they were        112    00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.160    then in fact that will be a theme of my        113    00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.120    remarks although 1975 was a pretty good        114    00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.280    year for the Red Sox it wasn't such a        115    00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.319    good year for the US        116    00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:25.680    economy then as now we were experiencing        117    00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.280    a serious oil price shock sharply Rising        118    00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.680    prices for food and other Commodities        119    00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.840    and subpar economic        120    00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.199    growth but I see differences between the        121    00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.360    economy of 1975 in the economy of 2008        122    00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.080    that are more telling than the        123    00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.520    similarities today's situation differs        124    00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.960    from that of 33 years ago in large part        125    00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.520    because our economy and Society have        126    00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.319    become much more flexible and able to        127    00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:57.199    adapt to difficult situations and new        128    00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.000    challenges        129    00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.039    economic policymaking has improved as        130    00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.360    well I believe partly because we have        131    00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.400    learned some of the hard lessons of the        132    00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.080    past of course I don't want to minimize        133    00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.800    the difficult challenges we currently        134    00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.880    face and I will come back to some of        135    00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.000    these but I do think that our        136    00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.440    demonstrated ability to respond        137    00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.319    constructively and effectively to past        138    00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:25.199    economic problems provides a basis for        139    00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:27.880    optimism about the        140    00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.759    future I will focus my remarks today on        141    00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:32.639    two economic issues that challenged Us        142    00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.720    in the 1970s and that still do so today        143    00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.199    energy and        144    00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.840    productivity these obviously are not the        145    00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.000    kinds of topics chosen by many recent        146    00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.160    class day        147    00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.479    speakers will frell Ali G or Seth        148    00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:50.120    mcfarling to name a        149    00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.599    few but uh then the class Marshals        150    00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:53.800    presumably knew what they were getting        151    00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.599    when they invited an        152    00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:58.919    economist because the members of today's        153    00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.280    graduating class and some of your        154    00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.360    professors were not yet born in        155    00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.280    1975 let me Begin by briefly surveying        156    00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.080    the economic landscape of the mid        157    00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.680    1970s the economy had just gone through        158    00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.639    a severe recession during which output        159    00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:18.840    income and employment had fallen sharply        160    00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.840    and the unemployment rate had risen to        161    00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.440    9% meanwhile Consumer Price inflation        162    00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.479    which had been around 3% to 4% earlier        163    00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:31.680    in the decade soared to 10% during my        164    00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.560    senior        165    00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.919    year the oil price shock of the 1970s        166    00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:39.400    began in October        167    00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.160    1973 when in response to the Yom Kipper        168    00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.479    War Arab oil producers imposed an        169    00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:48.199    embargo on oil        170    00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:51.639    exports before the Embargo in 1972 the        171    00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:55.199    in price of imported oil was about $3.20        172    00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:56.000    a        173    00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.840    barrel by 1975 the average price was 144        174    00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.960    a barrel more than four times        175    00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.400    greater President Nixon had imposed        176    00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.479    economy-wide controls on wages and        177    00:08:07.479 --> 00:08:09.039    prices in        178    00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:12.199    1971 including prices of petroleum        179    00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:15.400    products in November 1973 in the wake of

00:08:25.599    prices as B basic economics predicts        183    00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:27.280    when a scarce resource cannot be        184    00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.120    determined by market

 00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:45.040    1974 in an attempt to overcome the        191    00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.120    unintended consequences of price        192    00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.600    controls drivers in many places were        193    00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.399    permitted to buy gasoline only on odd or        194    00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:54.880    even days of the month

   slowed and production was curtailed        200    00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.800    which of course only made things        201    00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.399    worse in addition to creating long lines        202    00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:18.480    of gasoline stations the oil price shock        203    00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.360    exacerbated what was already an        204    00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.880    intensifying buildup of inflation and        205    00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.440    inflation        206    00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.560    expectations in another echo of today        207    00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.720    the inflationary situation was was        208    00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.279    worsened by rapidly Rising prices of        209    00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:36.279    agricultural products and other        210    00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.920    Commodities economists generally agreed        211    00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.000    that monetary policy performed poorly        212    00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.160    during this        213    00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.519    period in part this was because policy        214    00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:47.880    makers in choosing what they beli to be        215    00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.839    the appropriate setting for monetary        216    00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:52.360    policy overestimated the productive        217    00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.279    capacity of the        218    00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:57.640    economy I'll have more to say about this        219    00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.279    shortly Federal Reserve policy makers        220    00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:02.320    also underestimated both their own        221    00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.279    contributions to the inflationary        222    00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:06.760    problems of the time and their ability        223    00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.480    to curb that        224    00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.680    inflation for example on occasion they        225    00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.079    blamed inflation on so-called cost push        226    00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:17.320    factors such as Union wage pressures and        227    00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.279    price increases by large Market        228    00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:20.920    dominating        229    00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.360    firms however the abilities of some        230    00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.399    firms and unions to push through        231    00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:27.600    inflationary wage and price increases        232    00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.839    were symptoms of the problem not the        233    00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:31.399    underlying        234    00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:33.959    cause several years passed before the        235    00:10:33.959 --> 00:10:36.279    Federal Reserve gained a new leadership        236    00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:37.720    that better understood the central        237    00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.440    bank's role in the inflation process and        238    00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.880    that that understood that sustained        239    00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.279    anti-inflationary monetary policies        240    00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:46.800    would actually        241    00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.040    work beginning in 1979 such policies        242    00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.399    were implemented successfully although        243    00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:54.399    not without significant costs in terms        244    00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:57.040    of lost output and employment under fed        245    00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.839    chairman Paul vulker        246    00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:02.320    for the Federal Reserve Two crucial        247    00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.279    lessons from this experience were first        248    00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:07.079    that high inflation can seriously        249    00:11:07.079 --> 00:11:11.000    destabilize an economy and second that        250    00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.200    the Central Bank must take        251    00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.040    responsibility for achieving price        252    00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.480    stability over the medium        253    00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.160    term fast forward now to        254    00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.880    2003 in that year crude oil cost a        255    00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.320    little more than $30 per        256    00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.600    barrel since then crude oil pric have        257    00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.920    increased more than        258    00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.040    fourfold proportionately about the same        259    00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.880    as in the        260    00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.760    1970s now as in        261    00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.360    1975 adjusting to such high prices for        262    00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.160    crude has been        263    00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.360    painful gas prices around $4 per gallon        264    00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.560    are a huge burden for many households as        265    00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.440    well as for truckers manufacturers        266    00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.320    farmers and        267    00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.320    others but in many other ways The        268    00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.560    Economic Consequences have been quite        269    00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.120    different from those in the        270    00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.600    1970s one obvious difference is what you        271    00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.959    don't see drivers lining up on odd or        272    00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:09.279    even days to buy gasoline because of        273    00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:12.440    price controls or signs at gas stations        274    00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.800    that say no        275    00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.399    gas and until the recent slowdown which        276    00:12:17.399 --> 00:12:19.000    is more the result of conditions in        277    00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.959    housing and financial markets than of        278    00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:23.920    higher oil prices economic growth was        279    00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.480    solid and unemployment remained low        280    00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.639    unlike we saw after the oil price        281    00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:31.279    increases the        282    00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:34.320    1970s for a central Banker a        283    00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.040    particularly critical difference between        284    00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.320    then and now is what has happened to        285    00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.199    inflation and inflation        286    00:12:41.199 --> 00:12:43.560    expectations the overall inflation rate        287    00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.000    has averaged about 3 and a half% over        288    00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.680    the past four quarters significantly        289    00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.240    higher than we would like but much less        290    00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.600    than the double- digigit rates that        291    00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.600    inflation reached in the mid 1970s and        292    00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.440    then again in        293    00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.079    1980 moreover the increase in inflation        294    00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:02.519    has been milder this time on the order        295    00:13:02.519 --> 00:13:05.279    of 1 percentage point over the past year        296    00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:06.800    as compared with the six percentage        297    00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.800    Point jump that followed the 1973 oil        298    00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.839    price        299    00:13:10.839 --> 00:13:13.760    shock from the perspective of monetary        300    00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.920    policy just as important as the behavior        301    00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.800    of actual inflation is what households        302    00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.680    and businesses expect to happen to        303    00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.160    inflation in the future particularly        304    00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.800    over the longer        305    00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.480    term if people expect an increase in        306    00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.920    inflation to be temporary and do not        307    00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.959    build it into their long-term plans for        308    00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:35.560    setting wages and prices then the        309    00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.440    inflation created by a shock to oil        310    00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.360    prices will tend to fade relatively        311    00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.120    quickly some indicators of longer term        312    00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.440    inflation expectations have risen in        313    00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.680    recent months which is a significant        314    00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.759    concern for the Federal Reserve we will        315    00:13:51.759 --> 00:13:54.639    need to monitor that situation        316    00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:57.639    closely however changes in longer term        317    00:13:57.639 --> 00:13:59.160    inflation expectations have been        318    00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.519    measured in tenths of a percentage point        319    00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:03.759    this time around rather than in whole        320    00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:05.880    percentage points as appeared to be the        321    00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.759    case in the mid        322    00:14:07.759 --> 00:14:10.639    197s importantly we see little        323    00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:13.000    indication today of the beginnings of a        324    00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.680    1970 style wage price spiral in which        325    00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.639    wages and prices chased each other ever        326    00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:23.120    upward a good deal of economic research        327    00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.519    has looked at the question of why the        328    00:14:24.519 --> 00:14:27.000    inflation response to the oil shock has        329    00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.639    been relatively muted in the current        330    00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:30.759    instance        331    00:14:30.759 --> 00:14:33.440    one factor which illustrates my point        332    00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.720    about the adaptability and flexibility        333    00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.480    of the US economy is the pronounced        334    00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.720    decline in the energy intensity of our        335    00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.680    economy since about        336    00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.480    1975 since then the energy required to        337    00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.320    produce a given amount of output in the        338    00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.839    US economy has fallen by about        339    00:14:51.839 --> 00:14:54.680    half this great Improvement in Energy        340    00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.839    Efficiency was less the result of        341    00:14:56.839 --> 00:14:59.480    government programs than of steps taken        342    00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.040    by households and businesses in response        343    00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.759    to higher energy prices including        344    00:15:04.759 --> 00:15:06.519    substantial investments in more energy        345    00:15:06.519 --> 00:15:10.160    efficient equipment and means of        346    00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.120    transportation this Improvement in        347    00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.320    Energy Efficiency is one of the reasons        348    00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.959    why a given increase in crude oil prices        349    00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:19.839    does less damage to the US economy today        350    00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:22.519    than it did in the        351    00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.920    1970s another reason is the performance        352    00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.680    of monetary policy the Federal Reserve        353    00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.680    and other central banks have learned the        354    00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.880    lessons of the        355    00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.720    1970s because monetary policy works with        356    00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.399    a lag the short-term inflationary        357    00:15:37.399 --> 00:15:39.120    effects of a Sharp increase in oil        358    00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.920    prices can generally not be fully        359    00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.639    offset however since Paul vul's time the        360    00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:48.240    Federal Reserve has been firmly        361    00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.639    committed to maintaining a low and        362    00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:53.600    stable rate of inflation over the longer        363    00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.440    term and we recognize that keeping        364    00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.480    longer term inflation expectations well        365    00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.560    anchored        366    00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.759    is essential to achieving this goal of        367    00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:03.680    low and stable        368    00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.120    inflation maintaining the confidence in        369    00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.639    the fed's commitment to price stability        370    00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:11.120    remains a top priority as the Central        371    00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.560    Bank navigates the current complex        372    00:16:15.639 --> 00:16:18.079    situation Although our economy has thus        373    00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:19.639    far dealt with the current oil price        374    00:16:19.639 --> 00:16:22.319    shock comparatively well the United        375    00:16:22.319 --> 00:16:23.959    States and the rest of the world still        376    00:16:23.959 --> 00:16:26.560    face significant challenges in coping        377    00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.360    with the rising Global demand for energy        378    00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.199    especially if continued demand growth        379    00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:33.720    and constrained supplies maintain the        380    00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.319    intense pressure on        381    00:16:36.319 --> 00:16:38.759    prices the silver lining of higher        382    00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:41.279    energy prices is that they provide a        383    00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:44.160    powerful incentive for action for        384    00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.440    conservation including investment in        385    00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.000    energy-saving Technologies for the        386    00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.759    investment needed to bring new oil        387    00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:53.120    supplies to Market and for the        388    00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.120    development of new conventional and        389    00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.319    non-conventional energy        390    00:16:57.319 --> 00:16:59.839    sources the government in addition to        391    00:16:59.839 --> 00:17:01.839    the market can usefully address energy        392    00:17:01.839 --> 00:17:04.799    concerns for example by supporting basic        393    00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:07.199    research and adopting well-designed        394    00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:09.559    regulatory policies to promote important        395    00:17:09.559 --> 00:17:13.120    social objectives such as protecting the        396    00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.319    environment as we saw after the oil        397    00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:19.120    price shock of the 1970s given some time        398    00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.199    the economy can become much more energy        399    00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:24.120    efficient even as it continues to grow        400    00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.959    and living standards        401    00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:29.320    improve let me turn now to the other        402    00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.919    economic challenge I want to highlight        403    00:17:30.919 --> 00:17:33.600    today the productivity performance of        404    00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.360    our        405    00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.880    economy at this point you may be saying        406    00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.679    to yourself is it too late to book Ali        407    00:17:41.679 --> 00:17:44.039    G however anyone who stayed awake        408    00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:47.840    through E10 knows why this subject is        409    00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.160    important as Adam Smith pointed out in        410    00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.960    1776 in the long run more than any other        411    00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.320    Factor the productivity of the workforce        412    00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.280    determines the nation's standard of        413    00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.440    living        414    00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.840    the decades following World War II were        415    00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.760    remarkable for their industrial        416    00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:09.000    Innovation and creativity from 1948 to        417    00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.039    1973 output per hour of work grew by        418    00:18:12.039 --> 00:18:14.559    about 3% per year on        419    00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:17.679    average but then for the next 20 years        420    00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:20.320    or so productivity growth averaged only        421    00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.039    about 1 and a half% per year about half        422    00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:24.400    the previous        423    00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.559    rate predictably the rate of increase in        424    00:18:27.559 --> 00:18:29.960    the standard of living slowed as well to        425    00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.799    about the same        426    00:18:31.799 --> 00:18:34.360    extent the difference between 3% and 1        427    00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.799    and 1/2% may not sound like much but at        428    00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:40.400    3% per year the standard of living would        429    00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.600    double about every 23 years or about        430    00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.760    once every generation and by contrast at        431    00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.200    1 and a half% a doubling would occur        432    00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.000    only roughly every 47 years or once        433    00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.360    every other        434    00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.760    generation among the many consequences        435    00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.080    of the productivity slowdown was a        436    00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.880    further complic ation for the monetary        437    00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.679    policy makers of the        438    00:19:02.679 --> 00:19:05.240    1970s detecting shifts in economic        439    00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.679    Trends is difficult in real time and        440    00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:10.159    most economists and policy makers did        441    00:19:10.159 --> 00:19:11.880    not fully appreciate the extent of the        442    00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.360    productivity slowdown until the late        443    00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.200    1970s this further influenced the policy        444    00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.200    makers of the time toward running a        445    00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.760    monetary policy that was too        446    00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.120    accommodative the resulting overheating        447    00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.880    of the economy probably exacerbated the        448    00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.039    inflation problems of that        449    00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:33.640    decade productivity growth revived in        450    00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.919    the mid 1990s as I mentioned        451    00:19:35.919 --> 00:19:38.600    illustrating once again the resilience        452    00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.120    of the American        453    00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.080    economy since        454    00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.919    1995 productivity has increased about a        455    00:19:44.919 --> 00:19:47.520    25% annual        456    00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.240    rate a great deal of intellectual effort        457    00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.679    has been expended in trying to explain        458    00:19:52.679 --> 00:19:54.919    the recent performance and to to        459    00:19:54.919 --> 00:19:56.720    forecast the future performance of        460    00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.919    productivity        461    00:19:58.919 --> 00:20:00.600    much very good work has been condu        462    00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.919    conducted here at Harvard by Dale        463    00:20:02.919 --> 00:20:05.080    Jorgenson who was my senior thesis        464    00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.640    adviser in 1975 by the way and by his        465    00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.799    colleagues and other important research        466    00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:11.960    in this area has been done at the        467    00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.720    Federal Reserve        468    00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.559    board one key finding of the research is        469    00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:19.240    that to have an economic impact        470    00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.000    technological innovations must be        471    00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.400    translated into successful commercial        472    00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.840    applications this country's competitive        473    00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.880    market-based system its flexible capital        474    00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.480    and labor markets its tradition of        475    00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.679    Entrepreneurship and its technological        476    00:20:34.679 --> 00:20:36.919    strengths to which Harvard and other        477    00:20:36.919 --> 00:20:38.480    universities make a critical        478    00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.720    contribution help to ensure that this        479    00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.000    happens on an ongoing        480    00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.520    basis while private sector initiative        481    00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.679    was the key ingredient in generating the        482    00:20:48.679 --> 00:20:51.159    pickup in productivity growth government        483    00:20:51.159 --> 00:20:53.720    policy was constructive in part through        484    00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.600    basic research support but also to a        485    00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.159    substantial degree by promoting economic        486    00:20:58.159 --> 00:21:00.159    competition        487    00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:02.960    beginning in the late 1970s the federal        488    00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.559    government deregulated a number of        489    00:21:04.559 -->

increase in        492    00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.480    competition promoted cost reductions and        493    00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.679    Innovation leading in turn to new        494    00:21:16.679 --> 00:21:18.279    products and new        495    00:21:18.279 --> 00:21:20.600    Industries it's difficult to imagine        496    00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.320    that we would have online retailing        497    00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.679    today if the transportation and        498    00:21:24.679 --> 00:21:26.840    Telecommunications Industries had not        499    00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.000    been deregulated        500    00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.640    in addition the lowering of trade        501    00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.159    barriers increased productivity gains by        502    00:21:33.159 --> 00:21:35.919    increasing prod uh competition expanding        503    00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:37.919    markets and increasing the pace of        504    00:21:37.919 --> 00:21:39.320    Technology        505    00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.720    transfer and finally as a central Banker        506    00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.799    I would be remiss if I failed to mention        507    00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:45.679    the contribution of monetary policy to        508    00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:47.559    the improved productivity        509    00:21:47.559 --> 00:21:49.919    performance by damping business cycles        510    00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:52.559    and by keeping inflation under control a        511    00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:55.039    sound monetary policy improves the        512    00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:57.760    ability of households and firms to plan        513    00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.240    and increases their willingness to        514    00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.720    undertake the investments in skills        515    00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.600    research and physical capital needed to        516    00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.360    support continuing gains in        517    00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.400    productivity just as the productivity        518    00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.200    slowdown was associated with the slower        519    00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.840    growth of real per capita income the        520    00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.320    productivity Resurgence since the mid        521    00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.720    1990s has been accompanied by a pickup        522    00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.279    in real income        523    00:22:21.279 --> 00:22:23.760    growth one measure of average living        524    00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.039    standards real consumption per capita is        525    00:22:27.039 --> 00:22:31.279    nearly 35% higher higher today than in        526    00:22:31.279 --> 00:22:34.480    1995 in addition the flood of innovation        527    00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.159    that helped spur the productivity        528    00:22:36.159 --> 00:22:38.799    Resurgence has created many new jobs        529    00:22:38.799 --> 00:22:41.000    opportunities and quite a few fortunes        530    00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:41.960    as        531    00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.880    well but changing technology has also        532    00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.679    reduced job opportunities for some        533    00:22:46.679 --> 00:22:49.240    others bank tellers and assembly line        534    00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.720    workers for example and that is the Crux        535    00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.039    of a whole new set of        536    00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:57.559    challenges even though average economic        537    00:22:57.559 --> 00:22:59.360    well-being hased increased considerably        538    00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.880    over time the degree of inequality in        539    00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.840    economic outcomes over the past three        540    00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.320    decades has increased as        541    00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.000    well economists continue to Grapple with        542    00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.320    the reasons for this        543    00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.520    trend but the best we can tell the        544    00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.279    increase in inequality is probably due        545    00:23:16.279 --> 00:23:19.159    to a number of factors notably including        546    00:23:19.159 --> 00:23:21.520    technological change that seems to have        547    00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.600    favored higher skilled workers over        548    00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.880    lower skilled        549    00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.880    ones in addition some economists point        550    00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.240    to increase international trade and the        551    00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.840    declining role of labor unions as other        552    00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.080    but possibly lesser contributing        553    00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.400    factors what should we do about Rising        554    00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.360    economic        555    00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.720    inequality answering this question        556    00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.640    inevitably involves difficult value        557    00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.200    judgments and        558    00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.840    tradeoffs but approaches that inhibit        559    00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.080    the dynamism of our economy would        560    00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.559    clearly be a step in the wrong        561    00:23:53.559 --> 00:23:56.840    direction to be sure new technologies        562    00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.559    and increased international trade can        563    00:23:58.559 --> 00:24:01.159    lead to painful dislocations as some        564    00:24:01.159 --> 00:24:03.480    workers lose their jobs or see the        565    00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.840    demand for their skills        566    00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.679    decrease however hindering the adoption        567    00:24:08.679 --> 00:24:10.559    of new technologies or inhibiting trade        568    00:24:10.559 --> 00:24:13.200    flows would do far more harm than good        569    00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.919    over the long Hall in the short term the        570    00:24:16.919 --> 00:24:19.039    better approach is to adopt policies        571    00:24:19.039 --> 00:24:21.200    that help those who are displaced by        572    00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.279    economic        573    00:24:22.279 --> 00:24:24.880    change by doing so we not only provide        574    00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.200    assistance to those who need it but help        575    00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.480    to provide public support for the        576    00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.039    economic flexibility that is so        577    00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:33.399    essential for        578    00:24:33.399 --> 00:24:35.880    prosperity in the long term however the        579    00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.559    best way by far to improve Economic        580    00:24:38.559 --> 00:24:41.640    Opportunity and to reduce inequality is        581    00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.840    to increase the educational attainment        582    00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.279    and skills of American        583    00:24:46.279 --> 00:24:48.720    workers the productivity surge in the        584    00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.320    decades after World War II corresponded        585    00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.880    to a period in which educational        586    00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.559    attainment was increasing rapidly in        587    00:24:55.559 --> 00:24:57.960    recent decades progress on that front        588    00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.360    has been far        589    00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.039    slower moreover inequalities in        590    00:25:02.039 --> 00:25:04.960    education and in access to education        591    00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.159    remain        592    00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:08.480    high as we think about improving        593    00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.279    education and skills we should also look        594    00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:13.279    beyond the traditional k12 and four-year        595    00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:16.399    college system as important as that is        596    00:25:16.399 --> 00:25:18.159    to recognize that education can be        597    00:25:18.159 --> 00:25:20.480    lifelong and take many        598    00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.200    forms early childhood education        599    00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.440    community colleges vocational schools on        600    00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.200    the- job training online courses adult        601    00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.600    education all of these are vehicles of        602    00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.240    demonstrated value in increasing skills        603    00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.520    and earning        604    00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.279    power the use of a wide range of methods        605    00:25:38.279 --> 00:25:40.399    to address the pressing problem of        606    00:25:40.399 --> 00:25:42.720    inadequate skills and economic        607    00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.240    inequality would be entirely consistent        608    00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.520    with the themes of economic adaptability        609    00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.720    and flexibility that I've emphasized in        610    00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.640    my        611    00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.840    remarks I'll close by shifting from the        612    00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.720    topic of Education in general to your        613    00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.080    education specifically class of        614    00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:05.480    2008 through effort talent and doubtless        615    00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.720    some luck you have succeeded in        616    00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.720    acquiring an excellent        617    00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.760    education your education more precisely        618    00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.679    your ability to think critically and        619    00:26:17.679 --> 00:26:20.360    creatively is your greatest        620    00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.600    asset and unlike many assets the more        621    00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.200    you draw on it the faster it grows put        622    00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.240    it to good use        623    00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.840    the poor forecasting record of        624    00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.840    economists is legendary but I'm going to        625    00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.679    make a forecast of which I'm very        626    00:26:36.679 --> 00:26:39.240    confident whatever you expect your life        627    00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.880    and work to be like 10 20 or 30 years        628    00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.880    from now the reality will be quite        629    00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.120    different in looking over the 30th        630    00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.760    Anniversary report of my own class I was        631    00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.799    struck by the great diversity of        632    00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:55.279    vocations and advocations that have        633    00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:56.720    engaged my        634    00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.039    classmates to be sure the volume was        635    00:26:59.039 --> 00:27:00.919    full of attorneys and Physicians and        636    00:27:00.919 --> 00:27:03.039    professors as well as Architects        637    00:27:03.039 --> 00:27:06.720    Engineers editors bankers and even a few        638    00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.200    economists many listed the title vice        639    00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.600    president and not a few listed the title        640    00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.799    president but the class of 1975 also        641    00:27:15.799 --> 00:27:17.240    included those who listed their        642    00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.480    occupations as composer environmental        643    00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:25.440    Advocate musician playright Rabbi        644    00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.720    conflict

00:27:33.799 --> 00:27:36.159    more conventional job descriptions the        648    00:27:36.159 --> 00:27:38.039    nature of our daily work and its        649    00:27:38.039 --> 00:27:39.960    relationship to our economy and to our        650    00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:43.159    society is I am sure very different from        651    00:27:43.159 --> 00:27:45.799    what we might have guessed in        652    00:27:45.799 --> 00:27:48.480    1975 my point is only that you cannot        653    00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.360    predict your path you can only try to be        654

  I'm sure all of us have spent some time        8    00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.760    over the past week reflecting on our        9    00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.960    years here at        10    00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.200    Harvard my own reflection has brought to        11    00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.079    mind a few moments that chronical the        12    00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.320    changes in growth I've experienced Here        13    00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.320    My Story begins in June of 1999 when I        14    00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.920    attended a commencement ceremony here at        15    00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.160    Harvard as my younger brother completed        16    00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.879    his undergraduate        17    00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.160    studies as I spoke with him and his        18    00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.519    classmates became very clear that a        19    00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.039    personal transformation had occurred        20    00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.159    during their time        21    00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.439    here at a quiet moment after the        22    00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.360    ceremony I had a conversation with my        23    00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.520    brother John that changed my whole        24    00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.759    correction in        25    00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.200    life I said I would love to attend        26    00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.960    graduate school at Harvard but the        27    00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.479    programs require full-time study to        28    00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.520    which John responded have you heard of        29    00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.439    the heart extension        30    00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.799    school that's how my journey began my        31    00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.600    first educational experience on campus        32    00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.960    involved going to the library for        33    00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.399    retriev resource materials seemed easy        34    00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.960    enough there I was standing at the        35    00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.720    bottom of the Towering steps of Widener        36    00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.399    Library feeling like an alien Intruder        37    00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.439    in a world where I was unsure if I        38    00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.799    belonged much to my relief out of the        39    00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.600    corner of my eye I saw a small door to        40    00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.960    the left of        41    00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.399    Winer without another thought I dashed        42    00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.439    down the stairs trying above all to look        43    00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.880    natural I was soon lost in the Labyrinth        44    00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.920    of bookshelves and hallways in a panic        45    00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.119    and afraid to ask for assistance I read        46    00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.240    the fire exit map on the wall I followed        47    00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.879    the red painted line on the        48    00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:10.640    floor finally I stepped into a marble        49    00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.599    hallway and saw a guard beautifully        50    00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.680    checking at the as students casually        51    00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.680    entered the building I burst past and        52    00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.800    out the door to find I was standing on        53    00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.519    top of the fair steps of Winer that had        54    00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.160    intimidated Me 2 hours        55    00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.599    earlier at that moment I realized two        56    00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.440    unescapable Facts of Life at aror one        57    00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.239    I'm going to need a GPS to get around        58    00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.879    campus two being intimidated by the        59    00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.480    surroundings was no longer an option it        60    00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.720    was clear that the change from nervous        61    00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.480    student to confident learner had        62    00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.920    begun I continued to progress to the        63    00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.879    program I took classes I met new        64    00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.000    challenges in larger classes there were        65    00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.599    the additional requirements for graduate        66    00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.080    students the most memorable for me was        67    00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.159    Professor Dante sp's triple threat of        68    00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.000    term paper examination and inclass        69    00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.680    presentation        70    00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.760    that presentation was the first time I        71    00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.360    stood in front of a full        72    00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.840    Auditorium the thought of not doing well        73    00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.519    was the cause of several sleepless        74    00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.560    nights the result of Performing well was        75    00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.159    the confidence to stand here        76    00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.200    today the challenges and growth        77    00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.799    continued through statistics and        78    00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.080    intensive writing then there was the pro        79    00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.519    seminar the focus developing academic        80    00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.319    arguments and the patience of my        81    00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.000    instructor Professor white who taught me        82    00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.920    to write in the academic style was my        83    00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.599    final hurdle before applying to the        84    00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.439    program as a concentrator in Psychology        85    00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.680    I noticed I was changing as a student I        86    00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.120    would often consider what would these        87    00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.439    changes mean where would they bring me        88    00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:45.640    one of the most comforting and        89    00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.599    understated descriptions of how change        90    00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.840    occurs came to me in a seminar class        91    00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.959    with Professor Iber Cohen at the time I        92    00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.519    met Professor Cohen he was in his late        93    00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.640    80s still writing still teaching the        94    00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.040    evening before class began professor        95    00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.560    presided over a discussion of how        96    00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.519    current events are changing the world as        97    00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.200    we know it as class was scheduled to        98    00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.720    start he stopped the discussion and said        99    00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.360    the world has only changed significantly        100    00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.360    once in my        101    00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.359    life we all leing close to hear the next        102    00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.880    sentence with        103    00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.759    anticipation Professor Coen continued        104    00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.840    when the fleet of ships carrying coffee        105    00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.680    switched from sale to Modern sleep        106    00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.320    we all        107    00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.840    laugh he waited patiently and then        108    00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.360    continued you see there was an aged        109    00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.120    salty and Oak flavor the coffee had from        110    00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.600    those long slow trips in wooden        111    00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.160    sailboats it is gone now and it will        112    00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.720    never return my world is different than        113    00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.440    it was the flavor has        114    00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.039    changed after all the classes the final        115    00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:56.240    challenge the thesis project the trials        116    00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.759    of this experience are both testing and        117    00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:00.199    rewarding        118    00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.880    my project involved changing social        119    00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.280    attitudes surrounding relational        120    00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.320    bullying in adolescence through the use        121    00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.240    of        122    00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.320    literature the project pushed me to new        123    00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.960    heights of research experience and        124    00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.000    writing        125    00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.400    skill at the same time the project also        126    00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.039    increased my self-confidence in        127    00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:16.680    approaching people persistence by        128    00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.240    forcing me to find a potential thesis        129    00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.520    director and then convincing him of the        130    00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.319    worth of my intended        131    00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:26.039    study for me the process led to a career        132    00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.160    change and a careful examination of my        133    00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.840    occupational options as an educ        134    00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.680    ending in an exciting new opportunity        135    00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.479    with greater responsibility this coming        136    00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.039    fall I came here seeking the personal        137    00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.039    transformation that only learning and        138    00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.280    education can provide I leave having        139    00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.919    found it in this way we have all changed        140    00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.199    our worlds as subtle as those changes        141    00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.479    may be they are profound        142    00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:57.639    nonetheless as we walk past those steps        143    00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.440    of Wier today on our commencement day I        144    00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.039    was reminded of my frantic search for        145    00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:05.919    the exit in my first days at Harvard I        146    00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.360    realized that now my thesis Bound in its        147    00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.919    Crimson cover is a part of that        148    00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:14.360    library's collection along with the        149    00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.240    personal transformation it represents        150    00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.040    congratulations my classmates

before I pay        6    00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.160    tribute today to a truly exceptional        7    00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.919    class people I'd like to pay tribute to        8    00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.320    a truly exceptional individual without        9    00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.470    whom I could only dream of being here my        10    00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.489    wonderful mother        11    00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.120    every answer in the crowd today many        12    00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.219    years ago now many years ago now many        13    00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.230    years ago now my mother left behind her        14    00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.180    life in Istanbul because she believed        15    00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.190    that my star might shine more bright        16    00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.739    abroad when I grew confident as a        17    00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.870    schoolboy in London she never let me        18    00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.300    forget the value of my roots when I grew        19    00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.070    pompous as an undergraduate        20    00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.950    she'd remind me that true knowledge is        21    00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.869    not confined within the walls of a        22    00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.940    library but that only by understanding        23    00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.660    others may one derived true wisdom on my        24    00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.240    behalf I must dedicate today to her and        25    00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.970    to my lovely little sister but in behalf        26    00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.640    of the entire graduating class I should        27    00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.800    like to dedicate today to all of our        28    00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.020    cherished families and friends without        29    00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.869    whose love and constant support we        30    00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.929    simply could not have flourished here        31    00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:36.030    without you none of our stars could have        32    00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.330    shone as bright and so today is in many        33    00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330    ways actually your day and it is we who        34    00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:53.069    should be applauding you and what of our        35    00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.039    time at Harvard Law School for we soon        36    00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.940    to BLM's        37    00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.280    it's been pretty much a ferocious sprint        38    00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.220    all year a year packed with work a year        39    00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.280    packed with play and so much else it's        40    00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.720    been a momentous time to be at Harvard        41    00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.849    at the beginning of our year here the        42    00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.259    Boston Red Sox won the World Series        43    00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.860    Harvard named its first female president        44    00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.210    and a chap Dean Kagan says he went here        45    00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.120    a senator from Illinois launched his        46    00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.520    presidential bid offering America and        47    00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.500    the world an opportunity to hope again        48    00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.830    all the while the law school has        49    00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.420    reflected the nature of its own hopes        50    00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.190    and aspirations by embarking on an        51    00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.650    ambitious construction project and by        52    00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.020    implementing a curriculum overhaul that        53    00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.280    is thought to make our legal education        54    00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.710    here even more relevant to an ever        55    00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.710    globalizing world but what are we        56    00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.410    al-alem's learnt at Harvard Law School        57    00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.500    what is it that will take away with us        58    00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.570    before we came to Harvard we're a        59    00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.970    diverse bunch of individuals a hundred        60    00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.710    and seventeen are drawn from sixty odd        61    00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.440    countries our academic interests ranging        62    00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.850    everything from the incredibly        63    00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.800    interesting world of statutes to the to        64    00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.300    the troubled terrains of comparative        65    00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.430    constitution ism from the human rights        66    00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.010    of individuals to the human rights no        67    00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.980    doubt of corporations when we came to        68    00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.290    Harvard we wrote our reaction papers we        69    00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.090    wrote our short papers wrote our long        70    00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.520    papers we took our place on panels we        71    00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.280    served on law reviews there I say some        72    00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.010    of us myself included even try to dance        73    00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.260    at bar review but that is not all        74    00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.550    because the accomplished individuals        75    00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.250    that came to Harvard a year ago now now        76    00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.400    leave a truly exceptional class of        77    00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.690    people this year for us has seen a        78    00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.960    gradual but profound coming together a        79    00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.310    realization that what sets us apart need        80    00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.620    never divide us we've come together to        81    00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.720    celebrate one another's cultures we've        82    00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.680    come together to debate to Lomax State        83    00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.680    but also to support one another at times        84    00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.370    of difficulty we've come to be great        85    00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.160    ambassadors to and for this venerable        86    00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.090    institution and we will continue to be        87    00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.799    but I think the spirit of our class is        88    00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.600    best captured by the eight words        89    00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.840    emblazoned above and behind me on the        90    00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.110    walls of this magnificent library        91    00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.930    non sub hominid said sat down at leg a        92    00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.240    not under man but under God and the law        93    00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.370    he's not just words of wisdom these are        94    00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.499    words of profound courage they come not        95    00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:47.180    from a Roman philosopher writing at        96    00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.180    leisure but from an English judge a Sir        97    00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.219    Edward Cooke who risked his life by        98    00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:53.930    uttering them to his King James the        99    00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.939    first who believed passionately that        100    00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:58.009    there could be no law that there could        101    00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.550    be no judgment higher than his own but        102    00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.639    Cooke believed with an equal passion but        103    00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.409    if the rule of law was going to be the        104    00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.809    supreme law then subjects must be tried        105    00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:12.069    not by their king but by their courts        106    00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:14.360    Cooke stood up for the principle of        107    00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.759    legality against the authority of his        108    00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.779    king risked his life in doing so and he        109    00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:24.529    succeeded this is the spirit of our        110    00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:27.199    class we all come from different nations        111    00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:28.669    but were all brought together by a        112    00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.259    worldview one based on equality Liberty        113    00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:35.089    tolerance and fairness under the rule of        114    00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:39.939    law but we also know that is not enough        115    00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:42.379    we know that if the worldview that we        116    00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:46.099    hold so dear is to remain credible then        117    00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:47.149    it has to be first and foremost        118    00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:50.389    effective that the best answer to fear        119    00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.539    is always hope but that hope requires        120    00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:56.599    belief and belief comes only from words        121    00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:58.580    that have been turned into deeds and        122    00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.249    that some of those deeds may take        123    00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:04.729    considerable courage of conviction it is

   00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.490    Our next speaker, first known as the entrepreneur of the personal computer revolution, was named by Time magazine as one of the hundred people who most influenced the 20th century.        2    00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:35.654    As well as one of the hundred most influential people of 2004, 2005, 2006 and again in 2007.        3    00:00:35.654 --> 00:00:40.549    Just think what you could have achieved...        4    00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:43.523    [Laughter.]        5    00:00:43.523 --> 00:00:46.894    ...if you had stayed here another 2 years.        6    00:00:46.894 --> 00:00:57.400    [Laughter and then applause.]        7    00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.162    He enrolled at Harvard in the fall of 1973.        8    00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:07.280    Keenly interested in computer science but without a definite study plan.        9    00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.319    [Some laughing.]        10    00:01:10.518 --> 00:01:18.759    In between intense poker games at Radcliffe, he met his future business partner, Steve Balmer.        11    00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:25.271    And he developed a version of the programming language Basic for the first microcomputer.        12    00:01:25.271 --> 00:01:33.869    And co-authored and published a paper on algorithms, with computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.        13    00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.906    Our speaker is a person of many talents.        14    00:01:38.906 --> 00:01:48.500    A close friend in college amusingly recalls seeing him dose of during a prestigious Putnam math exam.        15    00:01:48.502 --> 00:01:53.768    Despite this napping he scored remarkably well.        16    00:01:53.768 --> 00:02:02.360    In his junior year he took a leave of absence from Harvard to devote his energies to Microsoft.        17    00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:08.440    A company he had begun in 1975 with his friend Paul Allen.        18    00:02:08.894 --> 00:02:15.469    Since 2000 he has begun to concentrate on a number of philanthropic endeavors.        19    00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:26.449    Making extraordinary donations to various charitable organisations and scientific research programs around the world, through the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation.        20    00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:32.120    After a 33 year leave of absence from his alma matter.        21    00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:37.030    I am pleased to present to you Doctor William Gates.        22    00:02:37.228 --> 00:03:04.929    [Standing Ovation.]        23    00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:07.118    Thank you.        24    00:03:07.118 --> 00:03:20.507    President Bach, former president Rudenstine, incoming president Faust, members of the Harvard corporation and the board of overseers.        25    00:03:20.507 --> 00:03:25.657    Members of the faculty, parents and especially the graduates.        26    00:03:25.657 --> 00:03:31.687    I've been waiting more than 30 years to say this.        27    00:03:31.687 --> 00:03:37.980    Dad I always told you I'd come back and get my degree.        28    00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:49.116    [Applause and some laughter.]        29    00:03:49.116 --> 00:03:53.159    I wanna thank Harvard for this honour.        30    00:03:53.159 --> 00:04:00.826    I'll be changing my job next year and it will be nice to finally have a college degree on my resume.        31    00:04:00.826 --> 00:04:02.560    [Laughter.]        32    00:04:02.565 --> 00:04:09.020    I applaud the graduates for taking a much more direct route to your degrees.        33    00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:16.910    From our- my part I'm just happy that the Crimson called me Harvard's most successful drop out.        34    00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.600    I guess that makes me valedictorian of my own special class.        35    00:04:22.603 --> 00:04:26.246    I did the best of everyone who failed.        36    00:04:26.246 --> 00:04:29.227    [Laughter.]        37    00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:36.700    But I also want to be recognised as the guy who got Steve Balmer to drop out of business school.        38    00:04:36.702 --> 00:04:43.080    [Laughter and then also applause.]        39    00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.440    I'm a bad influence.        40    00:04:45.443 --> 00:04:50.799    That's why I was invited to speak at your graduation.        41    00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:57.830    If I'd spoken at your orientation fewer of you might be here today.        42    00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.889    [Laughter then also applause.]        43    00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.507    Harvard was a phenomenal experience for me.        44    00:05:06.507 --> 00:05:09.330    Academic life was fascinating.        45    00:05:09.334 --> 00:05:14.607    I used to sit in on lots of classes that I hadn't even signed up for.        46    00:05:14.607 --> 00:05:17.137    And dorm life was terrific.        47    00:05:17.137 --> 00:05:20.610    I lived up at Radcliffe, in Courier House.        48    00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:22.890    [Cheering.]        49    00:05:22.894 --> 00:05:31.875    There were always a lot of people in my dorm room late at night discussing things, because everyone knew that I didn't worry about getting up in the morning.        50    00:05:31.875 --> 00:05:33.828    [Laughter.]        51    00:05:33.828 --> 00:05:37.450    That's how I came to be the leader of the antisocial group.        52    00:05:37.453 --> 00:05:42.680    We clunged each other as a way of validating our rejection of all those social people.        53    00:05:43.217 --> 00:05:46.190    Radcliffe was a great place to live.        54    00:05:46.804 --> 00:05:51.787    There were more women up there and most of the guys were math-science types.        55    00:05:51.787 --> 00:05:56.597    The combination offered me the best odds, if you know what I mean.        56    00:05:56.597 --> 00:05:59.159    [Laughing.]        57    00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:06.418    That's where I learned the sad lesson that improving your odds doesn't guarantee you success.        58    00:06:06.418 --> 00:06:08.920    [Laughing.]        59    00:06:08.922 --> 00:06:15.700    One of my biggest memories of Harvard came in January 1975.        60    00:06:15.704 --> 00:06:24.699    When I made a call from Courier House to a company in Albuquerque, New Mexico, that had begun making the worlds first personal computer.        61    00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.580    I offered to sell them software.        62    00:06:27.584 --> 00:06:33.516    I worried they would realise I was just a student in a dorm and hang up on me.        63    00:06:33.516 --> 00:06:38.638    Instead they said, we're not quite ready, come see us in a month.        64    00:06:38.638 --> 00:06:43.140    Which was a good thing because we hadn't written the software yet.        65    00:06:43.144 --> 00:06:44.495    [Laughing.]        66    00:06:44.495 --> 00:06:56.780    From that moment I worked day and night on the extra credit project that marked the end of my college education and the beginning of a remarkable journey with Microsoft.        67    00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:05.050    What I remember above all about Harvard, was being in the midst of so much energy and intelligence.        68    00:07:05.054 --> 00:07:12.555    It could be exhilarating, intimidating, sometimes even discouraging but always challenging.        69    00:07:12.555 --> 00:07:24.430    It was an amazing privilege and though I left early, I was transformed by my years at Harvard, the friendships I made and the ideas I worked on.        70    00:07:24.433 --> 00:07:31.949    But taking a serious look back, I do have one big regret.        71    00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:48.099    I left Harvard with no real awareness of the awful inequities in the world, the appalling disparities of health and wealth, and opportunity, that condemn millions of people to lives of despair.        72    00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:53.820    I learned a lot here at Harvard about new ideas and economics and politics.        73    00:07:53.822 --> 00:07:58.686    I got great exposure to the advances being made in the sciences.        74    00:07:58.686 --> 00:08:09.160    But humanities greatest advances are not in its discoveries, but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity.        75    00:08:09.163 --> 00:08:19.230    [Applause.]        76    00:08:19.231 --> 00:08:31.800    Whether through democracy, strong public education, quality health care or broad economic opportunity; reducing inequity is the highest human achievement.        77    00:08:31.804 --> 00:08:41.740    I left campus knowing little about the millions of young people cheated out of educational opportunities here in this country.        78    00:08:41.741 --> 00:08:50.230    And I knew nothing about the millions of people living in unspeakable poverty and disease in developing countries.        79    00:08:50.232 --> 00:08:53.595    It took me decades to find out.        80    00:08:53.595 --> 00:08:59.026    You graduates came to Harvard at a different time.        81    00:08:59.026 --> 00:09:04.330    You know more about the worlds inequities than the classes that came before.        82    00:09:04.331 --> 00:09:18.710    In your years here I've hope you've had a chance to think about how in this age of accelerating technology we can finally take on these inequities and we can solve them.        83    00:09:18.714 --> 00:09:28.689    Imagine just for the sake of discussion that you have a few hours a week and a few dollars a month to donate to a cause.        84    00:09:28.689 --> 00:09:36.749    And you wanted to spend that time and money where it would have the greatest impact in saving and improving lives.        85    00:09:36.749 --> 00:09:38.400    Where would you spend it?        86    00:09:38.405 --> 00:09:42.330    For Melinda and I the challenge is the same.        87    00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:47.680    How can we do the most good for the greatest number with the resources we have?        88    00:09:47.684 --> 00:10:03.078    During our discussions on this question, Melinda and I read an article about the millions of children who are dying every year in poor countries from diseases that we have long ago made harmless in this country.        89    00:10:03.078 --> 00:10:09.329    Measles, malaria, pneumonia, hepatitis-b, yellow fever.        90    00:10:09.329 --> 00:10:17.068    One disease that I had never heard of, rotavirus, was killing half a million children each year.        91    00:10:17.068 --> 00:10:19.680    None of them in the United States.        92    00:10:19.684 --> 00:10:21.710    We were shocked.        93    00:10:21.714 --> 00:10:33.368    We had assumed that if millions of children were dying and they could be saved, the world would make it a priority to discover and deliver the medicines to save them.        94    00:10:33.368 --> 00:10:34.950    But it did not.        95    00:10:34.954 --> 00:10:41.858    For under a dollar there were interventions that could save lives that just weren't being delivered.        96    00:10:41.858 --> 00:10:53.106    If you believe that every life has equal value, it's revolting to learn that some lives are seen as worth saving and others are not.        97    00:10:53.106 --> 00:11:02.307    We said to ourselves this can't be true, but if it is true it deserves to be the priority of our giving.        98    00:11:02.307 --> 00:11:09.420    So we begin ou- began our work in the same way anyone here would begin it.        99    00:11:09.423 --> 00:11:14.550    We asked, how could the world let these children die?        100    00:11:14.554 --> 00:11:17.197    The answer is simple and harsh        101    00:11:17.197 --> 00:11:24.969    The market did not reward saving the lives of these children and governments did not subsidise it.        102    00:11:24.969 --> 00:11:33.750    So the children die because their mothers and fathers hadno power in the market and no voice in the system.        103    00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.610    But you and I have both        104    00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:45.890    We can make market for- forces work better for the poor if we can develop a more creative capitalism.        105    00:11:45.891 --> 00:12:00.130    If we can stretch the reach of market forces so that more people can make a profit or at least earn a living, serving people who are suffering from the great inequities.        106    00:12:00.132 --> 00:12:11.829    We can also press governments around the world to spend tax payer money in ways that better reflect the values of the people who pay the taxes.        107    00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:27.079    If we can find approaches that meet the needs of the poor in ways that generate profits for business and votes for politicians, we will have found a sustainable way to reduce inequity in the world.        108    00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:30.500    Now this task is open ended.        109    00:12:30.501 --> 00:12:38.250    It can never be finished, but a conscious effort to answer this challenge can change the world.        110    00:12:38.252 --> 00:12:41.816    I'm optimistic that we can do this.        111    00:12:41.816 --> 00:12:46.369    But I talk to skeptics who claim there is no hope.        112    00:12:46.369 --> 00:12:57.166    They say inequity has been with us since the beginning and will be with us until the end, because people just don't care.        113    00:12:57.166 --> 00:13:00.870    I completely disagree.        114    00:13:00.871 --> 00:13:06.586    I believe we have more caring than we know what to do with.        115    00:13:06.586 --> 00:13:15.786    All of us here in this yard, at one time or another, have seen human tragedies that broke our heart.        116    00:13:15.786 --> 00:13:17.236    And yet we did nothing.        117    00:13:17.236 --> 00:13:22.210    Not because we don't care, but because we didn't know what to do.        118    00:13:22.211 --> 00:13:26.240    If we had known how to help we would have acted.        119    00:13:26.242 --> 00:13:31.360    The barrier to change is not too little caring.        120    00:13:31.363 --> 00:13:33.478    It is too much complexity.        121    00:13:33.478 --> 00:13:41.897    To turn caring into action, we need to see a problem, see a solution and see the impact.        122    00:13:41.897 --> 00:13:46.020    But complexity blocks all three steps.        123    00:13:46.022 --> 00:13:57.190    Even with the advent of the internet and 24 hour news, it is still a complex enterprise to get people to truly see the problems.        124    00:13:57.192 --> 00:14:02.207    When an airplane crashes, officials immediately call a press conference.        125    00:14:02.207 --> 00:14:08.480    They promise to investigate, determine the cause and prevent similar crashes in the futures.        126    00:14:08.481 --> 00:14:23.140    But if the officials were brutally honest, they would say, ""Of all the people in the world who died today from preventable causes, 1 half of 1 percent were on this plane."".        127    00:14:23.144 --> 00:14:31.660    We're determined to do everything possible to solve the problem that took the lives of 1 half of 1 percent.        128    00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:39.220    The problem is not just the plane crash but the millions of preventable deaths.        129    00:14:39.225 --> 00:14:49.520    We don't read much about these deaths, the media covers what's new and millions of people dying is nothing new.        130    00:14:49.522 --> 00:14:53.608    So it stays in the background where it's easy to ignore.        131    00:14:53.608 --> 00:15:01.229    But even when we do see it or read about it, it's difficult to keep our eye- eyes on the problem.        132    00:15:01.229 --> 00:15:10.740    It's difficult to look at suffering if the situation is so complex that we don't know how to help and so we look away.        133    00:15:10.741 --> 00:15:19.180    If we can really see a problem, which is the first step, we come to the second step.        134    00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.800    Cutting through the complexity to find a solution.        135    00:15:23.801 --> 00:15:30.570    Finding solutions is essential if we want to make the most of our caring.        136    00:15:30.573 --> 00:15:40.710    If we have clear and proven answers any time an organisation or an individual asks, ""How can I help?"", then we can get action.        137    00:15:40.714 --> 00:15:45.710    And we can make sure that none of the caring in the world is wasted.        138    00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:55.340    The complexity makes it hard to mark a path of action for everyone who cares and makes it hard for that caring to matter.        139    00:15:55.342 --> 00:16:03.299    Cutting through complexity to find solutions runs through 4 predictable stages:        140    00:16:03.299 --> 00:16:07.609    Determine a goal. Find the highest impact approach.        141    00:16:07.609 --> 00:16:17.040    Deliver the technology ideal for that approach and in the mean time use the best application of technology you already have.        142    00:16:17.045 --> 00:16:23.200    Whether it's something sophisticated like a new drug or something simple like a bed net.        143    00:16:23.205 --> 00:16:32.480    The aids epidemic offers an example, the broad goal of course is to end the disease.        144    00:16:32.484 --> 00:16:43.700    The highest leverage approach is prevention, the ideal technology would be a vaccine that gives life long immunity with a single dose.        145    00:16:43.701 --> 00:16:50.655    So governments, drug companies and foundations are funding vaccine research.        146    00:16:50.655 --> 00:16:54.100    But their work is likely to take more than a decade.        147    00:16:54.116 --> 00:17:03.600    So in the mean time we have to work with what we have in hand and the best prevention approach we have now is getting people to avoid risky behavior.        148    00:17:03.607 --> 00:17:08.400    Pursuing that goal starts the 4 step cycle again.        149    00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:10.400    This is the pattern.        150    00:17:10.432 --> 00:17:15.971    The crucial thing is to never stop thinking and working.        151    00:17:15.971 --> 00:17:22.973    And never do what we did with malaria and tuberculosis in the 20th century.        152    00:17:22.973 --> 00:17:27.298    Which is to surrender to complexity and quit.        153    00:17:27.298 --> 00:17:43.200    The final step after seeing the problem and finding an approach, is to measure the impact of the  work and to share that, success or failure, so that others can learn from the efforts.        154    00:17:43.215 --> 00:17:53.000    You have to have the statistics, of course, you have to be able to  show for example that a program is vaccinating million more- millions more children.        155    00:17:53.024 --> 00:17:59.780    You have to be able to show for example a decline in the number of children dying from the diseases.        156    00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:08.800    This is essential not just to improve the program but also to help draw more investment from business and government        157    00:18:08.824 --> 00:18:16.167    But if you want to inspire people to participate, you have to show more than numbers.        158    00:18:16.167 --> 00:18:21.593    You have to convey the human impact of the work.        159    00:18:21.593 --> 00:18:27.600    So people can feel what saving a life means to the families affected.        160    00:18:27.637 --> 00:18:39.600    I remember going to the World Economic Forum some years back and sitting on a global health panel that was discussing ways to save millions of lives.        161    00:18:39.625 --> 00:18:42.300    Millions.        162    00:18:42.328 --> 00:18:50.000    Think of the thrill if you could save just one persons life, then multiply that by millions.        163    00:18:50.038 --> 00:18:55.196    Yet this was the most boring panel I had ever been on-        164    00:18:55.196 --> 00:18:56.100    [Laughter.]        165    00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:57.100    -ever.        166    00:18:57.143 --> 00:19:02.300    So boring that even I couldn't stand it.        167    00:19:02.306 --> 00:19:16.800    What made that experience especially striking was that I had just come from an event where we were introducing version 13 of some piece of software, and we had people jumping and shouting with excitement.        168    00:19:16.831 --> 00:19:21.400    I love getting people excited about software,        169    00:19:21.419 --> 00:19:27.998    [Non-emergency siren in distant background.] But why can't we generate even more excitement for saving lives.        170    00:19:27.998 --> 00:19:33.800    You can't get people excited unless you can help them see and feel the impact.        171    00:19:33.828 --> 00:19:46.371    [Applause.]        172    00:19:46.371 --> 00:19:50.591    The way to do that is another complex question.        173    00:19:50.591 --> 00:19:53.600    Still, I'm optimistic.        174    00:19:53.615 --> 00:20:03.760    Yes inequity has been with us forever, but the new tools we have to cut through complexity have not been with us forever.        175    00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.352    They are new.        176    00:20:05.352 --> 00:20:08.400    They can help us make the most of our caring.        177    00:20:08.449 --> 00:20:12.700    And that's why the future can be different from the past.        178    00:20:12.728 --> 00:20:23.073    The defining and ongoing innovations of this age, biotechnology, the personal computer and the internet.        179    00:20:23.073 --> 00:20:26.552    Give us a chance we've never had before.        180    00:20:26.552 --> 00:20:32.000    To end extreme poverty and end death from preventable disease.        181    00:20:32.033 --> 00:20:44.100    60 years ago George Marshall came to this commencement and he announced a plan to assist the nations of post war Europe.        182    00:20:44.100 --> 00:21:06.280    He said, I quote ""I think one difficulty, is that the problem is one of such enormous complexity that the very massive facts presented to the public by press and radio, make it exceedingly difficult for the man in the street to reach a clear appraisement        183    00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.962    of the situation.        184    00:21:07.962 --> 00:21:16.800    It is virtually impossible, at this distance, to grasp at all the real significance of the situation."".        185    00:21:16.839 --> 00:21:27.800    30 years after Marshall made his address, which was 30 years ago, as my class graduated without me.        186    00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:37.900    Technology was emerging that would make the world smaller, more open, more visible, less distant.        187    00:21:37.919 --> 00:21:51.253    The emergence of low cost personal computers gave rise to a powerful network that has transformed opportunities for learning and communicating.        188    00:21:51.253 --> 00:22:00.100    The magical thing about this network is not just that it collapses distance and makes everyone your neighbour.        189    00:22:00.109 --> 00:22:08.500    It also dramatically increases the number of brilliant minds we can bring in to work together on the same problem.        190    00:22:08.543 --> 00:22:14.400    And it scales up the rate of potential innovation to a staggering degree.        191    00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:22.696    At the same time for every person who has access to this technology, 5 people don't.        192    00:22:22.696 --> 00:22:27.168    That means many creative minds are left out of this discussion.        193    00:22:27.168 --> 00:22:39.152    Smart people with practical intelligence and relevant experience, who don't have the technology to hone their talents or contribute their ideas to the world.        194    00:22:39.152 --> 00:22:55.400    We need as many people as possible to gain access to this technology, because these advances are triggering a revolution in human- in what human beings can do for one another.        195    00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:06.300    They are making it possible, not just for national governments, but for universities, corporations, small organisations and even individuals        196    00:23:06.337 --> 00:23:20.263    to see problems, see approaches and measure the impact of their efforts to address the hunger, poverty and desperation George Marshall spoke of 60 years ago.        197    00:23:20.263 --> 00:23:31.174    Members of the Harvard family, here in the yard is one of the great collections of intellectual talent in the world.        198    00:23:31.174 --> 00:23:34.082    For what purpose?        199    00:23:34.082 --> 00:23:48.884    There is no question that the faculty, the alumni, the students and the benefactors of Harvard have used their power to improve the lives of people here and around the world.        200    00:23:48.884 --> 00:23:51.294    But can we do more?        201    00:23:51.294 --> 00:23:59.658    Can Harvard dedicate its intellect to improving the lives of people who will never even hear its name.        202    00:23:59.658 --> 00:24:07.359    Let me make a request of the deans and professors, the intellectual leaders here at Harvard.        203    00:24:07.359 --> 00:24:23.600    As you hire new faculty, award tenure, review curriculum and determine degree requirements, please ask yourself, should our best minds be more dedicated to solving our biggest problems?        204    00:24:23.649 --> 00:24:30.000    Should Harvard encourage its faculty to take on the worlds worst inequities?        205    00:24:30.022 --> 00:24:36.700    [Applause.]        206    00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:54.495    Should Harvard students know about the depth of global poverty, the prevalence of world hunger, the scarcity of clean water, the girls kept out of school, the children who die from diseases we can cure?        207    00:24:54.495 --> 00:25:01.063    Should the worlds most privileged learn about the lives of the worlds least privileged?        208    00:25:01.063 --> 00:25:05.800    These are not rhetorical questions.        209    00:25:05.827 --> 00:25:12.000    [Applause.]        210    00:25:12.011 --> 00:25:14.900    You will answer with your policies        211    00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:25.000    My mother who was filled with pride the day I was admitted here, never stopped pressing me to do more for others.        212    00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:33.825    A few days before I was married she hosted a bridal event at which she read aloud a letter about marriage that she had written to Melinda.        213    00:25:33.825 --> 00:25:43.733    My mother was very ill with cancer at the time but she saw one more opportunity to deliver her message and at the close of the letter she said,        214    00:25:43.733 --> 00:25:49.600    ""From those to whom much is given, much is expected."".        215    00:25:50.424 --> 00:26:00.990    [Applause.]        216    00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:15.100    When you consider what those of us here in this yard have been given in talent, privilege and opportunity, there is almost no limit to what the world has a right to expect from us.        217    00:26:15.141 --> 00:26:28.687    In line with the promise of this age, I want to exhort each of the graduates here to take on an issue, a complex problem, a deep inequity and become a specialist on it.        218    00:26:28.687 --> 00:26:32.600    If you make it the focus of your career that would be phenomenal.        219    00:26:32.636 --> 00:26:36.800    But you don't have to do that to make an impact.        220    00:26:36.808 --> 00:26:50.400    For a few hours every week you can use the growing power of the internet to get informed, find others with the same interests, see the barriers and find ways to cut through them.        221    00:26:50.422

however then I thought you know then I        101    00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.160    was reading all I could find out about        102    00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.600    the class and I thought well they don't        103    00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.880    want to have any fun today they already        104    00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.240    had fun they had this classwide risk        105    00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.720    tournament around exam        106    00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.080    time and I understood when I heard the        107    00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.880    followership speech I understood why you        108    00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.199    had that now you can all run for        109    00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.039    president you played        110    00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.320    Risk it's an 8-year risk        111    00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.880    tournament I thought well maybe it's        112    00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.639    because you're mouth to        113    00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.600    name Drew F your next president and I        114    00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.039    think women should run everything        115    00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.720    now and and        116    00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.520    then then I figured maybe it was just        117    00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.320    because Robin Williams and Billy Crystal        118    00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.479    turned you        119    00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.039    down but for whatever        120    00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:20.520    reason we're here and I have had a        121    00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.080    really good        122    00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.520    time you've already heard most of what        123    00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.639    you need to hear today I think        124    00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.919    but I I want to focus for a minute on        125    00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.000    the fact        126    00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.600    that these graduating classes since        127    00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.479    1968 have invited a few non-c        128    00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.039    comedians the first was Martin Luther        129    00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:52.360    King who was killed in April        130    00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.960    before I remember that very very well        131    00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.240    because it was my senior year at        132    00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.360    Georgetown he was killed in        133    00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.240    April before he could come and give the        134    00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.720    speech and uh ketta came and gave a        135    00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.720    speech for him        136    00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.240    here and you've had Mother Teresa and        137    00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.599    you've had        138    00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.199    Bono what do they all have in        139    00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.400    common they are symbols of our common        140    00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.639    humanity and and a rebuke even to        141    00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.440    humorous        142    00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:36.840    cynicism Martin Luther        143    00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.240    King basically said he lived the way he        144    00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.000    did because we were all caught in what        145    00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.520    he called an inescapable web of        146    00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.520    mutuality Nelson Mandela the world's        147    00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.400    greatest living example of that I        148    00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.759    believe comes from a tribe in South        149    00:06:55.759 --> 00:07:00.080    Africa the Sosa who call it Ubuntu in        150    00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.560    English I am because you        151    00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:07.360    are        152    00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.599    that led Mother Teresa from        153    00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:12.879    Albania to spend her life with the        154    00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:15.479    poorest people on Earth in        155    00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:19.639    Kolkata it led Bono from his Rock stage        156    00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:22.440    to worry about innocent babies dying of        157    00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.240    AIDS and poor people with good Minds who        158    00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.680    never got a chance to follow their        159    00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.680    dreams        160    00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.319    this is a really fascinating time to be        161    00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:38.080    a college senior I was looking at all of        162    00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.879    you wishing I could start over again and        163    00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:40.879    thinking you know I'd let you be        164    00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:43.919    president if you'd let me be        165    00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:48.080    21 I'd take a chance on making it all        166    00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.759    over again if I could do it        167    00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:54.039    again but I mean this think what an        168    00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:55.879    exciting time it is all this explosion        169    00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:57.120    of        170    00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.159    knowledge just in the last couple of        171    00:07:59.159 --> 00:08:01.919    weeks before I came here I read that        172    00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:03.520    thanks to the sequencing of the human        173    00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.720    genome the ongoing research has        174    00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.800    identified two markers which seem to be        175    00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.919    high predictors of diabetes which as you        176    00:08:10.919 --> 00:08:12.440    heard is a very important thing to me        177    00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.400    because it's now predicted that one in        178    00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.199    three children born in the United States        179    00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:19.560    in this decade will develop diabetes we        180    00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.960    run the risk that we could be raising        181    00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.400    the first generation of kids that live        182    00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.400    shorter lives than their        183    00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.759    parents not because we're hungry but        184    00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:28.000    because we don't eat the right things        185    00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.039    and we don't exercise        186    00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:33.519    but this is a big deal then right after        187    00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:38.080    that I saw that through our powerful        188    00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.519    telescopes we have identified a planet        189    00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:42.440    orbiting one of the hundred Stars        190    00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.279    closest to our solar system that appears        191    00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:47.279    to have the atmospheric        192    00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:49.959    conditions so similar to ours that life        193    00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:52.680    could actually be possible        194    00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.320    there alas even though it's close to us        195    00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.640    in terms of the great Universe it's        196    00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.680    still 20 million light years away        197    00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.680    unreachable in the lifetime of any young        198    00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.320    person so unless there's a budding        199    00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.240    astrophysicist in the        200    00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.519    class that wants to get married in a        201    00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:11.680    hurry and then commit three generations        202    00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.440    and take another couple with        203    00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.600    him we'll have to wait for them to come        204    00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.120    to        205    00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.160    us it's an exciting time it's also        206    00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.040    exciting because of all the        207    00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.480    diversity uh if you look around this        208    00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.040    audience I was thinking I wonder how        209    00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.040    different this crowd would have looked        210    00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.640    if someone like me had been giving this        211    00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.560    speech 30 years        212    00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.880    ago and how much        213    00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.440    more interesting it is for all of        214    00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.440    us        215    00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.440    it's frustrating        216    00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.040    time because for all the opportunity        217    00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.640    there's a lot of        218    00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.959    inequality there's a lot of insecurity        219    00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:56.880    and there's a lot of instability and        220    00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.680    unsustainability half the world's people        221    00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.600    still live on that less than two bucks a        222    00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.040    day a billion on less than a dollar a        223    00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.560    day a billion people go to bed hungry        224    00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.720    tonight a billion people won't get a        225    00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.120    clean glass of water today or any day in        226    00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.480    their        227    00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.839    lives one in four of all the people who        228    00:10:12.839 --> 00:10:14.760    die this year will die from AIDS TV        229    00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.800    malaria and infections related to dirty        230    00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.240    water nobody in America dies of any of        231    00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.800    that except people whose AIDS medicine        232    00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.000    don't doesn't work anymore        233    00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.120    are people who decline to follow the        234    00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.640    prescribed regime        235    00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.079    in the United States in the last decade        236    00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:36.600    we have had six years of economic growth        237    00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.279    and all-time high the stock market a        238    00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:40.639    40-year high corporate profits workers        239    00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:42.000    are doing better every year with        240    00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.279    productivity but median wages are        241    00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:46.519    stagnant and there's actually been in        242    00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:49.440    all this so-called recovery a 4%        243    00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.600    increase in the percentage of people        244    00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.639    working full-time falling below the        245    00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:56.160    poverty line and a 4% increase in the        246    00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.120    percentage of people working who with        247    00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.000    their families have lost their health        248    00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.399    insurance it's an unequal        249    00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:06.519    time it's an uncertain insecure time        250    00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:09.040    because we're all vulnerable to Terror        251    00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.360    to weapons of mass destruction to Global        252    00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.519    pandemics like Aven        253    00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.279    influenza we all make fun of the modern        254    00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:19.839    media and culture all the time but I        255    00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:21.200    thought it was interesting in my little        256    00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.680    house in chapaqua where I stay home        257    00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.959    alone rooting for the        258    00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:30.240    candidate I I watched the evening news        259    00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.519    in the last few months and it's        260    00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:34.760    interesting somehow clawing its way        261    00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.600    through the stories of the latest crime        262    00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.519    uh in Endeavor in our neighborhood and        263    00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:44.160    whether Britney Spear's hair has grown        264    00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.360    out or        265    00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.680    not I have learned that there were        266    00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.279    chickens in Romania bul uh Romania India        267    00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:52.920    and        268    00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.680    Indonesia identified with Aven influenza        269    00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.000    and that every chicken within 3 square        270    00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.360    miles those those unfortunate ones was        271    00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.800    eradicated on the Evening News competing        272    00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.760    with Britney Spears and crime why that's        273    00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.000    a good thing because of the shared        274    00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.600    insecurity we        275    00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.240    feel you all saw it this week and all        276    00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.760    the stories about the terrorist attack        277    00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.320    being thwarted in Kennedy Airport I        278    00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.920    remember a few months ago everybody I        279    00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.279    knew was shaking their head when we        280    00:12:22.279 --> 00:12:25.320    found out that there was a plot in        281    00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.800    London to put explosive chemicals in a        282    00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.880    baby bottle to make it look like formula        283    00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.839    to evade the airport        284    00:12:32.839 --> 00:12:35.360    inspections and every time I ask        285    00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.959    somebody I said did you feel a chill go        286    00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:38.959    up and down your spine they said yeah        287    00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:41.199    they did CU they can imagine being on        288    00:12:41.199 --> 00:12:43.880    the airplane or in my case I can imagine        289    00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.680    my daughter who has to travel a lot on        290    00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.199    her job being on the airplane but here's        291    00:12:49.199 --> 00:12:52.480    what I want to tell you about        292    00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.360    that the inequality is        293    00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:01.120    fixable and the insecurity is manageable        294    00:13:01.199 --> 00:13:02.800    we're going to really have to go some in        295    00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.440    the 21st century to see political        296    00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.240    violence claim as many innocent lives as        297    00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.000    it did in the 20th century keep in mind        298    00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.160    you had what 12 million people killed in        299    00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.440    World War I somewhere between 15 and 20        300    00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.360    million in World War II 6 million in the        301    00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.160    Holocaust 6 million Jews 3 million        302    00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.600    others 20 million in the political        303    00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.639    purges in the former Soviet Union        304    00:13:23.639 --> 00:13:25.600    between the two world wars and one        305    00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.079    afterward 2 million in Cambodia alone        306    00:13:29.079 --> 00:13:31.199    millions in Tribal wars in Africa an        307    00:13:31.199 --> 00:13:33.079    Untold but large number in the Chinese        308    00:13:33.079 --> 00:13:35.279    Cultural Revolution I mean we're going        309    00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:37.639    to have to really get after it if you        310    00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:41.079    expect your generation to claim as many        311    00:13:41.079 --> 00:13:43.519    Innocents from political violence as was        312    00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:45.240    claimed in the 20th century the        313    00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.880    difference is you think it could be you        314    00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.680    this        315    00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.079    time because of the interdependence of        316    00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.639    the        317    00:13:51.639 --> 00:13:57.720    world so yes it's insecure but it's        318    00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.240    manageable it's also an unsustainable        319    00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.360    world because of climate change resource        320    00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.519    depletion and the fact that between now        321    00:14:04.519 --> 00:14:06.920    and 2050 the world's supposed to grow        322    00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.120    from 6 and a half to 9 billion        323    00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.519    people with most of the growth in the        324    00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:13.720    country's least able to handle it under        325    00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.600    today's conditions never mind        326    00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.120    those that's all fixable        327    00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.959    too so is climate change a problem is        328    00:14:21.959 --> 00:14:23.480    resource depletion a        329    00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.800    problem it's poverty and the fact that        330    00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.800    130 million kids never go to school and        331    00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.720    all this disease that I work on a        332    00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.800    problem you        333    00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.320    bet it        334    00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.199    is but I believe the most important        335    00:14:36.199 --> 00:14:39.000    problem is the way people think about it        336    00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.920    and each other and        337    00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.040    themselves the world is a was today in        338    00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.759    political religious almost psychological        339    00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.519    conflicts which require us to divide up        340    00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:59.199    and demonize people who aren't us        341    00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.880    and every one of them in one way or the        342    00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.800    other is premised on a very simple        343    00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.320    idea that our differences are more        344    00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.399    important than our common        345    00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:14.720    Humanity I would argue that Mother        346    00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.199    Teresa was asked here Bono was asked        347    00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:18.880    here and Martin Luther King was asked        348    00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.000    here because this class believed that        349    00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.639    they were people who thought our common        350    00:15:23.639 --> 00:15:25.920    Humanity was more important than our        351    00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.920    differences        352    00:15:36.199 --> 00:15:40.920    and so look this Harvard degree and your        353    00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.360    your Incredible Minds and your spirits        354    00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.639    that I've gotten a little sense of today        355    00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:50.279    this gives you virtually Limitless        356    00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.800    possibilities but you have to        357    00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.920    decide how to think about all        358    00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.560    this and what to do with your own life        359    00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.600    in terms of what you really        360    00:16:05.759 --> 00:16:08.639    think I hope that you will share Martin        361    00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:10.440    Luther King's        362    00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:15.759    dream Embrace Mandela's Spirit of        363    00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.279    reconciliation support Bono's concern        364    00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:20.519    for the        365    00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:23.440    poor and follow Mother Teresa's life        366    00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.720    into some active service        367    00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.600    ordinary people have more power to do        368    00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.720    public good than ever before because of        369    00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.560    the rise of non-governmental        370    00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.399    organizations because of the global        371    00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:40.480    media        372    00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.720    culture because of the internet which        373    00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.040    gives people of modest means the power        374    00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.240    if they all agree to change the        375    00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.920    world when former President Bush and I        376    00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.759    were asked to work on the        377    00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:57.160    tsunami before we did the Katrina work        378    00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.160    Americans many of whom could not the        379    00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.120    Maldives or Sri Lanka on a map gave $        380    00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.199    1.2 billion doar to Tsunami 8 30% of our        381    00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:08.640    households gave half of them gave over        382    00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.079    the        383    00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.079    Internet which means you don't even have        384    00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:13.880    to be rich to change the world if enough        385    00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.520    people agree with        386    00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.799    you but we have to do        387    00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.679    this citizen service is a tradition in        388    00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:29.919    our country about as old as Harvard        389    00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:32.200    and certainly older than the government        390    00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.120    Benjamin Franklin organized the first        391    00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.160    volunteer fire department in        392    00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.640    Philadelphia 40 years before The        393    00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.440    Constitution was        394    00:17:42.799 --> 00:17:45.760    ratified when dville came here in 1835        395    00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.720    he talked among other things about how        396    00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.600    he was amazed that Americans just were        397    00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.640    always willing to step up and do        398    00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.640    something not wait for someone else to        399    00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.919    do it now we have in America a million        400    00:17:57.919 --> 00:17:59.720    10,000        401    00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.880    non-governmental groups not counting        402    00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.640    355,000 religious groups most of whom        403    00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.200    are involved in some sort of work to        404    00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.320    help other        405    00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.159    people India has a million registered        406    00:18:13.159 --> 00:18:15.400    over a half a million active China has        407    00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.720    280,000 registered and twice that many        408    00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.120    not registered because they don't want        409    00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.559    to be        410    00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:25.919    confined Russia has 400,000 so many that        411    00:18:25.919 --> 00:18:27.559    President Putin is trying to restrict        412    00:18:27.559 --> 00:18:28.880    them I wish you wouldn't do that but        413    00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.840    it's a high class problem there were no        414    00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.600    NOS in Russia or China when I became        415    00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.120    president in        416    00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.760    1993 all over the world we have people        417    00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:43.000    who know that they can do things to        418    00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.720    change but again I will say to all of        419    00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:53.320    you there is no challenge we        420    00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.240    face no barrier to having your        421    00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.400    grandchildren here on this beautiful        422    00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.400    site 50 years from now more        423    00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.280    profound than the        424    00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.480    ideological and emotional        425    00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:15.679    divide which continues to demean our        426    00:19:15.679 --> 00:19:18.400    common life and undermine our ability to        427    00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.600    solve our common problems the simple        428    00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.039    idea that our differences are more        429    00:19:22.039 --> 00:19:25.159    important than our common Humanity when        430    00:19:25.159 --> 00:19:26.760    the human genome was        431    00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.000    sequenced and the most interesting thing        432    00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000    to me as a non-scientist we finished it        433    00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.320    my last year I was President I really        434    00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.880    rode hert on this thing and kept        435    00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.280    throwing more money at it the most        436    00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.840    interesting thing to me was the        437    00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.320    discovery that in this human beings with        438    00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.240    there three billion        439    00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.159    genomes are        440    00:19:48.159 --> 00:19:51.679    99.9% identical genetically so if you        441    00:19:51.679 --> 00:19:54.440    look around this vast crowd        442    00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.679    today at the the military caps and the B        443    00:19:58.679 --> 00:20:02.559    basball caps and the cowboy hats and the        444    00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:04.760    turbin if you look at all the different        445    00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.840    colors of        446    00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.799    skin all the heights all the        447    00:20:09.799 --> 00:20:13.080    widths all the everything it's all        448    00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.840    rooted in one/ tenth of        449    00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.559    1% of our genetic        450    00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:21.320    makeup don't you think it's        451    00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.480    interesting that not just people you        452    00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.559    find        453    00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:27.679    appalling but all the rest of us spend        454    00:20:27.679 --> 00:20:30.200    90% of our lives thinking about that        455    00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.880    1/10th of        456    00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.240    1% I mean don't we        457    00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.400    all how much of the laugh lines in the        458    00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.080    speeches were about        459    00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.320    that at least I didn't go to Yale        460    00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.960    right that brown gag was        461    00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.840    hilarious right all those things but        462    00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.799    it's all the same deal isn't it I mean        463    00:20:53.799 --> 00:20:56.799    the intellectual premises that only        464    00:20:56.799 --> 00:20:58.000    thing that really matters about our        465    00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.320    lives are the distinctions we can        466    00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.280    draw indeed one of the crassest elements        467    00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.720    of modern culture all these sort of talk        468    00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.279    shows and even a lot of political        469    00:21:12.279 --> 00:21:13.960    journalism that sort of focus on this        470    00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.840    kind of shallow judgmentalism that try        471    00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.080    to Define everybody down by the worst        472    00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.000    moment in their lives and it all is        473    00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.039    about well no matter whatever is wrong        474    00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:25.960    with me I'm not        475    00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.080    that and yet you asked Martin Luther        476    00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.240    King Mother        477    00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.799    Teresa and Bono to come        478    00:21:35.799 --> 00:21:38.840    here Nelson Mandela is the most admired        479    00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.600    person in the        480    00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:44.720    world I got tickled the other night I I        481    00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.320    ran I went up at a restaurant in New        482    00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.799    York with a bunch of friends of mine and        483    00:21:47.799 --> 00:21:49.400    I looked over at two tables away and        484    00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.039    there was Rush        485    00:21:51.039 --> 00:21:53.880    LMO and who said a few mad things about        486    00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.520    me so I went up and shook hands with him        487    00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.720    and said hello and met his dinner guest        488    00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.600    and I came just that close to telling        489    00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.520    him we were 99.9% the        490    00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.320    same        491    00:22:11.679 --> 00:22:14.159    but I didn't want to ruin the Poor Man's        492    00:22:14.159 --> 00:22:16.159    Dessert so I let it        493    00:22:16.159 --> 00:22:18.880    go now we're laughing about this but        494    00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.200    next month I'm making my annual track to        495    00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.200    Africa to see the work of my AIDS and        496    00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.600    development projects and to celebrate        497    00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.520    with Nelson Mandela his birthday is 89        498    00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.120    don't know how many more you'll have and        499    00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.799    when I think that I might be 99.9% the        500    00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:39.640    same as him I can't even fathom        501    00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:46.039    it so I say that to        502    00:22:46.039 --> 00:22:48.400    you do we have all these other problems        503    00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.799    this darur a tragedy do I wish America        504    00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:52.559    would adopt sensible climate change        505    00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:54.520    regulation do I hate the fact that        506    00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.080    ideologues in the government doctored        507    00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.320    scientific reports do I disagree with        508    00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.320    the th000 things that are going        509    00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.520    absolutely but it all        510    00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.360    flows from the idea that we can violate        511    00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.039    Elemental standards of learning and        512    00:23:10.039 --> 00:23:11.440    knowledge and reason and even the        513    00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.720    humanity of our fellow human beings        514    00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.679    because our differences matter        515    00:23:15.679 --> 00:23:18.080    more that's what make you worship power        516    00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.200    over purpose our differences matter        517    00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.760    more one of the greatest things that's        518    00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.880    happened to me in the last few years is        519    00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:26.960    doing all this work with former        520    00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.840    President Bush you know he's I ought to        521    00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.240    be doing this I'm healthy and not        522    00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.080    totally Antiquated he's 82 years old        523    00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.600    still jumping out of airplanes and still        524    00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.960    doing stuff like        525    00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.720    this and I love the guy I'm sorry for        526    00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.080    all the Die Hard Democrats in the        527    00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.440    audience I just        528    00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.559    do        529    00:23:45.559 --> 00:23:48.760    and life is all about seeing things new        530    00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.120    every        531    00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.600    day and I'll just close with two stories        532    00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.440    one from Asia one from Africa and I'm        533    00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.440    telling you all the details don't matter        534    00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.840    as much as this        535    00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.000    after George Bush and I did the tsunami        536    00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.880    we got so into this disaster work that        537    00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.720    kofan asked him to oversee the un's        538    00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.000    efforts in uh in Pakistan after the        539    00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.799    earthquake which you acknowledge today        540    00:24:12.799 --> 00:24:14.720    and asked me to stay on as a Sunami        541    00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.640    coordinator for two        542    00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.159    years so on my next and last trip to a        543    00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:22.520    and Indonesia the by far the hardest hit        544    00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.679    Place quarter of a million people        545    00:24:24.679 --> 00:24:27.960    killed I went to one of these uh refugee        546    00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.720    camps where in the        547    00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.840    sweltering        548    00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.200    heat several thousand people were still        549    00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.360    living in tents highly        550    00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.559    uncomfortable and my job was to go there        551    00:24:40.559 --> 00:24:42.200    and basically listen to them complain        552    00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.559    and figure out what to do about it and        553    00:24:43.559 --> 00:24:45.120    how to get them out of there more        554    00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.480    quickly so every one of these camps        555    00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.120    elected a camp        556    00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.039    leader and when I appeared I was        557    00:24:52.039 --> 00:24:54.520    introduced to my young interpreter young        558    00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.159    Indonesian woman and to this the guy who        559    00:24:58.159 --> 00:25:02.039    was the camp leader and his wife and his        560    00:25:02.039 --> 00:25:05.679    son and they smiled said hello and then        561    00:25:05.679 --> 00:25:08.480    I looked down at this little boy and I        562    00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.399    literally could not breathe I think he's        563    00:25:10.399 --> 00:25:13.880    the most beautiful child I ever        564    00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.320    saw and I said to my young interpreter I        565    00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.520    said I believe that's the most beautiful        566    00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.240    boy I ever saw in my life she said yes        567    00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.600    he's very beautiful and before the        568    00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.559    tsunami he had nine brothers and sisters        569    00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:29.440    and now they're all gone        570    00:25:30.399 --> 00:25:33.320    so the wife and the son excused        571    00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.559    themselves and the father who had lost        572    00:25:35.559 --> 00:25:38.080    his nine children proceeded to take me        573    00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.039    on a two-hour tour of this Camp he had a        574    00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:44.279    smile on his face he never talked about        575    00:25:44.279 --> 00:25:45.679    anything but what the people in that        576    00:25:45.679 --> 00:25:48.840    camp needed he gave no hint of what had        577    00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.640    happened to him in the grief that he        578    00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.840    bore we get to the end of the tour it's        579    00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.120    the health clinic in the        580    00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:01.360    camp I look up and there is his wife a        581    00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.200    mother who'd lost nine of her 10        582    00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.760    children holding a little bitty baby        583    00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.279    less than a week old the newest born        584    00:26:08.279 --> 00:26:12.360    baby in the camp and she told me I'm        585    00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.960    going to get in trouble for telling this        586    00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.559    she told me that in Indonesian culture        587    00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:18.679    when a woman has a baby she gets to go        588    00:26:18.679 --> 00:26:20.679    to bed for 40 days and everyone Waits on        589    00:26:20.679 --> 00:26:22.320    her hand and        590    00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.520    foot she doesn't get up nothing happens        591    00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.120    and then on the 40th Day the mother gets        592    00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.799    up out of bed goes back to work and        593    00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:31.919    doing her life and they named the baby        594    00:26:31.919 --> 00:26:34.279    so this child was less than a week old        595    00:26:34.279 --> 00:26:35.880    so this mother who had lost her nine        596    00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.600    children is here holding this baby and        597    00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.240    she says to        598    00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.840    me this is our newest born        599    00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.640    baby and we want you to name        600    00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.720    him little        601    00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.399    boy so I looked at her and I said        602    00:26:53.399 --> 00:26:55.919    through my interpreter I said do you        603    00:26:55.919 --> 00:27:00.000    have a name for New Beginning        604    00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.320    and she explained and the woman said        605    00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.840    something back and The Interpreter said        606    00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.600    yes luckily for you in        607    00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.000    Indonesian the word for        608    00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.720    Dawn is a boy's        609    00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.080    name and the mother just said to me we        610    00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.919    will call this child        611    00:27:16.919 --> 00:27:22.919    Dawn and he will symbolize our new        612    00:27:23.279 --> 00:27:26.080    beginning you shouldn't have to meet        613    00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.640    people that lose nine of their 10        614    00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.080    children cherish the one they got left        615    00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.080    and name a newborn baby Dawn to realize        616    00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.000    that what we have in common is more        617    00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.159    important than what divides        618    00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:41.159    us        619    00:27:42.919 --> 00:27:45.660    you're        620    00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.320    [Music]        621    00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:51.559    this and I leave you with this        622    00:27:52.279 --> 00:27:54.519    thought when Martin Luther King was        623    00:27:54.519 --> 00:27:56.840    invited here in 1968 the country was        624    00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:00.120    still a wash in        625    00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.159    racism the next decade it was a wash in        626    00:28:03.159 --> 00:28:05.559    sexism and after that in        627    00:28:05.559 --> 00:28:08.000    homophobia and occasionally those things        628    00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000    rear their ugly head along the way but        629    00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.240    by and large nobody in this class is        630    00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.760    going to carry those chains around        631    00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.799    through life but nobody gets out for        632    00:28:17.799 --> 00:28:21.360    free and everyone has        633    00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.559    Temptations the great        634    00:28:23.559 --> 00:28:26.120    Temptation for all of        635    00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:30.120    you is to believe        636    00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.559    that the on10th of 1% of you which is        637    00:28:33.559 --> 00:28:35.760    different and which brought you here and        638    00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.240    which can bring you great riches or        639    00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.000    whatever else you        640    00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.799    want is really the sum of who you are        641    00:28:42.799 --> 00:28:45.159    and that you deserve your good fate and        642    00:28:45.159 --> 00:28:48.159    others deserve their bad        643    00:28:48.159 --> 00:28:51.480    one that is the Trap into which you must        644    00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.360    not        645    00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.080    fall Warren Buffett's just about to give        646    00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.200    away 99% of his money because he said        647    00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.000    most of it he made because of where he        648    00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.799    was born and when he was born it was a        649    00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:06.360    lucky accident and his work was rewarded        650    00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.799    in this time and place more richly than        651    00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:11.320    the work of teachers and police officers        652    00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.279    and nurses and doctors and people who        653    00:29:14.279 --> 00:29:17.279    cared for those who deserve to be cared        654    00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:20.200    for so he just going to give it away and        655    00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.799    still with less than 1% left have more        656    00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:24.080    than he could ever        657    00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.200    spend because he realizes        658    00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.519    that it wasn't all due to the onet of        659    00:29:32.519 --> 00:29:35.519    1% and that his common Humanity requires        660    00:29:35.519 --> 00:29:38.159    him to give money to those for whom it        661    00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:40.840    will mean much        662    00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.559    more in the central Highlands in Africa        663    00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:46.320    where I        664    00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.919    work when people meet each other walking

 candidates and political consultants        14    00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.710    like James Carville to determine what it        15    00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.280    takes to put a woman in the

 here this afternoon with a lot of        45    00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.260    questions on your minds        46    00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.000    well my Beirut table fit in the car will        47    00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.430    there be a goodie bag filled with candy        48    00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.870    attached to my diploma and who is this        49    00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.790    Clinton guy that everybody's talking        50    00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.980    about I too have a question will the        51    00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.930    huge candy filled goodie bag that        52    00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.760    President Clinton gave me sit in the car        53    00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.620    I used to have a lot more questions but        54    00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.930    as a Women's Studies concentrator Larry        55    00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.549    Summers answered most of mine a while        56    00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.910    ago        57    00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.610    yet in the midst of Senior Week        58    00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.580    another question dawned on me I don't        59    00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.250    actually remember when maybe it was        60    00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.080    during one of Nate Burns 300        61    00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.310    performances at the senior talent show        62    00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.580    but anyway I started to wonder did        63    00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.740    Harvard live up to the expectations that        64    00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.900    we had when we arrived here four years        65    00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.820    ago the way I see it expectations are a        66    00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.640    lot like babies people sometimes have        67    00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.080    them and there's not a lot you can do        68    00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.410    about it I'm sorry I didn't mean to get        69    00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.590    all deep and reflective on you I know        70    00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.270    that at least half of you are still        71    00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.700    hungover and the other half have no idea        72    00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.710    who the hell Nate Dern is okay so why        73    00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.990    don't we do this instead I'll offer you        74    00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.050    my take on the whole expectations thing        75    00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.810    and then you can either agree with me        76    00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.350    but never admit it or disagree with me        77    00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.280    and openly mock me afterward it's just        78    00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.609    like being in section only this time you        79    00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.280    aren't sitting beside the smelly kid        80    00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.010    well I mean at least one of you is        81    00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.660    sitting beside him but please don't        82    00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.630    raise your hand if you are his family is        83    00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.419    here and this is supposed to be a happy        84    00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:39.290    day I expected like many of you I'm sure        85    00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.450    that being at Harvard would make me        86    00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.630    smarter otherwise this is the most        87    00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.669    expensive four-year slumber party I've        88    00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.600    ever been to        89    00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.669    there's no denying that most of us learn        90    00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.220    some stuff while we were here before        91    00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.699    coming to Harvard I for one had no idea        92    00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.599    that pickles and cucumbers were in any        93    00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:08.800    way related don't worry though        94    00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.759    I've got that all under control now        95    00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:16.590    pickles are boys cucumbers are girls and        96    00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.639    cucumbers aren't very good at science        97    00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.830    but I gotta level with you I really        98    00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.270    didn't turn out as smart as I thought I        99    00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.810    would        100    00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.240    Harvard ain't offering no refund I'll        101    00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.800    tell you that for free okay if you're        102    00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.120    sitting there irritated right now        103    00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.650    because I used a double negative        104    00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.900    construction ain't no well demanding        105    00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.800    that Harvard offer a money-back        106    00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.510    guarantee on the whole smartness thing        107    00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.750    you probably got your money's worth in        108    00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.720    fact I bet you're graduating summa        109    00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.510    mocha latte or whatever with a joint        110    00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.220    concentration a secondary field a        111    00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.320    foreign language citation a health        112    00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.020    policy certificate and a rash formatter        113    00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:12.760    lather disappointed as I am that this        114    00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.030    whole education thing didn't work out        115    00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.070    for some of us I don't think we should        116    00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.450    feel all that bad about it I'll tell you        117    00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:20.460    why        118    00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.370    how many people in the world can say        119    00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.140    that they have a thorough knowledge of        120    00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.320    how justice operates among dinosaurs and        121    00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.020    their relatives in Chinese imaginary        122    00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.540    space not too many        123    00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:43.120    thank you very much core curriculum in        124    00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.650    any case blaming Harvard for the whole        125    00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.870    smartness fiasco makes me feel rather        126    00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.270    like the old woman who lived in a glass        127    00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.280    shoe and threw stones at her many        128    00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.500    children or whatever that idiomatic        129    00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:02.140    expression is you see I expected and        130    00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.690    frankly I'm sure Harvard did too        131    00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.420    that we would be super diligent students        132    00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:14.800    and do all of the assigned reading that        133    00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.540    didn't last very long we quickly found        134    00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.620    alternative ways to read as mere        135    00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.690    amateurs during sophomore and junior        136    00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.830    years we skimmed the text poured over        137    00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:30.880    sparknotes        138    00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.550    and liberally borrowed language from        139    00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.050    Wikipedia        140    00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.370    but as esteemed seniors what did we do        141    00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.990    well we read just one footnote in the        142    00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.900    text and then we came to class and made        143    00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:59.879    a comment something like this yeah so uh        144    00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:02.729    I hear what you're saying about fuko's        145    00:08:02.729 --> 00:08:04.409    construction of discursive power        146    00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:05.999    structures but I think you're blatantly        147    00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:07.650    disregarding is often referenced to        148    00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.120    state sanctioned bio power in the        149    00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.400    footnote on page 115 did anyone else        150    00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.469    make note of that or have reflect on it        151    00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.010    this is followed by a steady evil glare        152    00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.250    at the freshmen who were earlier making        153    00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:35.290    obnoxious legitimate comments thankfully        154    00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:38.419    we all know that intelligence isn't        155    00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:41.150    everything in life good looks count for        156    00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.240    a whole lot too so for those of us who        157    00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.910    didn't turn out so well on the whole        158    00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.920    smartness dimension Harvard has done        159    00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.690    something really clever to ensure our        160    00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.120    customer satisfaction which is to        161    00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.990    convince us that we are indeed        162    00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.620    physically attractive unfortunately this        163    00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.350    only holds true in comparison with one        164    00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.680    another        165    00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.580    remember when you got your freshman        166    00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.160    Facebook and you sat there flipping        167    00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.710    through it judgmentally and then you        168    00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.280    exclaimed aloud to your roommates there        169    00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.740    are like seriously only four hot people        170    00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.730    at this whole school all the while        171    00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.950    thinking to yourself that you were        172    00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:40.600    definitely one of them newsflash all of        173    00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.610    your roommates we're thinking the same        174    00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.730    thing that they were one of the four        175    00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.570    fine pieces of ass on this campus and        176    00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:56.740    you had five roommates undeterred        177    00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.500    however by the vagaries of statistics        178    00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.750    and the reality of what I actually look        179    00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.720    like my newfound awareness of my absurd        180    00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.420    good looks generated the expectation        181    00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.150    that I would find my soulmate at Harvard        182    00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:17.230    that high SAT score inquiry but upwardly        183    00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.470    mobile special someone        184    00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:29.880    meant just for me or at the very least        185    00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.300    some sort of big man on campus you know        186    00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.190    the kind that gets scoped in FM and        187    00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.810    doesn't need to cut out the article I        188

ready to        193    00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.550    saunter over to the admissions office        194    00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.740    and tell them how well Cornelius van der        195

  bitter        198    00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:24.940    and it's because I am even if I was not        199    00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.700    meant to find true love here I still        200    00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.089    expected to meet a new diverse group of        201    00:11:31.089 --> 00:11:34.360    incredible Harvard students every single        202    00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:40.390    day of college yet on high noon on        203    00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:44.970    October 4th 2003 we all simultaneously        204    00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.470    stopped

     212    00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.200    hall even if they look like Bill Clinton        213    00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.850    and are holding big bags of candy        214    00:12:20.820 -->

freshman dean's office as a        217    00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:37.030    Canadian I expected the Harvard of        218    00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:41.500    America to embody ideals of liberty and        219    00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.740    freedom and was surprised to find        220    00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.750    instead that Harvard ruthlessly        221    00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:51.670    dominates our free will no rational        222    00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.960    human being would choose to eat over        223    00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.320    2,000 meals from HUDs even with a        224    00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:04.180    regular Felipe's vitamin supplement so        225    00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:07.020    why did we do it        226    00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.690    Pavlovian conditioning you know how when        227    00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:11.860    you swipe into the dining hall little        228    00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:16.570    machine goes and all of a sudden saliva        229    00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.220    pours into your mouth and you're on an        230    00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.500    unrelenting quest for golden nuggets        231    00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.550    like they're the last source of        232    00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:26.380    sustenance on earth that's right little        233    00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.350

old and        236    00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:45.570    they're still making us drink kool-aid        237    00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.380    something really isn't right here and I        238

00:14:43.180    great expectations but on the whole I        253    00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.320    think it did a damn fine job        254    00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.959    bear in mind however that we only have a        255    00:14:49.959 --> 00:14:53.440    few more hours left together so you do        256    00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.870    best to find those folks in our class        257    00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.550    who are going to be rich and powerful        258    00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:02.670    and then kick them in the shins        259    00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.930    it's the only way to guarantee they'll        260    00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:17.320    remember you congratulations good luck        261    00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.090    and thank you        262

00:09:57.800    several years ago at the behest of a        189    00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.399    seminar being held at the asmin        190    00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:04.279    Institute do nothing

  00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.120    about me assume there is at least one        194    00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.720    other side or version to every story        195    00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.560    assume the viewer is as smart and as        196    00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.320    caring and as good a person as I am        197    00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.680    assume the same about all people on whom        198    00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.160    I report assume personal lives are A        199    00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.760    Private Matter until a legitimate turn        200    00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.440    in the story absolutely mandates        201    00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.200    otherwise carefully separate opinion and        202    00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.600    Analysis from straight news stories and        203    00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.720    clearly label everything do not use        204    00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.240    anonymous sources or blind quotes except        205    00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.079    on rare and Monumental occasions no one        206    00:10:51.079 --> 00:10:54.880    should ever be allowed to attack another        207    00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.220    anonymously and finally        208    00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:05.519    [Applause]        209    00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:10.959    finally I am not in the entertainment        210    00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.639    business I have come with only one major        211    00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:24.399    commencement like point to make you'll        212    00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:26.399    be delighted to hear and let me put it        213    00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:30.480    simply and directly I believe believe we        214    00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.120    should consider adopting some form of        215    00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.000    national service no not a return to the        216    00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.399    military draft something entirely        217    00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:43.920    different and completely new for US        218    00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.600    national service in its fullest meaning        219    00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.680    my reasons have to do mostly with what I        220    00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.399    see as an urgent need to address the        221    00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:55.279    growing state of disconnection we have        222    00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:58.279    in our country today but it is based        223    00:11:58.279 --> 00:12:00.880    also on my personal experiences which        224    00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.959    flow directly from something else I did        225    00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:05.600    on my graduation day 50 years ago        226    00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.839    besides listen to a man in a red tie        227    00:12:08.839 --> 00:12:11.480    speak I went with my parents from the        228    00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.639    commencement ceremony to a building on        229    00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:16.519    campus and I raised my right hand and        230    00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:18.920    was sworn in as a second lieutenant in        231    00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.880    the United States Marine Corps I spent        232    00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.720    the next three years as an infantry        233    00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.399    officer mostly in the Far East it was        234    00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:29.320    between the Korean and Vietnam Wars I        235    00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:33.000    saw no combat fired no rounds in Anger        236    00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.160    had none fired at me had no        237    00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.000    roadside bombs kill fellow Marines of        238    00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.959    mine I was spared events like that that        239    00:12:43.959 --> 00:12:46.560    might have triggered losing control to        240    00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.680    going over the top of civilized Behavior        241    00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.720    into angry barbarism as has been charged        242    00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:56.440    to a group of Marines these days in Iraq        243    00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.160    but my Marine Service was a        244    00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.560    life-changing experience for me a        245    00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.160    positive one that had I not had I most        246    00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.760    likely would not be standing here today        247    00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.360    because I would not be a person deemed        248    00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.000    worthy for such an honor I went into the        249    00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.079    military because I had to join on your        250    00:13:17.079 --> 00:13:20.040    own or be drafted was the choice I chose        251    00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.079    the Marines for personal not heroic or        252    00:13:24.079 --> 00:13:27.199    as you can clearly see physique        253    00:13:27.199 --> 00:13:30.279    reasons my dad had been a marine and so        254    00:13:30.279 --> 00:13:33.680    had my brother so I would be a marine        255    00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.320    that required service changed me and the        256    00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.000    life I have led ever since my travels up        257    00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.760    till then had been restricted pretty        258    00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.760    much to Central Kansas Eastern Oklahoma        259    00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.800    and South Texas my mode of Transport was        260    00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.320    mostly on Trailways buses but as a        261    00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.120    marine I took my first plane ride to        262    00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.880    Washington DC and then on eventually to        263    00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.800    California and and to Japan and to        264    00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.040    okanawa and to Taiwan and to the        265    00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.519    Philippines and to essentially the world        266    00:14:08.519 --> 00:14:10.399    my friends and acquaintances up till        267    00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:12.880    then had been mostly people who looked        268    00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.320    talked and thought like me but now I was        269    00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.360    eating drinking sleeping sweating and        270    00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.199    running up down running up and down        271    00:14:20.199 --> 00:14:23.240    Hills with and listening to and        272    00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.720    depending on people who had little in        273    00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.480    common with me some spoke and looked        274    00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.800    different most were larger and stronger        275    00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.680    than me a few smaller some were smarter        276    00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.720    others Dumber some were Rich others poor        277    00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.000    some were wonderful people others were        278    00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.800    less        279    00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.160    so some wouldn't hurt a        280    00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.399    fly others sometimes deserve to be hurt        281    00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:46.240    by        282    00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.800    flies in that diverse company I learned        283    00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.079    to be responsible for others I learned        284    00:14:54.079 --> 00:14:57.320    to depend on others and to understand        285    00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.160    what being dependent on by others really        286    00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.600    meant I learned that there was more to        287    00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.639    the world than me and my kind that there        288    00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:12.639    was more to my life than me me me and me        289    00:15:12.639 --> 00:15:15.000    I learned there was joy and satisfaction        290    00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.839    to be had by looking past the Mirror by        291    00:15:18.839 --> 00:15:20.759    serving common interests rather than        292    00:15:20.759 --> 00:15:23.519    only those of self I am grateful my        293    00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:25.800    country forced me to serve my country        294    00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.560    not for my country's sake but for my own        295    00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.199    my three years of service connected me        296    00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:33.600    to the rest of the world the world        297    00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.120    outside myself and the        298    00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.680    connection has been permanent the        299    00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.720    experience also left me with a firm        300    00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.000    conviction that beyond the benefits to        301    00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.959    individuals connecting and connections        302    00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:49.959    are essential for our Democratic Society        303    00:15:49.959 --> 00:15:53.880    to work and speaking now as a journalist        304    00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.120    whose job it's been to pay attention to        305    00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.600    such things I have never seen it more        306    00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.720    disconnected from each other than we are        307    00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.560    right now we are splintering off into        308    00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.079    segments interest groups lobbies Target        309    00:16:08.079 --> 00:16:11.279    audiences blogs boxes our racial        310    00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:13.399    cultural and religious differences        311    00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:16.000    always our great strength have become an        312    00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.160    instrument in our great        313    00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.839    disconnection our growing economic        314    00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:23.839    differences as Larry put it brilliantly        315    00:16:23.839 --> 00:16:26.600    are feeding this our politics at the        316    00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.079    moment actually seem to be encouraging        317    00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:31.680    it and our otherwise terrific explosion        318    00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.160    of New Media outlets for information and        319    00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.600    debate are helping facilitate it I        320    00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.160    believe what we need is a new hard real        321    00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.399    world dose of shared        322    00:16:43.399 --> 00:16:46.240    experience we had one after        323    00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.079    911 and it drifted away we had one after        324    00:16:50.079 --> 00:16:53.079    Katrina and it went away we have yet to        325    00:16:53.079 --> 00:16:55.920    even have one on        326    00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.560    Iraq a show of hands please and in this        327    00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.600    room how many of you know someone        328    00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.400    personally who has served or is now        329    00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.720    serving in        330    00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.439    Iraq how many of you know a person or a        331    00:17:13.439 --> 00:17:15.439    relative of a person who has been killed        332    00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:18.919    or wounded in        333    00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.600    Iraq raise your hand if our being at war        334    00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.240    in Iraq has had any direct effect on        335    00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.400    your life at all        336    00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.000    what's        337    00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.960    left I believe for us all the issues of        338    00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.400    the war in Iraq aside how do we connect        339    00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.240    ourself ourselves and then stay        340    00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.280    connected to the other Americans who do        341    00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.360    serve in the military and elsewhere in        342    00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.919    our name on our behalf without having to        343    00:17:51.919 --> 00:17:55.159    sustain a tremendous man-made or natural        344    00:17:55.159 --> 00:17:58.559    disaster I would submit one way is in        345    00:17:58.559 --> 00:18:02.039    fact service itself service in all of        346    00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:04.600    its many forms service it can mean the        347    00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.039    Peace Corp a teacher Corp a conservation        348    00:18:07.039 --> 00:18:10.000    Corp a police Corp a hospital Aid Corp a        349

00:18:19.520    as well as the Marine Corps I do not        352    00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.720    have a specific 10 or 12 point proposal        353    00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.400    to put on the table I am a journalist        354    00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.919    not a proposal but I do have some        355    00:18:26.919 --> 00:18:29.840    framing questions for the discussion        356    00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.400    in order to be fair should it be        357    00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.039    mandatory no exemptions no permanent        358    00:18:34.039 --> 00:18:36.880    deferments everyone eventually serves        359    00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.159    should it apply across the board men and        360    00:18:39.159 --> 00:18:41.039    women all physical and intellectual        361    00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:44.440    sizes and abilities included what should        362    00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.720    be the age parameters should there be a        363    00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.320    way to involve not just the young should        364    00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.360    it be constructed around choices each        365    00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.400    individual choosing the form of service        366    00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.080    military or specific civilian he or she        367    00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.240    wishes should it be veloped in        368    00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.520    partnership with private and corporate        369    00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.559    resources as well as governmental should        370    00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:07.159    it be tied to a GI Bill type program        371    00:19:07.159 --> 00:19:09.559    service earns education home and other        372    00:19:09.559 --> 00:19:12.200    benefits in addition to the benefits of        373    00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.480    connection and of the soul I know some        374    00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.120    will argue that such a program would        375    00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.480    cost too much I would only ask compared        376    00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.679    to        377    00:19:20.679 --> 00:19:25.200    what others would argue        378    00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:36.360    others would argue that it for it to        379    00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.360    really work        380    00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.120    politically it must be voluntary I don't        381    00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.679    do politics so I will leave the politics        382    00:19:43.679 --> 00:19:46.440    of national service to someone else but        383    00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.960    voluntary service is what we have now        384    00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.720    the result to my observation at least it        385    00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.600    may be cheaper but it's also a serious        386    00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.360    causing a serious heightening of our        387    00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.039    differences and our disconnections and        388    00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:02.559    definitely not just as it involves the        389    00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:05.320    military my guess is that all of you in        390    00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.760    this room Alum students parents whatever        391    00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.559    have an interest in volunteer public        392    00:20:11.559 --> 00:20:14.159    service and that you have no doubt        393    00:20:14.159 --> 00:20:16.559    already done some of it and will always        394    00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:19.280    continue to do so am I right about that        395    00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.799    yes absolutely no question about        396    00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:26.280    it but volunteer volunteer service        397    00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.880    voluntary service the kinds that you        398    00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.720    perform and the kinds that I perform is        399    00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.080    not an equal opportunity operation        400    00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.480    non-military volunteerism is pretty well        401    00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.360    confined to the well- educated and the        402    00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.320    well off the majority of Americans are        403    00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.440    simply not in Financial in a financial        404    00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:49.000    position to delay careers to take no pay        405    00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.760    internships to take off a year or two or        406    00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.200    even a few weeks or even a long weekend        407    00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.960    to do good to help people rebuild their        408    00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.320    homes in New Orleans or Indonesia        409    00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.480    do tutoring of low-income kids in Los        410    00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.960    Angeles or De Moine find food and        411    00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.880    shelter for the devastated of darur or        412    00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.600    buxy so we have a rather Stark division        413    00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.679    Among Us the most fortunate volunteer        414    00:21:13.679 --> 00:21:14.600    for the        415    00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.919    non-military the less fortunate        416    00:21:16.919 --> 00:21:20.240    volunteer for the military and those in        417    00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.080    between the vast majority of Americans        418    00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.640    do neither because they can't afford to        419    00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.039    I know for a fact I would not not have        420    00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:31.120    voluntarily gone into the Marine Corps        421    00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.799    50 years ago I would have gone directly        422    00:21:33.799 --> 00:21:37.120    from my commencement ceremony to a job        423    00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.200    to my job that I already had as a        424    00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.679    newspaper reporter which is what I did        425    00:21:41.679 --> 00:21:44.559    three years later after my service trust        426    00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:47.840    me I was a much better reporter then        427    00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.760    because of how I spent those intervening        428    00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.360    three years and a much better person and        429    00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.679    even commencement speaker now 50 years        430    00:21:55.679 --> 00:21:58.679    later the bottom line for me on this is        431    00:21:58.679 --> 00:22:00.600    simply this whatever the ultimate        432    00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.760    conclusion I believe passionately that        433    00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.120    we would all benefit from a full and        434    00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.000    Frank discussion of our mutual        435    00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.840    responsibilities to serve of the joys        436    00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.320    and satisfactions that come from such        437    00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.919    service from lifting ourselves away from        438    00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:19.520    our own needs just for a while to pay        439    00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.799    attention to those of others and have        440    00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:25.000    trying to find a way that involves every        441    00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.320    one of us I am well aware of the        442    00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.799    collateral debates that would most        443    00:22:28.799 --> 00:22:31.120    likely spring from this one one has to        444    00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.880    do with going to war national service        445    00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.360    with a military option would complicate        446    00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.760    decisions of presidents and congresses        447    00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.120    about using Force parents and spouses        448    00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.520    and Children of the potential combatants        449    00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.000    would have to be in the loop along with        450    00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.760    the volunteer experts the pundits the        451    00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.480    politicians and the generals some would        452    00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.600    argue that's a good thing because it        453    00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.240    would force more public explanations and        454    00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.600    justifications and th harder thinking        455    00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.240    before rushing off to invade or to bomb        456    00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.200    others would say that's terrible because        457    00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.200    the result could be a hand ringing        458    00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.919    public referendum on every military use        459    00:23:11.919 --> 00:23:14.880    decision our country makes and back and        460    00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.400    forth and back and forth and so the        461    00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.919    debate would go and I say let that        462    00:23:19.919 --> 00:23:22.000    debate and all others on national        463    00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.039    service begin and as they say in other        464    00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:31.320    venues thus ends the render in of the        465    00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.400    message thank thank you very much thank        466    00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.200    you thank        467    00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.080    you but let me add very        468    00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.279    quickly I am not urging any of you        469    00:24:04.279 --> 00:24:06.000    students        470    00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.480    alums faculty members members of the        471    00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.279    administration parents to run off and        472    00:24:12.279 --> 00:24:13.919    join the        473    00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:16.600    Marines and I say that because the one        474    00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.840    of the first major commencement        475    00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:23.520    addresses I made to a college graduating        476    00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.640    class my theme then was risk take risks        477    00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.080    in your personal lives your professional        478    00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.399    lives and I went on and on about the        479    00:24:32.399 --> 00:24:35.120    joys and satisfactions to be had from a        480    00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.000    risk-filled life few weeks later phone        481    00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.039    rings at our house in Washington after        482    00:24:41.039 --> 00:24:44.919    midnight a young male voice on the phone        483    00:24:44.919 --> 00:24:49.480    says Mr Lara you changed my        484    00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.000    life I was trying to wake up he said I        485    00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.120    was in that graduating class I heard        486    00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.679    what you said about in the in your        487    00:24:57.679 --> 00:25:00.440    Commencement Address about taking        488    00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.960    risks I was in the class I had already        489    00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.919    taken a job on Wall        490    00:25:04.919 --> 00:25:07.279    Street but when you said that about        491    00:25:07.279 --> 00:25:09.440    taking risk I changed my mind and I        492    00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.520    decided to do what I wanted to do in the        493    00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.960    first place anyhow and as soon as the        494    00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.120    cem morning was over I told my mom and        495    00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.799    dad no Wall Street I was going into the        496    00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:22.960    business of making sunglasses frames        497    00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.760    with clear plastic tubes where you could        498    00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.399    change the color with a little BB like        499    00:25:28.399 --> 00:25:30.080    things you want red white and blue one        500    00:25:30.080

going to be on the CBS Morning        503    00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.279    News tomorrow demonstrating my frames I        504    00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:45.039    figured you'd want to know thank

  thinking oh my what had I        508    00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.640    wrought and of course mostly I was        509    00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.679    thinking that his parents probably had a

00:26:07.000    decide to join the Marines today pick up        513    00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.880    and go and run and go and do it fine        514    00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.039    simplify but please just don't tell me        515    00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:14.279    about        516    00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:18.000    it for the record I do now know about my        517    00:26:18.000 -->

know how your minds work I know        309    00:15:31.339 --> 00:15:32.960    what you're thinking on this day of your        310    00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.610    advancement into adulthood you're        311    00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.500    wondering to yourselves what can I        312    00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.600    expect from the outside world when I        313    00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.760    find my niche what should I know about        314    00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.430    the vast territory that lies behind the        315    00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.860    on the confines of my little subculture        316    00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.380    of textbooks ramen noodles coin-operated        317    00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.290    laundry and TV shows that seem to think        318    00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:52.850    they can skate by with random jokes        319    00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:54.380    about giant chickens that have        320    00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:55.910    absolutely nothing to do with the        321    00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.240    overall narrative        322    00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.730    the boys at South Park are absolutely        323    00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.069    correct those cutaways and flashbacks        324    00:16:03.069 --> 00:16:04.300    have nothing to do with the story        325    00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:08.649    they're just there to be funny that is a        326    00:16:08.649 --> 00:16:10.300    shallow indulgence that South Park is        327    00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:14.009    quite above and for that I salute them        328    00:16:14.009 --> 00:16:17.769    but to my point what is out there but I        329    00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:19.809    can't tell you all the correct paths to

into the tattoo        337    00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:41.679    parlor and gets an Asian symbol she        338    00:16:41.679 --> 00:16:44.079    thinks means spiritual woman but that        339    00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:45.670    she later finds out means sugar        340    00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:51.579    substitute number two don't be taken in        341    00:16:51.579 --> 00:16:53.829

  00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.850    classics as my favorite poet Henry        454    00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:25.820    Wadsworth Longfellow once said it's        455    00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:28.220    going to tempt your tummy with a taste        456    00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:31.150    of nuts and honey it's a honey of a know        457    00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.840    it's honey nut cheerios        458    00:22:35.049 --> 00:22:38.510    and if I may I would like to paraphrase        459    00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:40.820    Dickens but instead of Christmas        460    00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.279    traditions I am speaking today of        461    00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:46.250    vaginas when I say they have never put        462    00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:48.590    one scrap of gold in my pocket but they        463    00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:51.020    bring a smile to my face so therefore I        464    00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:57.799    declare them good if there is one        465

    57    00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.040    reminder of the many courageous things I        58    00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.959    had never accomplished        59    00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.599    such reminders occurred with more        60    00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.180    frequency as I came to know more of my        61    00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.680    fellow students        62    00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.080    the one who wrote a novel to raise        63    00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.299    awareness of child soldiers in the third        64    00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.440

--> 00:03:54.840    and they continued right into law school        68    00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.200    Harvard Law School alum Scott tarot        69    00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.599    famously chronicled the humiliation of        70    00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.659    being grilled mercilessly by a professor        71    00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.780    on some minute aspect of subject matter        72    00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.120    jurisdiction        73    00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.060    having lived this experience myself        74    00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.180    thanks Professor Miller        75    00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.900    I can attest to a still greater humbling        76    00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.419    few experiences strike more squarely at        77    00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.300    one's Pride than seeing someone just        78    00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.100    like you doing far more for Humanity        79    00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.460    I felt that sting while watching Kevin        80    00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.720    Jones        81    00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.160    a tireless worker        82    00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.020

the        85    00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.060    Harvard Law School students who spent        86    00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.699    their spring break investigating racial        87    00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.100    discrimination claims in the wake of        88    00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.440    Hurricane Katrina        89    00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.960    time and again my classmates        90    00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.280    contributions to humanity left me in awe        91    00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.280    the relative insignificance of my own        92    00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.919    accomplishments made it difficult for me        93    00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.820    to sleep at night        94    00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.840    today        95    00:05:12.840

that we never fully channeled        101    00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.259    its wealth of opportunities into the        102    00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:39.840    greatest possible good whatever each of        103    00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.120    us understands that to mean        104    00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.539    I speak two and four those of us who        105    00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:48.840    have failed continuously and repeatedly        106    00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.280    while students here        107    00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.620    failed        108    00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.180    to free thousands of slaves at age 19.        109    00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.940    failed to leave a legacy within the        110    00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.979    criminal justice system        111    00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.560    failed to address the plight of        112    00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.500    America's newly rediscovered poor in        113    00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.600    between visits to the Kong        114    00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.880    and failed to beat Yale in football for        115    00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.320    a fifth straight year oh wait        116    00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.819    some of us did succeed there didn't you        117    00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:32.699    but as for the rest of us I bring words        118    00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.220    of wisdom and of Hope        119    00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.419    the words are not mine        120    00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.800    but rather those of Harvard president        121    00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.660    Charles Elliott        122    00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.259    and they        123    00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.780    are already familiar to a number of you        124    00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.340    gathered here        125    00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.680    the words are inscribed on either side        126    00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.259    of Dexter gate leading out to        127    00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:03.120    Massachusetts Avenue        128    00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.960    enter to grow in wisdom and now        129    00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.400    today        130    00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.940    depart to serve better thy country and        131    00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.100    thy kind        132    00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.680    some may see in these directives the        133    00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.500    Arrogant notion that Harvard holds some        134    00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.199    Monopoly on wisdom        135    00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:25.319    still others a mere postcard industry        136    00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:28.099    Bonanza        137    00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:32.099    but I see immense hope in these words        138    00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:35.940    hope for the great mass of us not quite        139    00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.259    Heroes        140    00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:39.780    I see the possibility that we are        141    00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.699    salvageable yet        142    00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:44.880    the reassuring but daunting reality that        143    00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.539    the Point of Departure for heroism is in        144    00:07:48.539 --> 00:07:51.660    fact right now        145    00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.120    at Harvard we have grown in the        146    00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.580    knowledge of what we are capable of        147    00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.639    and thus gained the wisdom to seize        148    00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:02.759    opportunities for Valor as they come        149    00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:06.300    to embrace them to take risks for them        150    00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.639    to be courageous        151    00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:11.940    we have had occasion to glance at those        152    00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.580    around us in wide-eyed awe not because        153    00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.319    they represent the best and brightest        154    00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:17.580    Among Us        155    00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.620    but because they represent the outer        156    00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.979    limits of what we ourselves might be        157    00:08:22.979 --> 00:08:25.919    we can respond to this realization with        158    00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:29.039    either inner restlessness or willful        159    00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:30.720    apathy        160    00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.419    and despite the Cozy appeal of taking on        161    00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:36.539    Super Mario 64 once again        162    00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:38.760    most of us will choose to engage the        163    00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.260    former        164    00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.820    depart        165    00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.399    the instruction on that gate is both        166    00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:47.339    forgiving and frightening        167    00:08:47.339 --> 00:08:49.019    more than anything        168    00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:54.080    today it is incredibly exciting        169    00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:59.399    a a celebration of accomplishment        170    00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:01.500    after all        171    00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.540    they were going to give these degrees to        172    00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.720    somebody        173    00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.500    all right        174    00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.360    even the Magnus        175    00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.080    let us instead celebrate insomnia and        176    00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.600    the potential it represents let us        177    00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.880    celebrate those who have humbled us with        178    00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.580    their service and their excellence and        179    00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.760    celebrate the hope that we too May one        180    00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.860    day sleep slightly better        181    00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.220    knowing at least that we did not fail to        182    00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.720    try        183    00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.420    congratulations to you all

when I was a student at the        15    00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.320    college some years ago a number of my        16    00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.280    colleagues began mistaking me for        17    00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.479    another member of the Freshman        18    00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.759    Class like me        19    00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.280    Gerald Williams known to

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.400    constant reminder of the many courageous        42    00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.040    things I had never        43    00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.760    accomplished such reminders occurred        44    00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.120    with more frequency as I came to know        45    00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.959    more of my fellow students the one who        46    00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.400    wrote a novel to raise awareness of        47    00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.360    child soldiers in the third world the        48    00:03:04.360 -->

still greater        58    00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.319    humbling few experiences strike more        59    00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.080    squarely at one's Pride than seeing        60

left me in        73    00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.639    awe the relative insignificance of my        74    00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.160    own accomplishments made it difficult        75    00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.280    for me to sleep at        76    00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.720    night today        77    00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.479    I speak two and I speak four the silent

00:04:50.479    leave this great institution knowing        81    00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.759    that we never fully channeled its wealth        82    00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.320    of opportunities into the greatest        83    00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.880    possible good whatever each of us        84    00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.320    understands that to mean I speak to and        85    00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.639    for those of us who have failed        86    00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.240    continuously and repeatedly while        87    00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.800    students        88    00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.960    here failed to free thousands of slaves        89    00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.000    at age        90    00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.479    19

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.120    you but as for the rest of us I bring        99    00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.319    words of wisdom and of Hope the words        100    00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.759    are not        101    00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.240    mine but rather those of Harvard        102    00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.680    president Charles Elliott and        103    00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.920    [Applause]        104    00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.720    they and they are already familiar to a        105    00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.560    number of you gathered here the words        106    00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.919    are inscribed on either side of Dexter        107    00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.960    gate leading out to Massachusetts Avenue        108    00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.319    enter to grow in wisdom and now        109    00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:29.360    today depart to serve better thy Country        110    00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.880    and th        111    00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.960    kind some may see in these directives        112    00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.800    the Arrogant notion that Harvard holds        113    00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.840    some Monopoly on        114    00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.400    wisdom still others a mere postcard        115    00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.960    industry        116    00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.440    Bonanza but I see immense hope in these        117    00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.319    words hope for the great mass of us not        118    00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:57.000    quite Heroes I see the possibility that        119    00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.479    we are salvageable yet the reassuring        120    00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:03.120    but daunting reality that the Point of        121    00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.479    Departure for heroism is in fact right        122    00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:11.599    now at Harvard we have grown in the        123    00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:14.639    knowledge of what we are capable of and        124    00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:17.319    thus gained the wisdom to seize        125    00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:20.800    opportunities for Valor as they come to        126    00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.240    embrace them to take risks for them to        127    00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.479    be        128    00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:28.280    courageous we have had occasion to        129    00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.919    glance at those around us in wide-eyed        130    00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:33.319    awe not because they represent the best        131    00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:36.160    and brightest among us but because they        132    00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.520    represent the outer limits of what we        133    00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.680    ourselves might be we can respond to        134    00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.000    this realization with either inner        135    00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.639    restlessness or willful        136    00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:50.639    apathy and despite the Cozy appeal of        137    00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:54.680    taking on Super Mario 64 once again most        138    00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.120    of us will choose to engage the        139    00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.680    former depart        140    00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.280    the instruction on that gate is both        141    00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.199    forgiving and        142    00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:08.159    frightening more than anything today it        143    00:08:08.159 --> 00:08:10.440    is incredibly        144    00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.520    exciting let us not consider today a        145    00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.319    celebration of        146    00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:18.360    accomplishment after        147    00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.520    all they were going to give these        148    00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.120    degrees to somebody        149    00:08:37.959 --> 00:08:40.399    even the        150    00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.480    magnas let us instead celebrate        151    00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.800    insomnia and the potential it represents        152    00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.040    let us celebrate those who have humbled        153    00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.000    us with their service and their        154    00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.800    excellence and celebrate the hope that        155    00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.680    we too May one day sleep slightly better        156    00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.000    knowing at least        157    00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.600    that we did not fail to        158    00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.800    try

00:00:33.760    thanks for coming in        7    00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.960    seriously the past four years        8    00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.320    have given us wings taught us so much        9    00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.520    about the world about life        10    00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.320    about ourselves the knowledge that we        11    00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.120    have taken        12    00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.520    from these hallowed halls will act as a        13    00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.239    beacon        14    00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.920    for our generation's progress towards        15    00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.600    the horizon        16    00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.760    we are the future we are the leaders        17    00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.719    but there is a secret pain behind all of        18    00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.760    this that no one dares discuss        19    00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.760    a force that leaves pillows stained with        20    00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.840    tears and relationships forever        21    00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.760    shattered        22    00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.280    we're all staring it in the face but        23    00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.960    pretending like we can't see it well i        24    00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.080    will not shy away from it        25    00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.960    it's true after four years of office        26    00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.520    hours        27    00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.560    and sections and response

make small talk        31    00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.680    you know what's happened you're at home        32    00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.680    with a bunch of friends        33    00:01:35.680

ordered a sentence like this slips out        39    00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.200    of your mouth        40    00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.799    hey do you guys ever notice how the        41    00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.240    drive-through window is kind of modeled        42    00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.840    on foucault's panopticon        43    00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.600    that's the sound of the train of fun        44    00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.399    coming to a halt        45    00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.280    no no one ever thought that        46    00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.920    but you did how embarrassing        47    00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.520    you sink into the corner of the car        48    00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.440    cursing that one day you actually went        49    00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.160    to moral reasoning and learned something        50    00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.400    you know what's happened to you ever        51    00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.160    been ostracized at a fourth of july        52    00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.760    picnic because your clever quip about        53    00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.680    the missouri compromise didn't quite fit        54    00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.200    in with the beach volleyball and igloo        55    00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.480    coolers        56    00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.920    ever find out that discussing the        57    00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.680    anthropological politics of national        58    00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.360    geographic magazine is in fact        59    00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.640    not what your nine-year-old cousin        60    00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.160    wanted to discuss while watching dora

four of        132    00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.680    family guy on dvd instead of doing a        133    00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.840    problem set        134    00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.280    picking up us weekly instead of        135    00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.680    scientific america every once in a while        136    00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.520    peppering conversations with meaningless        137    00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.720    references to everybody loves raymond        138    00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.880    but like eating the food at the kong it        139    00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.720    only feels good until that sickening        140    00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.080    feeling sets in in your stomach        141    00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.800    so must we continually force feed        142    00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.360    ourselves the crab rangoon of the masses        143    00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.479    in order to        144    00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.800    not be those condescending harvard alums        145    00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.800    that we encounter on a daily basis        146    00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.680

sense to anyone        154    00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.919    outside of harvard so my black maiden        155    00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.199    decided to go up to the quad because        156

00:08:45.920    dialectical idiosyncrasy        219    00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.240    ending sentences with prepositions        220    00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.279    that's where i'm at        221    00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:55.040    you see we don't have to fear the        222    00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.440    transition to the real world it's simple        223    00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.279    now am i saying we should lower        224    00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:01.040    ourselves no        225    00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.959    i'm saying that you can't lead a world        226    00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.480    that can't relate to you        227    00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.480    that relating on a human level is more        228    00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.920    important than name dropping on an        229    00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.600    intellectual one that we should strive        230    00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.320    to always be        231    00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.360    humans first and havardians second        232    00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.839    so don't abandon your semicolons your        233    00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:18.080    string theories and your microeconomics        234    00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.680    guard them forever        235    00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.600    cherish this time we've had together in        236    00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.800    this bizarre        237    00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.120    and at times frighteningly intellectual        238    00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.920    microcosm of free discourse        239    00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.120    and wait because decades from now        240    00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.200    we'll all be back here well actually        241    00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.640    we'll probably be in alston        242    00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.680    but it's okay yes we'll all be back here        243    00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.839    sipping champagne in the banquet room at        244    00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:42.080    the lawrence summers center for gender        245    00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.480    research        246    00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.000    it's going to be sweet and we'll all be        247    00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.920    able to once again talk freely        248    00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.959    without fear about our good friend max        249    00:09:56.959 --> 00:09:57.839    weber        250    00:09:57.839 --> 00:10:01.440    thank you everyone happy graduation of        251

   00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.520    thanks lorena        2    00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.400    it is an honor to speak on behalf of the        3    00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.320    most extraordinary collection of        4    00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.240    financial debt assembled since the        5    00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.200    reagan era        6    00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.800    the harvard medical and dental class of        7    00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.800    2005.        8    00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.000    by some estimates the amount that my        9    00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.080    class owes the federal government        10    00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.840    is about the same as what the federal        11    00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.960    government owes the european union        12    00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.040    so in the spirit of patriotism i'd like        13    00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.520    to propose that the united states deploy        14    00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.559    the harvard class        15    00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.079    of 2005 to ibiza and the riviera and        16    00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.840    we'll all just call it even        17    00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.480    on this day you will be tempted to offer        18    00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.920    us congratulations        19    00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.760    but the fact that we will be walking        20    00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.480    across this stage testifies to one truth        21    00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.800    and one truth only that none of us        22    00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.480    graduating today        23    00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.440    possessed the dedication the creativity        24    00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.439    the persistence or the strength of        25    00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:06.320    character        26    00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.240    it would have taken to flunk out of        27    00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.520    harvard once they let        28    00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.920    us in after four years of study i have        29    00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.520    learned the following        30    00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.200    i have learned that the majority of        31    00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.360    adolescents in pediatrics clinic        32    00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.360    have more active sex lives than i do        33    00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.159    i have learned that surgeons might not        34    00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.520    know what an organ does        35    00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.680    but they aren't afraid to cut it out        36    00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.159    i've learned that powerpoint is the most        37    00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.560    efficient way to make a presentation        38    00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.240    because it saved our professors the        39    00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.000    trouble of thinking about their own        40    00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.159    lectures and us the trouble of        41    00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.079    remembering them        42    00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:45.600    i have learned that we will struggle for        43    00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.920    years to attain a white coat        44    00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.560    that's just as long as what the guy from        45    00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.600    food service        46    00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.600    receives immediately        47    00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.360    and i have learned that there is no        48    00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.119    situation in the hospital        49    00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.600    so tragically hopeless that a harvard        50    00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.920    medical student can't make it even worse        51    00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.360    you probably think that you're here        52    00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.920    today to celebrate us but we think        53    00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.319    we're actually here to celebrate you the        54    00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.239    family and faculty who got us to        55    00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.840    graduation        56    00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.680    my parents brother and sister are here        57    00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.840    from chicago which my harvard professors        58    00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.760    tell me is a small city located        59    00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.640    somewhere in california        60    00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.560    my father's an internist who still loves        61    00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.560    going to the office after more than 40        62    00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.599    years in practice        63    00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.280    like many of the physician parents in        64    00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.920    the audience dad was mildly horrified        65    00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.680    that his child decided to go to medical        66    00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.840    school in the current healthcare climate        67    00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.840    but he and my mother the best teacher i        68    00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.080    know have always supported our right to        69    00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.480    make        70    00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.959    our own mistakes and since they'll be        71    00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.720    watching this on video i want to say the        72    00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.480    following to my grandparents        73    00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.080    if you'd had one quarter of the        74    00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.840    opportunities that you and my parents        75    00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.120    struggled to give me        76    00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.040    you'd have been standing on the stage 60        77    00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.720    years ago        78    00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.319    so i'd like to take this chance to thank        79    00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.000    my family        80    00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.760    and all the families here who worked so        81    00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.519    hard to give us the choices that we've        82    00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.480    had        83    00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.480    and for those of you who are able to pay        84    00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.400    your child's tuition outright        85    00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.239    i hope that you feel good about having        86    00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.159    purchased an education        87    00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:33.840    instead of say the cayman islands        88    00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.760    great teaching often occurs while nobody        89    00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.599    is watching with no expectation of        90    00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.120    recognition or reward        91    00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.879    which is precisely why i'd like to        92    00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.480    mention a few of the faculty who were        93    00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.879    tremendously kind to me        94    00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.959    so academy award style let me briefly        95    00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:53.920    thank the following        96    00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.560    my surgical mentors dr soy bell dr        97    00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.480    bladey and dr hoda        98    00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.200    dean oriol dr goril dr struller dr        99    00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.760    safeter        100    00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.400    and dr cindy mcdermott i'd also like to        101    00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.080    thank the brigham surgeon in chief        102    00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.959    dr zinner who made time to meet with us        103    00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:09.680    every week        104    00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.159    when we were third years and dr charles        105    00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:12.799    mccabe        106    00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.040    a surgeon who trained one third of my        107    00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.120    class and probably one half        108    00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.519    of the residents in the audience today        109    00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.959    i'm particularly delighted        110    00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.400    i'm particularly delighted that our        111    00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.040    graduation speaker is dr atul gawande        112    00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.360    who in addition to being a busy surgeon        113    00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.800    and an elegant writer        114    00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.880    found time to encourage me to pursue my        115    00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.720    interests in surgery and international        116    00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.840    medicine        117    00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.280    we're aware that our mentors could have        118    00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.199    been spending more time with their        119    00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.880    patients their families or their        120    00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.440    research        121    00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.520    instead they chose to spend some of it        122    00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.000    with us we are profoundly grateful        123    00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.600    and we promise not to tell their        124    00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.000    department chairs        125    00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.280    perhaps the most extraordinary        126    00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.120    contribution to our education however        127    00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.080    came from the thousands        128    00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.800    of patients who asked us to learn from        129    00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.120    them        130    00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.759    so we could someday treat others on this        131    00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.520    day i think of the elderly female        132    00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.360    patient who once told me        133    00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.840    you remind me of my husband you don't        134    00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.520    look anything like him though        135    00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.120    he was a very handsome man        136    00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.240    i'd like to conclude with the final        137    00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.960    lessons i've learned        138    00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.440    i've learned from classmates like kadar        139    00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.440    noop mary catherine and laura        140    00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.280    whose work in clinics around the globe        141    00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.960    inspired my interest in international        142    00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.759    medicine        143    00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.600    the simple proposition that our        144    00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.960    neighbors in the world        145    00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.680    should be treated like neighbors because        146    00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.960    of their contributions        147    00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.759    patients in haiti guatemala africa and        148    00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:40.479    asia        149    00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.039    know that our country has far far more        150    00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:44.240    to offer the world        151    00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:53.840    than guns pharmaceuticals and arrogance        152    00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:56.800    and i have learned that we might never        153    00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.639    match the intellectual accomplishments        154    00:05:58.639 --> 00:05:59.919    of our professors        155    00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.919    but if we rigorously abstain from        156    00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.280    exercise we might        157    00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.840    someday hope to match their physiques        158    00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.199    but the most valuable lesson is the one        159    00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:12.560    learned by my roommate        160    00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.039    who watched an anesthesiologist save        161    00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.880    someone's life during a code        162    00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.600    by injecting just the right medication        163    00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.000    into        164    00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.319    a patient he thought was the patient        165    00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:24.639    next door        166    00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.319    you can read about the since then in dr        167    00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.919    grande's upcoming book        168    00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:32.000    your hospital is trying to kill you        169    00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.000    the lesson is simple in medicine as in        170    00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.400    life        171    00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.960    it's far more important to be lucky than        172    00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.400    to be good        173    00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.080    my friends and classmates we've spent        174    00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.319    the last four five or        175    00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:47.280    in some cases 37 difficult years of our        176    00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.240    lives        177    00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.199    studying to get good and not one of us        178    00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.360    graduating today can effectively treat        179    00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.000    lower back pain        180    00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.599    so as we move forward into our        181    00:06:57.599 --> 00:06:59.599    residencies let us resolve        182    00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:02.800    to take the focus off getting good and        183    00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.680    concentrate        184    00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.160    instead on getting lucky thank you so        185    00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.560    much

this Harvard        38    00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.430    Square is extremely unique nowhere else        39    00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.500    in the world will you find a man wearing        40    00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.959    a turban and a Red Sox jacket working in        41    00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.549    a lesbian bookstore I'm just glad my        42    00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:02.870    dad's working now personal choice it's        43    00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.250    particularly sweet for me to be here        44    00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.859    today because this is true when I        45    00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.500    graduated I wanted very badly to be a        46    00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.290    class day speaker        47    00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.090    unfortunately my speech was rejected so        48    00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.500    if you'll indulge me I'd like to read a        49    00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.480    portion of that speech this is the        50    00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.680    actual speech from 15 years ago        51    00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.930    fellow students as we sit here today        52    00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.599    listening to that classic AHA tune which        53    00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.780    will definitely stand the test of time I        54    00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.859    would like to make several predictions        55    00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.220    about what the future will hold I        56    00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.750    believe that one day a simple governor        57    00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.000    from a small southern state will rise to        58    00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.690    the highest office in the land        59    00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.490    he will lacked political skill but will        60    00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.410    lead on the sheer strength of his moral        61    00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.050    authority I believe that justice will        62    00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.750    prevail and one day the Berlin Wall will        63    00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.700    crumble        64    00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.470    uniting East and West Berlin forever        65    00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.360    under communist rule I believe that one        66    00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.010    day a high-speed network of        67    00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.810    interconnected computers will spring up        68    00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.300    worldwide so enriching people that they        69    00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.100    will lose their interest in idle        70    00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:26.420    chitchat and pornography and finally I        71    00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.530    believe that one day I will have a        72    00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.900    television show on a major Network seen        73    00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.210    by millions of people a night which I        74    00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.220    will use to reenact crimes and help        75    00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.730    catch at large criminals and I had a        76    00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.990    section on the death of Wall Street we        77    00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.540    don't need to hear about that the point        78    00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.070    is that although you see me as a        79    00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.730    celebrity a member of the cultural elite        80    00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.760    demigod if you will potential husband        81    00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.550    material maybe the father of your child        82    00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.620    improve it baby I came here        83    00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.800    I came here in the fall of 1981 and I        84    00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.350    lived here at home worthy actually I'm a        85    00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.040    student much like you that's just sad        86    00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.580    I was without exaggeration this is true        87    00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.770    the ugliest picture in the freshman        88    00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.320    Facebook when Harvard asked me for a        89    00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.639    picture the previous summer this is a        90    00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.260    true story I actually I thought it was        91    00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.810    for their records so I literally just        92    00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.460    liked their private records like in a        93    00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.400    file so I jogged in the August heat to a        94    00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.320    passport photo office and sat for a        95    00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.720    morgue shot now this is that what        96    00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.220    happened to make matters worse when the        97    00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.840    Facebook came out they put my picture        98    00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.260    right next to Catherine Oxenberg a        99    00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.240    stunning blonde actress true story who        100    00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.070    was accepted to the class of 85 but        101    00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.530    decided to defer admission so she could        102    00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.699    join the cast of dynasty folks my photo        103    00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.320    would have looked bad on any page but        104    00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.090    next to Catherine Oxenberg I looked like        105    00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.500    a mackerel that had been in a car        106    00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:01.039    accident you see in those days I was six        107    00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:03.320    feet four inches tall and I weighed 150        108    00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.990    pounds true recently I had some        109    00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.550    structural engineers run those numbers        110    00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.289    into a computer model and according to        111    00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:12.380    the computer I collapsed in 1987 killing        112    00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.940    hundreds in Taiwan after freshman year I        113    00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.169    I moved to Mather house yeah now their        114    00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:22.460    house very popular yeah matter house        115    00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.930    incidentally was designed by the same        116    00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.400    firm that built Hitler's bunker        117    00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:30.370    in fact if Hitler had conducted the war        118    00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.020    from Mather house he'd have shot himself        119    00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:38.310    a year earlier saved us a lot of trouble        120    00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:40.840    it's all the woohoo people from Mather        121    00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:51.430    house were a little bum now 1985 seems        122    00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.529    like a long time ago now when I had my        123    00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:55.719    class day you students would have been 7        124    00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:59.710    years old 7 years old you realize what        125    00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.050    that means back then I could have beaten        126    00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.379    any of you in a fight and I mean really        127    00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:09.879    badly like no contest at all if anyone        128    00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:11.469    here was a time machine seriously I will        129    00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:13.000    kick your seven-year-old butt right now        130    00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.870    a lot has happened in 15 years though        131    00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.339    when you think about it we come from        132    00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:20.710    completely different worlds when I        133    00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.110    graduated in 1985 we watched movies        134    00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.300    starring Tom Cruise and listened to        135    00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.419    music by Madonna I come from a time when        136    00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:29.949    we huddled around our TV sets and        137    00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:32.710    watched The Cosby Show on NBC never        138    00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.150    imagining that there would one day be a        139    00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.319    show called Cosby on CBS in 1985 we        140    00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:40.569    drove cars with driver's side airbags        141    00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:42.279    but if you told us that one day they'd        142    00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:44.289    be passenger side airbags would have        143    00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:47.310    burned you for witchcraft        144    00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.259    of course I think there is some common        145    00:07:50.259 --> 00:07:51.849    ground between us I remember well the        146    00:07:51.849 --> 00:07:54.219    great uncertainty of this day the        147    00:07:54.219 --> 00:07:57.069    anxiety many of you were justifiably        148    00:07:57.069 --> 00:07:58.960    nervous about leaving the safe        149    00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.000    comfortable world of Harvard Yard and        150    00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.279    hurling yourself headlong into the cold        151    00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:05.500    harsh world of Harvard grad school a        152    00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.259    plum job at your father's firm or a year        153    00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:10.270    abroad with

175    00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.800    Association is at the Mount Auburn        176    00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.990    cemetery shaking down the corpse of        177    00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.899    Henry Adams they heard he has a brass        178    00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:13.020    toe ring and they aims to get it now        179    00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.149    imagine no

00:09:32.130    rings usually after a big meal when        185    00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.649    you're sort of tired and most vulnerable        186    00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:36.990    and a voice asks you for money now        187    00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.400    knowing you've read in the paper that        188    00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.550    they just raised 2.5 billion dollars you        189    00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.820    ask what do you need it for then there's        190    00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.550    a long pause and the voice on the other        191    00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.360    end of line says we don't need it we        192    00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.959    just want it        193    00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:58.090    [Laughter]        194    00:10:03.410

00:13:44.150    filled out a questionnaire and I made        278    00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.340    damn sure that they knew I had been to        279    00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.080    Harvard that I had written this thesis        280    00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.830    and I expected the very best treatment        281    00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.570    and so the next day I was sent to the        282    00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.790    Santa Monica branch of Wilson's house of        283    00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:59.960    suede and leather now when you have a        284    00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.930    Harvard degree and you're working at        285    00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:05.120    Wilson's house of suede and leather you        286    00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.220    are haunted by the ghostly images of        287    00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.080    your classmates who sue shows graduate        288    00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.910    school you see their faces everywhere in        289    00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.080    coffee cups you see them in fish tanks        290    00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.460    you think you're going crazy and they're        291    00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.320    always laughing at you as you stack        292    00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.330    suede shirts no man in good conscience        293    00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.120    whatever where I tried a lot of things        294    00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.100    during this period acting in corporate        295    00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.020    infomercials serving drinks in a        296    00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.480    non-equity theater I even took a job        297    00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.860    entertaining at a seven year old's        298    00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.410    birthday party in desperate need of work        299    00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:31.910    I put together some sketches and scored        300    00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.190    a job at the fledgling Fox Network as a        301    00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.570    writer and performer for a brand new        302    00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.960    show called the Wilton North Report I        303    00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.070    was finally on a network and really        304    00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.440    excited the producer told me the show        305    00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.090    was going to revolutionize television        306    00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:47.570    and in a way it did the show was so        307    00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.050    hated and did so badly        308    00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.310    when four weeks later news of its        309    00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:52.690    cancellation was announced to the Fox        310    00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:54.670    affiliates they burst into spontaneous        311    00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:57.550    applause that had never happened before        312    00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.980    in television eventually though I got a        313    00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.570    big break I had submitted along with my        314    00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.700    writing partner a batch of sketches to        315    00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.470    Saturday Night Live and after a year and        316    00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.750    a half they read it and they gave us a        317    00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.269    two-week tryout the two weeks turned        318    00:15:10.269 --> 00:15:12.430    into two seasons and I felt hey this is        319    00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.800    success I'm successful now successful        320    00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.240    enough to write a TV pilot for an        321    00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.760    original sitcom and when the network        322    00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.820    decided to make it feeling good I leave        323    00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.680    Saturday Night Live time to go to hell        324    00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.899    now this this TV show was gonna be        325    00:15:25.899 --> 00:15:27.279    groundbreaking this new one it was gonna        326    00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:29.529    resurrect the career of TV's Batman Adam        327    00:15:29.529 --> 00:15:31.899    West it was gonna be a comedy without a        328    00:15:31.899 --> 00:15:34.329    laugh track or a studio audience it was        329    00:15:34.329 --> 00:15:37.329    gonna change all the rules and here's        330    00:15:37.329 --> 00:15:39.880    what happened when the pilot aired it        331    00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.399    was the second lowest rated television        332    00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:46.089    show of all time it's actually tied with        333    00:15:46.089 --> 00:15:49.560    a test pattern they show in Nova Scotia        334    00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:55.240    so I was 28 once again no job I had good        335    00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.500    writing credits in New York but I was        336    00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.300    filled with disappointment and I had no        337    00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.579    idea what I was going to do next I        338    00:16:00.579 --> 00:16:03.899    started smelling suede on my fingertips        339    00:16:03.899 --> 00:16:06.459    and that is when the Simpsons saved my        340    00:16:06.459 --> 00:16:08.950    life I got a job there I started writing        341    00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:10.480    episodes about Springfield getting a        342    00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.339    monorail or home or going to college I        343    00:16:12.339 --> 00:16:14.140    was finally putting my Harvard education        344    00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.720    to good use writing dialogue for a man        345    00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.520    who's so stupid that in one episode he        346    00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.720    forgot to make his own heartbeat life        347    00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.610    was good and then an insane inexplicable        348    00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:30.010    opportunity came my way a chance to        349    00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:32.079    audition for host of the new late-night        350    00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:34.480    show I took the opportunity very        351    00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.860    seriously but at the time I have to be        352    00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.110    honest I had the relaxed confidence of        353    00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.890    someone who knew he had no real shot so        354    00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.870    I couldn't fear losing a great job that        355    00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.269    I had never had that I couldn't hope to        356    00:16:46.269 --> 00:16:48.730    have and I think that actually that that        357    00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.519    attitude made the difference I will        358    00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:53.589    never forget being in the Simpsons        359    00:16:53.589 --> 00:16:55.779    recording basement that morning when the        360    00:16:55.779 --> 00:16:59.709    phone rang it was for me my car was        361    00:16:59.709 --> 00:17:01.400    blocking a fire lane        362    00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.360    but a week later I got another call I        363    00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.689    got the job so this finally was        364    00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:12.439    undeniably it the truly life-altering        365    00:17:12.439 --> 00:17:15.050    break that I had always dreamed of and I        366    00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.660    went to work I gathered all my funny        367    00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.850    friends and poured all my years of        368    00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:21.199    common experience into building the show        369    00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:23.300    over the summer I gathered the talent        370    00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.420    figured out the sensibility found max        371    00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:29.600    found Andy found my people we debuted on        372    00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.360    September 13th 1993 and I was really        373    00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.790    happy really happy with our effort I        374    00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.790    felt like I had seized the moment that I        375    00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:40.480    had put my very best foot forward and        376    00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.760    this is what the most respected and        377    00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.429    widely read television critic Tom Shales        378    00:17:46.429 --> 00:17:49.070    wrote in The Washington Post is actually        379    00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:52.610    quote O'Brien is a living collage of        380    00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:57.110    annoying nervous habits he giggles and        381    00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.820    titters jiggles about and fiddles with        382    00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.820    his cuffs he has dark beady little eyes        383    00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.970    like a rabbit he's one of the whitest        384    00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:07.840    white men ever        385    00:18:13.389 --> 00:18:15.739    O'Brien is a switch on the guests who        386    00:18:15.739 --> 00:18:17.210    won't leave he's the host who should        387    00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.090    never have come let the Late Show with        388    00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:22.279    Conan O'Brien become the Late Late Show        389    00:18:22.279 --> 00:18:24.739    and may the hosts return to Conan        390    00:18:24.739 --> 00:18:26.779    oblivion whence he came        391    00:18:26.779 --> 00:18:30.559    end quote there's more but it gets kind        392    00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:38.179    of mean needless to say I took a lot of        393    00:18:38.179 --> 00:18:41.179    criticism some of it deserved some of it        394    00:18:41.179 --> 00:18:44.509    excessive and I'll be honest with you it        395    00:18:44.509 --> 00:18:48.080    hurt like you would not believe but I'm        396    00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.690    telling you all this for a reason I have        397    00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.330    had a lot of success I have had a lot of        398    00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.570    failure I've looked good and I've looked        399    00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:57.259    bad        400    00:18:57.259 --> 00:18:59.840    I've been praised and I've been        401    00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.450    criticized but my mistakes have been        402    00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.690    necessary except for Wilson's houses        403    00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:11.889    waiting that was stupid don't do that        404    00:19:11.889 --> 00:19:14.210    I've dwelled on my failures today        405    00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:15.619    because as graduates of Harvard your        406    00:19:15.619 --> 00:19:17.570    biggest liability is your need to        407    00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:19.940    succeed you need to always find yourself        408    00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.269    on the sweet side of the bell curve        409    00:19:22.269 --> 00:19:24.499    because success is a lot like a bright        410    00:19:24.499 --> 00:19:27.289    white tuxedo you feel terrific when you        411    00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:28.789    get it but then you're desperately        412    00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:30.710    afraid of getting it dirty of spoiling        413    00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.409    it in any way I left the cocoon of        414    00:19:33.409 --> 00:19:35.359    Harvard I left the cocoon of Saturday        415    00:19:35.359 --> 00:19:36.080    Night Live        416    00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.059    I left the cocoon of The Simpsons and        417    00:19:38.059 --> 00:19:41.659    each time it was bruising and tumultuous        418    00:19:41.659 --> 00:19:44.629    and yet every failure was freeing and        419    00:19:44.629 --> 00:19:47.599    I'll be honest with you today I'm as        420    00:19:47.599 --> 00:19:50.090    nostalgic for the bad as I am for the        421    00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.820    good so that's what I wish for all of        422    00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:57.169    you the bad as well as the

She lived an extraordinary life and the world lost a truly incredible person today.     Her friends and family were everything to her, and we want to say goodbye to all of you on her behalf.  To quote Brooke herself, ""My friends and family have made my life and all of the events in it either more bearable when they were difficult or more beautiful when they were not.

13    00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.910    Harvard four years ago I arrived with my        14    00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.500    parents like most other freshmen unlike        15    00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.220    everyone else though my father left but        16    00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.370    my brother didn't the name tag at the        17    00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.330    door to 12 their Hall said Brooke and        18    00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.490    Jean Allison now the initial reaction to        19    00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.950    this situation was usually one of        20    00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.509    confusion or some degree of disbelief I        21    00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.070    think the idea of going away to college        22    00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.560    with your mother is a concept not        23    00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.899    readily embraced by most college        24    00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:28.539    freshmen a mother's presence albeit        25    00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.720    nurturing can create a whole host of        26    00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.619    social problems for those seeking more        27    00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.940    than just academic enrichment my mother        28    00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.030    has been with me every hour of every day        29    00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.869    and has attended all of my classes from        30    00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.929    freshman Expos to senior thesis        31    00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.479    I am a matriculated student my mother is        32    00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.640    not I will get a diploma my mother will        33    00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.660    not has she been any less enriched than        34    00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.819    I have because of these two facts        35    00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.700    absolutely not        36    00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.700    when we first got here from New York        37    00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.569    neither one of us knew what to expect I        38    00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.860    was 17 and my mother was 44 and it was        39    00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.019    the first time away of college for both        40    00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.519    of us and we were frightened we wondered        41    00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.040    whether we would fit into the Harvard        42    00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.690    community somehow criss-crossing Harvard        43    00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.080    Yard in my wheelchair with my mother        44    00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.150    running behind me with my books and        45    00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.269    other paraphernalia didn't quite create        46    00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.640    an image of my blending into the Harvard        47    00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.510    landscape there are times when I thought        48    00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.579    for sure that the statue of John Harvard        49    00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.989    was looking right at us and saying what        50    00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.239    in heaven's name are you doing here but        51    00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.720    as time went by we came to understand        52    00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.090    that John Harvard was from a different        53    00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.790    time and we realized that our        54    00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.709    conspicuousness was not such a bad thing        55    00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.600    through the personal relationships we        56    00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.510    formed we realized that some people's        57    00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.329    differences were just more subtle than        58    00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.549    others        59    00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.959    we were very visible affirmation Harvard        60    00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.290    was a diversified community where all        61    00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.859    people had been accepted no matter what        62    00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:52.870    they looked like        63    00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.780    what they believed in or whom they chose        64    00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.280    to go to bed with the striking irony        65    00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.100    about this observation was that through        66    00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.519    the recognition of our differences came        67    00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.220    the realization that were all really the        68    00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.989    same the basic need and desire to love        69    00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.229    and to be loved        70    00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.040    exists in all of us the beauty of the        71    00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.400    Harvard experience lies in the        72    00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.040    relationships we formed here we're all        73    00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.919    about to receive our diplomas which        74    00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.880    represent many years of hard work        75    00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.660    however I dare say that once the diploma        76    00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.710    has been matted framed and put on the        77    00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.520    wall the memories it will evoke will not        78    00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.820    be of what it took to get it you'll        79    00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.470    think of the yard and the quad you        80    00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.720    reminisce about Harvard Square and the        81    00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.960    houses in which you lived you'll think        82    00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.050    of the Science Center Sanders Theatre        83    00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.470    and coffee a looker but most importantly        84    00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.650    we'll think of the people the people        85    00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.910    with whom you share these places the        86    00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.380    memories that I have my mother has the        87    00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.139    relationships I've made my mother has        88    00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:32.900    made from the professors and students to        89    00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.830    the bus drivers and cafeteria staff our        90    00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.470    lives have been enriched by all of the        91    00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.630    people we've met I would not be here        92    00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.900    forward for my mother and she wouldn't        93    00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.830    be here for we're not for me and so it        94    00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.669    goes as much as we would like to take        95    00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.120    credit for own accomplishments none of        96    00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.729    us would be here had not been for the        97    00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:04.460    efforts and caring of those who have        98    00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.570    helped us along the way        99    00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.100    our mutual dependence is so often        100    00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:18.110    misdiagnosed as self-reliance whether it        101    00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.280    was a parent or sibling a friend or        102    00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.270    teacher or just someone who was able to        103    00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.870    say the        104    00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.980    right thing at the right time none of us        105    00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.440    has escaped the love and caring of        106    00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.420    others both my mother and I have learned        107    00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.350    so much from all of you what we hope you        108    00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.550    can learn from us        109    00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.600    and from each other is to take no one in        110    00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.780    your life for granted and delight in the        111    00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.890    moments you spend together time is so        112    00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.240    brief and so precious and not one of us        113    00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.980    knows how life will unfold ten years ago        114    00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.100    when I was 11 years old I was hit by a        115    00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.940    car        116    00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.690    I was initially thought to be brain dead        117    00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.340    and no one expected me to live        118

as we the        16    00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.900    Harvard class of 1999 stand proudly with        17    00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.800    this university at another separating of        18    00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.729    the centuries indeed this is a moment of        19    00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.259    fond memories and proud achievements but        20    00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.790    this is also a moment of great        21    00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.540    anticipation and great hope as most of        22    00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.000    us will move on to new responsibilities        23    00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.880    and others will continue with the        24    00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.810    progress of broadening this great        25    00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.560    university to the world as a mid-career        26    00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.110    student at the John F Kennedy School of        27    00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.260    Government        28    00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.260    when I look back as we move forward I        29    00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.620    have seen in this one year pivotal        30    00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.940    events that have defied history and set        31    00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.410    an important course for all of us last        32    00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.000    fall in a glorious convocation the world        33    00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.290    watched as the legendary Nelson Mandela        34    00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.280    president of the Republic of South        35    00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.400    Africa received an honorary Doctorate        36    00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.960    degree from Harvard University        37    00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.200    on that same euphoric occasion was        38    00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.150    announced the historic Mandela fellows        39    00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.270    program for South African scholars to        40    00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.070    spend sabbaticals here at the Du Bois        41    00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.240    Institute mapping a smoother transition        42    00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.750    to a multiracial democracy and then in        43    00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.750    December our flags flew at half-mast as        44    00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.730    the Harvard community mourned together        45    00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.170    the sad but heroic homegoing of civil        46    00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.320    rights giant and beloved educator judge        47    00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.890    a Leon Higginbotham and Harvard has        48    00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.560    honored his extraordinary legacy with a        49    00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.710    fellowship at the Kennedy School and        50    00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.480    lectures at the Du Bois Institute and        51    00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.310    the School of Law in February we saw the        52    00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.290    birth of the Harvard student chapter of        53    00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.580    the n-double a-c-p a feat that Judge        54    00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.880    Higginbotham helped to accomplish and        55    00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.280    that the Kennedy School nobly agreed to        56    00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.770    host finally in the spring time came the        57    00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.570    historic merger between Harvard        58    00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.170    University and Radcliffe College        59    00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.610    promising to escalate the Radcliffe        60    00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.110    mission of nurturing women for home        61    00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.150    community and world leadership        62    00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.359    we marvel at how far we have come since        63    00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.100    100 years ago when the Harvard class of        64    00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:32.960    1899 was all white and all-male and yet        65    00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.400    when we survey the current state of        66    00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.200    affairs in this nation from the tragic        67    00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.479    bloodshed in Jasper Texas and in New        68    00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.889    York City to the rollback on civil        69    00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.020    rights gains in Washington State and        70    00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.520    California to the repeated out cries for        71    00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.950    an even greater level of gender        72    00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.530    diversity and racial inclusion at        73    00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.110    liberal institutions including Harvard        74    00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.610    we're then hit with a stirring reality        75    00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.150    that our woods are indeed lovely dark        76    00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.020    and deep but we have promises to keep        77    00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.039    and miles to go before we sleep and        78    00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:29.340    miles to go before we sleep those words        79    00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.289    of Robert Frost who by the way was a        80    00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.970    student at Harvard in that year of 1899        81    00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.620    remind me now of the words of President        82    00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.169    rudenstine as he recalled mr. Mandela's        83    00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.280    release from prison he said Nelson        84    00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.600    Mandela has taught us all that there is        85    00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.560    no easy walk to freedom but he has also        86    00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.220    shown us that however hard it is one of        87    00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.849    the only walks worth taking in doing so        88    00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.340    he has reinvigorated the democratic        89    00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.010    ideals for all of us on that note I        90    00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.750    would be remiss if I did not say what        91    00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.139    has been for me the greatest miracle of        92    00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:20.310    all this year for who would have        93    00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.600    believed        94    00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.530    that this country girl who grew up in a        95    00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.389    warm and loving home in the south with        96    00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:36.669    no running water no indoor plumbing who        97    00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:38.500    strayed and became a teenage delinquent        98    00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.889    a disruptive student a mother applying        99    00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:50.169    for welfare at the age of 15 who would        100    00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:52.690    have believed that I would have made it        101    00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.340    thus far on my way        102    00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.420    [Music]        103    00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.810    the fact the fact that even on out from        104    00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.660    my weary past could have earned the        105    00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.580    opportunity to stand here today as a        106    00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.100    Harvard graduate is a testament to the        107    00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.400    hope that true freedom through prayerful        108    00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.730    determination hard work and reaching out        109    00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.550    can breathe does this not to give hope        110    00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.540    for the American Dream and I am thankful        111    00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.360    to Harvard University and to mr.        112    00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.130    Wasserman for the William S Wasserman        113    00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.380    fellowship that has afforded me this        114    00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.430    opportunity for this wonderful education        115    00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.220    for as I see it our walk within our        116    00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.470    national and global responsibilities in        117    00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.070    the years to come may not be easy but it        118    00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:54.680    will be possible if true democracy is to        119    00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.630    overcome social bias in America if true        120    00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.750    democracy is to overcome economic        121    00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.450    injustice from second Street to Wall        122    00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:10.510    Street if true democracy is to overcome        123    00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.390    ethnic strife and bloodshed and the        124    00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.850    killing of children and adults alike in        125    00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.270    places like Kosovo around the world and        126    00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:24.890    here at home then our sophisticated PR        127    00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.530    campaigns and spend doctors of the 21st        128    00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.920    century must be combined with a humane        129    00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.990    strategy that will make our deeds as        130    00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.680    glorious as our words Justice Thurgood        131    00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:45.850    Marshall said it best on July 4th 1992        132    00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:51.710    we cannot play ostrich democracy cannot        133    00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.980    flourish amid fear        134    00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.280    Liberty cannot bloom amid hate justice        135    00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.240    cannot take root amid rage we must go        136    00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.960    against the prevailing wind we must        137    00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.840    dissent from the fear the hatred and the        138    00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.770    mistrust        139    00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.150    we must dissent

in        6    00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:42.420    South Africa came to see me she did not        7    00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.500    beat about the bush        8    00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.180    she said if my father was still alive        9    00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.840    she would have been 70 you are 70 and I        10    00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.610    came here to see how a man of 70 looks        11    00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.150    like now I am 18        12    00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.450    and I'm very encouraged to see so many        13    00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:36.070    people who have turned up but I'm not so        14    00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.899    sure whether many of you have not come        15    00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.509    here to see how a man of eighteen looks        16    00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.720    like        17    00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.850    I keep on asking my wife and my        18    00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.860    colleagues

21    00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.540    how appropriate it is for me to repeat        22    00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.290    the story that is when I found some        23    00:02:25.290 -->

  26    00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.299    she said you are speaking to me        27    00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.819    I said well lady I know I'm speaking to        28    00:02:44.819 -->

  33    00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.910    name she became very close and she said        34    00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.750    you seem to be a professor have you        35    00:03:12.750 -->

00:03:29.770    you is the possession of a metric        41    00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.670    certificate        42    00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.830    I might work hard and pass by mitrik and

   nation and of the world I know that        58    00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.840    through this award you are not so much        59    00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.000    of recognizing any individual        60    00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.230    achievement but a rather paying tribute        61    00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.710    to the struggles and achievements of the        62    00:05:09.710

at a specially convened        72    00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.340    convocation is not only a singular honor        73    00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.949    it also holds a greater symbolic        74    00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:19.319    significance to the mind and to the        75    00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:22.499    future memory of this great American        76    00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:26.759    institution the name of an African is        77    00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:30.820    now added to those two alaska's middle        78    00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:52.779    [Applause]        79    00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:17.039    I have said before that one of the        80    00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:22.229    striking features of modern times is the        81    00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:29.220    emergence of men and women and indeed of        82    00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.240    institutions that have chosen the world        83    00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:39.960    as the theater of the operation as the        84    00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:45.090    platform from which to ventilate they        85    00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:51.990    are thinking and their ideas few people        86    00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:56.099    will deny that at the University of        87    00:07:56.099 --> 00:07:59.479    Harvard is one of those institutions        88    00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:05.150    that have chosen the entire way in order        89    00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.320    to bring a strength and hope to those        90    00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.530    who otherwise would have had their no        91    00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.620    future at all and I wanted to        92    00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.530    congratulate this university for the        93    00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.800    sterling effort it has made in order to        94    00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.159    ensure that had those who have been        95    00:08:26.159 --> 00:08:32.520    denied opportunities for degrees can now        96    00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:39.750    serve if in these later years of life        97    00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.349    lived in pursuit of equality we can at        98    00:08:43.349 --> 00:08:47.190    last look upon our own country as one in        99    00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:51.110    which citizens regardless of race gender        100    00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:55.170    okay say equal political rights and        101    00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.649    opportunities for development we do so        102    00:08:58.649 --> 00:09:01.320    with great gratitude towards the        103    00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.560    millions upon millions all around the        104    00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.940    world who materially the development who        105    00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.610    materially and morally supported our        106    00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.320    struggle for freedom and justice        107    00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.120    together with those freedom and just        108    00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.260    loving        109    00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.470    citizens of Justice loving citizens of        110    00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.820    the world we do at the same time however        111    00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.890    note adopted at the end of this century        112    00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.520    a century which humanity entered with        113    00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.270    such high hopes of progress the world is        114    00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.360    still beset by great disparity between        115    00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.630    the rich and the poor both within        116    00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.540    countries and between different parts of        117    00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:53.070    the world if in individual life we all        118    00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.820    may reach that part of the long walk        119    00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.860    where the opportunity is granted to        120    00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.570    retire to some rest and tranquillity for        121    00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.820    Humanity the walk to freedom and        122    00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.540    equality seems a lot still to be a long        123    00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:14.390    one I have this August institution        124    00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:18.900    Keynes is standard and reputation also        125    00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.210    from the manner in which it has        126    00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:24.000    conducted and continues to conduct        127    00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.420    itself as an international presence        128    00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.620    wherever men and women of learning and        129    00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:41.120    thought together his name and work know        130    00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.630    it embodies that spirit of universality        131    00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:49.410    which amongst a great university to join        132    00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.530    the ranks of the alumni is to be        133    00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:56.850    reminded of the oneness of our global        134    00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:00.530    world the greatest single challenge        135    00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:04.380    facing about globalized world is to        136    00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.980    combat to convert and eradicate its        137    00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.760    disparity one in all parts of the world        138    00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.210    their progress is being made in        139    00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.590    enchanting democratic forms of        140    00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:20.130    government we constantly need to remind        141    00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.770    ourselves that the freedoms which        142    00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:26.750    democracy bring will remain aunty sure        143    00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.760    if they        144    00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.480    accompanied by real and tangible        145    00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.850    improvement in the material lives of the        146    00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.519    millions of ordinary citizens of those        147    00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:39.580    countries        148    00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:51.750    [Applause]        149    00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:57.220    we're men and women and children go        150    00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:01.600    burdened with hunger suffering from        151    00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.069    preventable diseases languishing in        152    00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:10.089    ignorance and illiteracy of finding        153    00:12:10.089 --> 00:12:13.290    themselves bereft of distant shelter        154    00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:18.220    talk of democracy and freedom that does        155    00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.579    not recognize this material husband can        156    00:12:21.579 --> 00:12:24.790    ring hollow and erode to confidence        157    00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.879    exactly in those values we seek to        158    00:12:27.879 --> 00:12:32.800    promote hence our universal obligation        159    00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.470    towards the building of a world in which        160    00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.720    had there shall be greater equality        161    00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.319    among nations and among citizens of        162    00:12:41.319 --> 00:12:46.180    nations the disparity between the        163    00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:50.170    developed and developing world between        164    00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:54.189    north and south reflects itself also in        165    00:12:54.189 --> 00:12:57.240    the sphere of educational and        166    00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.689    intellectual resources when in Africa we        167    00:13:01.689 --> 00:13:05.490    speak and dream off and work for a        168    00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:08.980    rebirth of that continent as the full        169    00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.439    participant in the affairs of the world        170    00:13:11.439 --> 00:13:14.920    in the next century we are deeply        171    00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.240    conscious of how dependent that is on        172    00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.399    the mobilization and strengthening of        173    00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:26.019    the continent resources of learning the        174    00:13:26.019 --> 00:13:29.139    current world financial crisis also        175    00:13:29.139 --> 00:13:32.379    snugly reminds us that many of the        176    00:13:32.379 --> 00:13:35.319    concepts that guided our sense of how        177    00:13:35.319 --> 00:13:39.490    the world and its affairs death ordered        178    00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:43.170    have suddenly been shown to be wanted        179    00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.939    they are seen to have hidden real        180    00:13:45.939 --> 00:13:49.240    structural defect in the world economic        181    00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.290    system the pieces of the economic        182    00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:57.069    theories who could so confidently        183    00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:58.540    prescribe to all        184    00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.690    now appear to have brought much of their        185    00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.230    apparent intellectual validation from        186    00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.900    having been unchallenged by the        187    00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:11.070    day-to-day operation of a system that        188    00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.770    operated in the interest of the powerful        189    00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.990    and not the poorest of the poor        190    00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:31.440    not only does this crisis call for        191    00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.230    fundamental rethinking and the        192    00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.200    conceptualization on the part of the        193    00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.550    theories or the not it more particularly        194    00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:44.940    and urgently emphasizes they need for        195    00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.310    thinkers

Harvard or benefited from programs        210    00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.770    conducted jointly with this institution        211    00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:50.310    for that our fledgling democracy faced        212    00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.500    with a normal stance of Reconstruction        213    00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.650    and Development all your institution a        214    00:15:55.650 --> 00:16:00.000    great debt of gratitude as South        215    00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.210    Africans play their role in helping to        216    00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:06.990    conceptualize and give content to the        217    00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:10.470    African relations we continue to draw        218    00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.650    upon the intellectual skills nurtured        219    00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:18.030    and hold here the United States of        220    00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:22.140    America and democratic South Africa have        221    00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.500    in the course of these last four years        222    00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.320    built a relationship of mutual respect        223    00:16:28.320 -->

African it is therefore a        231    00:16:56.759 --> 00:16:58.709    source of great encouragement and        232    00:16:58.709 --> 00:17:02.699    inspiration for us to learn about the

well I        271    00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.300    have given you a glimpse of what some        272    00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.810    South Africans think of the president I        273    00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:18.720    think it would be unfair to close at        274    00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.190    this address without getting a more        275    00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.100    vivid picture of what to some South        276    00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:31.290    African think of this man when I turned        277    00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:37.710    75 a young lady was it was reported that        278    00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.020    there was a young lady of about 5 head        279    00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:45.390    gate of my house and they say she wants        280    00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:52.980    to see you I said let Akane SH orator        281    00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:54.390    said mr. president and she is very        282    00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.960    cheeky        283    00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:59.070    I say precisely for that reason let her        284    00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:06.150    come she came in and indeed she was a        285    00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:10.980    great lady she did not know should it        286    00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:17.270    not good she just said how old are you I        287    00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:22.050    said what I can't remember but I was        288    00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:26.190    gone long long ago she said two years        289    00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:31.890    ago I said no

   25    00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.070    experience in research directing editing        26    00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.689    public health journals        27    00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.170    there was a tradition in my ancestral        28    00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.310    land of India it is called Southie it is        29    00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.229    the ancient practice of casting a woman        30    00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.330    alive into the funeral pyre of her dead        31    00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.340    husband in an out of respect and        32    00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.340    Allegiance        33    00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.659    there is another tradition in this world        34    00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.110    called racism it allows inequities to be        35    00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.420    propagated and gives some the right to        36    00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.430    destroy others merely because they speak        37    00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.729    another language worship another god or        38    00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.050    have another skin color but there is        39    00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.330    also a tradition carried from generation        40    00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.890    to generation through the millennia        41    00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.390    which is known as love it is the emotion        42    00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.519    which binds the human condition and it        43    00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.180    is a tradition of Hope it is also a        44    00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.880    tradition often not recognized as a        45    00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.330    tradition as an Indian woman I have        46    00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.450    great experience with tradition as a        47    00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.580    student at Harvard I have been involved        48    00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.180    in redefining tradition raised in the        49    00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.640    strict traditions of the past I was        50    00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.799    taught not to question tradition because        51    00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.370    tradition was truth I was given rituals        52    00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.489    to symbolize right and wrong and shown        53    00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.239    how to be a proper lady a proper Indian        54    00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.390    woman a proper health professional and I        55    00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.700    unaware gave away my will and suppressed        56    00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.540    the fire inside my heart arranged        57    00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.410    marriages son's not daughter's life is        58    00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.329    an object of adornment and as a symbol        59    00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.160    of fertility these are the traditions I        60    00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.480    inherited as an Indian woman conformity        61    00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.220    submission jumping through the hoops of        62    00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.500    academic training these are also the        63    00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.180    realities of working as a health        64    00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.310    professional with the in rigid tradition        65    00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.640    I know that to survive in many jobs a        66    00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.829    woman must be far more competent than        67    00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.970    the men around her        68    00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.530    know what to do with people like me I am        69    00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.720    neither unqualified nor perfectly        70    00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.480    qualified in the eyes of tradition I am        71    00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.280    armed with traditions of privilege and        72    00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.530    like many of us here today I quest to        73    00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.660    reshape that tradition for those coming        74    00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.680    after us tradition has a strong        75    00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.570    influence here at Harvard we have        76    00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.430    learned to preserve the great lessons of        77    00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.250    the past the history of man's quest for        78    00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.760    freedom the beauty of nature the        79    00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.620    writings of women and men whose lives        80    00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.240    symbolize courage strength and life but        81    00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.890    in how many classes of your professors        82    00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.140    ask you to use these traditions to look        83    00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.320    inside to heal yourself in your heart so        84    00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.320    that you can be strong from your core        85    00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.330    perhaps not to look inside is also a        86    00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.680    tradition I was sent to college not only        87    00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.010    for an education but to lower my dowry        88    00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.690    to increase my value to the man who        89    00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.450    would next own me it was during those        90    00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.180    years however that I grew free not        91    00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.740    because of my classes but because I        92    00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.720    dared to look inside and became        93    00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.780    intrigued with the questions of healing        94    00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.630    by looking inside I was forced to accept        95    00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.230    myself to take responsibility for my        96    00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.350    day-to-day choices to feel and know the        97    00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.840    consequences of my own power and visions        98    00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.050    in this world as I studied these        99    00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.060    questions of healing were strangely        100    00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.430    avoided and dismissed by my mentors and        101    00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.940    peers at school as personal but let me        102    00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.210    ask is your education not personal and        103    00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.790    does not your ability to help in to        104    00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.290    teach others depend upon your own        105    00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.630    integrity and strength and confidence as        106    00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.620    a person the purpose of tradition is to        107    00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.780    guide us with knowledge not to entrap us        108    00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.970    in blind following which suppresses our        109    00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.210    spirits we must use tradition only as a        110    00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.280    reference point in learning to trust        111    00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.040    ourselves to find truth in the        112    00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.780    foundation of our hearts and not merely        113    00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.670    in the confirmation of others and        114    00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.210    is gone we must Mel the tradition of        115    00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.040    doing what is good for humankind with        116    00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.660    the other traditions handed down to us        117    00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.480    and then we must pass it on in the        118    00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.230    tradition of love my education in public        119    00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.330    health this year has shown me the        120    00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.890    problems we have in our healthcare        121    00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.990    system today because we propagate those        122    00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.120    traditions that do not work for us the        123    00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.600    way they did in decades past I came to        124    00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.610    study here to give power to the passion        125    00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.680    in my soul that binds me to help those        126    00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.020    around us who are too depressed to cry        127    00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.750    for help what I have learned is that        128    00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.450    until we can heal ourselves we cannot        129    00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.340    understand health and help others to        130    00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.820    achieve it until we also learn that        131    00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.580    healing happens when we are able to give        132    00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.160    as part of getting how can we be a        133    00:06:29.160 -->

It was the first time since 1946 that a member of the military had given the commencement speech.  In 1946 it was General George Marshall.  He announced the Marshall Plan.  General Colin Powell announced the Powell Plan - not in those words but in the idea.  Powell announced that the U.S. was going to finance and assist in the rebuilding of Russia and the independent states as the U.S. financed and assisted in the rebuilding of Europe following

forces and the        70    00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.879    people were as one in their moment of        71    00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.799    victory in our Getty celebration of        72    00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.640    Peace we demobilized our Armed Forces we        73    00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.760    stacked our arms we sent our GIS home to        74    00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.319    raise their families to make their        75    00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.640    fortunes and to make their contribution        76    00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.840    to our        77    00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.319    society but the party soon        78    00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.760    ended and we awoke with a hangover        79    00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.680    called        80    00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.000    communism and it soon became clear that        81    00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.480    America could not simply tip its hat to        82    00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.280    a grateful world and go home the        83    00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.120    exhausted world of 1946 was building its        84    00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.439    hopes on this

87    00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.840    still had a duty to perform and our own        88    00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.799    future depended on us doing that Duty        89    00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.319    and it's a duty we've done and we've        90    00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.239    done well ever since        91    00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.920    1947 when George Marshall came here to        92    00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.519    Harvard and stood on this        93    00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.879    platform perhaps the most famous speech        94    00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.720    ever delivered here he committed        95    00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.159    America's wealth and America's        96    00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.920    leadership to the task of rebuilding        97    00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.079    Europe and of ensuring its peace and        98    00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.280    prosperity there could be no going back        99    00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.919    after that there could be no more        100    00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.479    turning a blind eye to the world we had        101    00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.639    to be of the world not just in it and in        102    00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.479    the years that followed we led a Grand        103    00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.560    Alliance through the cold war that long        104    00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.360    awful Twilight struggle with tragic        105    00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.479    surrogate conflicts in such far away        106    00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.240    places as Korea and        107    00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.919    Vietnam most of my adult life was spent        108    00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.120    fighting the Cold War it has also been        109    00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.759    my great thrill and privilege to see it        110    00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.990    all now come to an        111    00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.160    [Applause]        112    00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.560    end        113    00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.960    for me the end began in November of 1987        114    00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.880    as I sat in the Hall of St Catherine in        115    00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.360    the Kremlin alongside the Secretary of        116    00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.000    State across the table from us was the        117    00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.919    General Secretary of the Communist party        118    00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:20.039    mik        119    00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.199    gorbachov I was National Security        120    00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.639    adviser to President Reagan at the time        121    00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.479    and this man gorbachov was saying to my        122    00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.440    astonishment that the leninist        123    00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.680    experiment had failed that he gorbachov        124    00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.360    was going to Institute a sweeping reform        125    00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.680    of the Soviet system he was going to try        126    00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.000    to adapt lenen to the modern world to        127    00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.240    the world that was flourishing on our        128    00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.360    side of the Iron        129    00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.560    Curtain back in 1987 to this poor        130    00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.280    infantry officer that was heady stuff        131    00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.720    unbelievable stuff yet in the        132    00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.440    breathtaking months that followed it all        133    00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.440    came about the cold war did come to an        134    00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.240    end and leninism was not reformed it was        135    00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.960    rejected by its        136    00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.080    own owners swept aside along with the        137    00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.080    burlin wall the Iron Curtain the Warsaw        138    00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.599    pack and ultimately Mr gorbachov        139    00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:17.520    himself and now here we are in 1993        140    00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.360    again as in        141    00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.720    1946 a war behind us we are again        142    00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.720    Victorious triumphant ready to face the        143    00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.800    future ready to turn from thoughts of        144    00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.120    War to the pursuit of prosperity ready        145    00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.639    to turn from the Twilight Struggle to a        146    00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:35.759    new dawn of promise and        147    00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:38.039    progress but this        148    00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:41.639    time we are a little older we must be a        149    00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:42.440    little        150    00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.960    wiser we must be less willing than we        151    00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.560    were 47 years ago to believe that        152    00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.680    history has ended and the new this new        153    00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.440    chapter of history that has just opened        154    00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.400    is making cfes demands on our view of        155    00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.520    the world on our sense of what is real        156    00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.720    and predictable and what        157    00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.120    isn't to be sure this new world has much        158    00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.639    good news in it already although        159    00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:09.960    fitfully democracy is making Headway        160    00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.280    throughout the world in Latin America        161    00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.199    Africa in Asia yes with setbacks but        162    00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:17.919    nevertheless we can see the steady        163    00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:20.720    progress of democracy we have watched a        164    00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.960    democratically elected Russian president        165    00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.000    Boris yelson battle his way from the top        166    00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.319    of a tank towards a vision of freedom        167    00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:30.319    and economic reform        168    00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:33.400    and recently we saw this Mr yelson meet        169    00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.319    with a new Young American president in        170    00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:37.840    Vancouver British Columbia and talk not        171    00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.479    about nuclear missiles and        172    00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:41.520    confrontations but rather talk about        173    00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.919    economic partnership and a shared vision        174    00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:46.360    of freedom and        175    00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.599    democracy but I must digress for a        176    00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:52.000    moment and ask what happened to my        177    00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.680    colleague Mr gorbachov what happened to        178    00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.639    the man who set this revolution in        179    00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:58.000    motion even though he himself turned out        180    00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.400    not to be a        181    00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.400    revolutionary he did not go into the        182    00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.919    dust bin of history in fact Mr gorbachov        183    00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:08.039    has entered fully into the capitalist        184    00:08:08.039 --> 00:08:10.720    Spirit of things just a few weeks ago        185    00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.199    you may have noted he delivered a series        186    00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:16.440    of very profitable speeches in Virginia        187    00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.840    in honor of the 250th birthday of Thomas        188    00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.440    Jefferson and that very same week he        189    00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.360    opened an environmental Institute at one        190    00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.280    of my precious former Army bases at the        191    00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.960    city of San Francisco is this a great        192    00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.680    country or        193    00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.200    what this new world we have entered is        194    00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.959    one where our domestic and international        195    00:08:55.959 --> 00:08:58.800    obligations will pull us in different        196    00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.680    and sep sep directions where old        197    00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.160    formulas for computing our national        198    00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.320    interest no longer give us clear answers        199    00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.519    the world map no longer has nice neat        200    00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:12.200    line separating friend from foe it is        201    00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.839    pocked instead with the sores of a dozen        202    00:09:14.839 --> 00:09:16.880    tragic places with a host of Once and        203    00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.040    Future Iraq Somalia bosnas and north        204    00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.560    koreas in this turbulent New Era where        205    00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.320    power is more diffused where we are        206    00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.240    grappling with the sudden reemergence of        207    00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.480    19th century conflicts we are once again        208    00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.360    seen as the great vigorous Cano Nation        209    00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.320    on which the world is still pinning its        210    00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.720    hopes the world is depending on the        211    00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.120    power of our democracy on the power of        212    00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.320    250 million Americans to do what's right        213    00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.519    that world still looks up to America it        214    00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:51.240    still turns to us for leadership we have        215    00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.720    the responsibility to respond as Winston        216    00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.200    Churchill said from this platform for        217    00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.480    the class of 1943 50 years ago the price        218    00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.959    of greatness is        219    00:10:03.959 --> 00:10:06.000    responsibility and we will be judged in        220    00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.440    the future classrooms of Harvard by        221    00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.640    whether we rise to that responsibility        222    00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.600    we will be judged kindly if we throw        223    00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.200    ourselves with all our creative Vigor        224    00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.440    first into the industry of America into        225    00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.279    creating for ourselves and our children        226    00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:22.760    the prosperity that brightens lives and        227    00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.399    underwrites the progress of our culture        228    00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:28.120    so the restoration of our own economy        229    00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.720    must be the foundation Stone of our role        230    00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.200    in the new        231    00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.120    world we will be judged kindly if we        232    00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.680    renew the values of our communities        233    00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.720    values of service of family of        234    00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.320    compassion of wisdom we can't aspire to        235    00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.440    Greatness unless we begin with a        236    00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.360    foundation as well of values and we will        237    00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.279    be judged kindly if we respond to this        238    00:10:52.279

right to the speaker so we        120    00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.280    could get it over with        121    00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.199    now that i'm the person being introduced        122    00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.160    i just love them        123    00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.919    after all when was the last time you        124    00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.840    heard an introduction may i introduce        125    00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.199    the barely adequate        126    00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.960    speaker for today kindness always makes        127    00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.360    people exaggerate one's virtues        128    00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.120    but at this stage in my life i don't        129    00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.040    believe a little exaggeration is that        130    00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.360    harmful and so dean i'm extraordinarily        131    00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.160    grateful for your kindness today        132    00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.080    but it isn't my day after all it is        133    00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.080    yours it is        134    00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.360    for the graduates of the kennedy school        135    00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.800    of government        136    00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.960    as a republican i'm allowed to say that        137    00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.720    not only will you have a degree        138    00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.759    you will also soon have better cash flow        139    00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.479    and that makes it an exciting time for        140    00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:23.039    you        141    00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.479    and for spouses and for        142    00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.639    parents or for anyone else who's been        143    00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.520    part of your educational experience        144    00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.919    in fact all over america the last few        145    00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.120    weeks there have been commencement        146    00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.960    speakers        147    00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.600    in high schools grammar schools colleges        148    00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.080    universities and probably 98        149    00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.520    of them talked about beginnings        150    00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.800    from the latin word commencement and how        151    00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.000    you're all going to        152    00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.120    start this new path but that really        153    00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.320    doesn't fit here        154    00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.880    because you've already experienced more        155    00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.639    than one beginning        156    00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.720    and actually you came back to the        157    00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.560    kennedy school        158    00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.680    to for different reasons you are        159    00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.880    looking for something else for different        160    00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.639    answers different methods different        161    00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:11.759    systems        162    00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.400    all in an effort to somehow merge public        163    00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.000    practice        164    00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.280    and private ambition but you also know        165    00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.120    that we're facing a world that's not        166    00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.639    just evolving rapidly but a world where        167    00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:25.759    a revolution        168    00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:28.880    although albeit sometimes subtle is        169    00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.880    occurring within the united states and        170    00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.960    that means ultimately the world        171    00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.800    this is a revolution of the workplace        172    00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.639    the revolution based on culture        173    00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:40.319    and change with dramatic implications        174    00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.680    lately for instance you and i know        175    00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.960    there's been a rush to condemn the        176    00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.919    eighties        177    00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:47.120    greed gluttony the seven deadly sins        178    00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.000    are seemingly enlarged and exaggerated        179    00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000    by every motion every practice every        180    00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.840    process that people have observed in        181    00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.280    that        182    00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.840    just soon almost forgotten decade        183    00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.479    at least that's what everyone says but        184    00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:04.800    during this supposed period of rampant        185    00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.520    materialism there was if one looks        186    00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.039    and you don't have to look actually that        187    00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:10.720    closely        188    00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.840    some very positive areas        189    00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.120    one of those areas was called jobs        190    00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.120    and whether one was a liberal democrat        191    00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.800    for massachusetts or a conservative        192    00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.240    republican from texas        193    00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.759    there was an enormous range of        194    00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:26.000    opportunities graduates        195    00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.840    at all levels found themselves being        196    00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.759    approached for jobs        197    00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:32.160    and jobs at salaries that a few years        198    00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.199    before would have been        199    00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:35.919    fantasy the argument was not where one        200    00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:37.440    was going to work        201    00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.039    it was one could one afford to make        202    00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:43.280    the enormous sacrifice to stay in public        203    00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.039    service when there was so much more        204    00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:48.160    money to be made in the towers of mammon        205    00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.400    we heard the glory of the sacrifice        206    00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.000    people were going to make        207    00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.720    by taking mere professorships instead of        208    00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.319    dominating the international        209    00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:59.759    trade market and now that ninety or the        210    00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:01.520    eighties and materialism        211    00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.319    is out in the nineties are here there        212    00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:07.039    seems to be one small problem        213    00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:08.879    those kinds of discussions are        214    00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:10.960    irrelevant as people seek        215    00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.960    career opportunities in a highly        216    00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.560    competitive world        217    00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.960    it turns out that an expanding economy        218    00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.440    wasn't such a bad thing after all        219    00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.759    and that when one is talking about        220    00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:23.680    sacrifice it is surprising how        221    00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.240    often the person speaking means that        222    00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.360    that sacrifice should be someone else's        223    00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.039    it means you graduates are not        224    00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:33.519    necessarily facing        225    00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:36.479    the wide open acceptance of your        226    00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:37.919    brilliance        227    00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:41.360    there is no want ad that says        228    00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.399    please a kennedy school graduate will        229    00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:44.720    pay        230    00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.000    100 000 a year for the pleasure of 2        231    00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.519    a.m conversations over beer and pizza        232    00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:54.560    nor are there ads that say state        233    00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.959    desperately needs kennedy school alum to        234    00:08:56.959 --> 00:08:57.920    put us again        235    00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.680    on that path from which we have strayed        236    00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.959    not only that but different people        237    00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:07.440    are beginning to compete for the same        238    00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.720    jobs        239    00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.959    and that makes it extraordinarily        240    00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:12.399    difficult        241    00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:15.360    for everyone when in fact we talk about        242    00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.600    the rigors of competition and how useful        243    00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.320    it is        244    00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.279    again there is a tendency to talk about        245    00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:24.480    how useful it is for someone else        246    00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.440    but if you look around that competition        247    00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.720    must        248    00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.920    should and ought be pushing others to        249    00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.200    examine        250    00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.320    the preparation you and this entire        251    00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.480    nation have received        252    00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.760    and indeed in particular for you        253    00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.440    how you've received it it does not mean        254    00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.519    or does not make your stay at the        255    00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:49.680    kennedy school less valuable        256    00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.120    but it may actually mean that the        257    00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.880    kennedy school itself        258    00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.040    must look at the preparation it is        259    00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.399    giving to the men        260    00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:59.440    and women who seek to be part of public        261    00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.279    and private policy making        262    00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:04.560    in generations to come in america one of        263    00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.240    those differences in one of the parts of        264    00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.240    competition that is changing rapidly is        265    00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.200    the makeup of the kennedy school itself        266    00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.720    in once a hallowed male bastion        267    00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.200    is now entering a class 50 percent of        268    00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.040    whom are women        269    00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.480    does this mean that the women of the        270    00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.720    kennedy school are less qualified        271    00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.360    than the males coming here does it mean        272    00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.760    that there has been some        273    00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.760    particularly odious form of affirmative        274    00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.760    action        275    00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.079    assure you that when the women write the        276    00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:36.399    huge texts required here for        277    00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:41.760    tuition no one questions their abilities        278    00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:44.720    in a school that wisely looks to provide        279    00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.640    for leadership for the future        280    00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.079    it must also look at itself it is simply        281    00:10:50.079 --> 00:10:52.240    not acceptable to have a school with the        282    00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.839    stature of the kennedy school of        283    00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:54.640    government        284    00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.600    talking about what to do about poverty        285    00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.120    what to do about the issues of        286    00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.160    governance        287    00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.079    what to do about the future of this        288    00:11:02.079 --> 00:11:05.760    place this country this planet        289    00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.720    without tenured women without a tenured        290    00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.480    african-american        291    00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.600    and even claim to responsibly and        292    00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.279    responsibly reflect        293    00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:18.560    the future of america in the world there        294    00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.760    are those that say        295    00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:28.399    give more time        296    00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:32.720    that is an excuse heard too often        297    00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.320    only those who wish to make excuses can        298    00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.839    continue to use that stale alibi        299    00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:44.000    but will it be difficult yes        300    00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.320    will it require change for harvard        301    00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.800    yes but if there is no change        302    00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.760    the future will pass even this great        303    00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.079    institution by        304    00:11:58.079 --> 00:12:01.360    it is also true when changes occur other        305    00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.880    changes must follow        306    00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.920    you do not educate huge groups of people        307    00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.560    and that's what we've done for and with        308    00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.079    the women of america        309    00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:12.160    here or in the rest of the world and        310    00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.079    then tell them        311    00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:15.839    to stay out of the decision-making        312    00:12:15.839 --> 00:12:17.279    process        313    00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:18.880    just as you cannot have a school        314    00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.440    maintain its position if it cannot have        315    00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.480    the best        316    00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.959    a nation cannot maintain its position        317    00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:27.279    without striving for excellence        318    00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:30.639    to exclude any group is not appropriate        319    00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:33.839    nor does it suit the needs of our nation        320    00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:36.000    which must use the talents of all of our        321    00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.200    people        322    00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.480    if we are to have a nation where merit        323    00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.279    truly counts then merit cannot be based        324    00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:43.600    on        325    00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.880    old boy networks or tired formula        326    00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.480    it must be based on excellence        327    00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.320    and for men and women alike        328    00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.440    there are therefore new challenges it        329    00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.160    means using your skills graduate to make        330    00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.639    sure people aren't shunted aside        331    00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:05.040    but are welcomed as part of america's        332    00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.600    continued quest for tomorrow        333    00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.360    it won't always be comfortable pioneers        334    00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.600    after all do not always know the trails        335    00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.160    they don't even know where they'll end        336    00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.240    researchers don't have the answers        337    00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.920    before they start their work        338    00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.279    so in a world where        339    00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:30.079    many people say there are no frontiers        340    00:13:30.079 --> 00:13:30.880    left        341    00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.600    there is nothing left to do the        342    00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.600    graduates of the kennedy school        343    00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.680    can make a real difference business        344    00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.120    family government making them        345    00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.240    work counts        346    00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.760    and with the education that you have        347    00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.519    received here        348    00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:52.959    you can be part of that process        349    00:13:52.959 --> 00:13:56.079    the age of exploration is        350    00:13:56.079 --> 00:13:59.440    not over you will be part of new        351    00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.959    expeditions not        352    00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:04.880    of outer space alone but of society        353    00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.760    itself        354    00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.199    as we move forward you yes        355    00:14:09.199 --> 00:14:12.560    you can be part of the first        356    00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.360    group of real leaders that end the        357    00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.079    politics        358    00:14:16.079 --> 00:14:19.680    of blame and start the policies        359    00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.720    of opportunity for women        360    00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.360    it means examining choices and taking        361    00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.880    responsibility for risking        362    00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.160    failure it means        363    00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.320    for women not blaming others when the        364    00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.360    choices are difficult        365    00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.360    it means not having all of the answers        366    00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.120    at the start        367    00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.639    and still moving forward        368    00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:54.240    for men it should not mean        369    00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.000    and need not mean stepping aside        370    00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.839    or even moving back it means        371    00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:04.720    walking forward with now partners        372    00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.040    instead of dependents        373    00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.519    and it means men and women working        374    00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:11.199    together        375    00:15:11.199 --> 00:15:15.440    in shared causes shared commitments        376    00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.399    and a shared desire for a better life        377    00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:19.440    not just        378    00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.480    for them but for the young men and the        379    00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.720    young women in generations to come        380    00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.600    after being here at the kennedy school i        381    00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.399    believe        382    00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:33.839    you can do it        383    00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:35.759    a hundred years ago when i graduated        384    00:15:35.759 --> 00:15:36.880    from college        385    00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.199    i knew what my life would be        386    00:15:41.199 --> 00:15:44.880    after all i had an english major        387    00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.920    i specialized having a very practical        388    00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.360    mind in the 18th century        389    00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.519    so i knew i would marry and have        390    00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:55.120    children        391    00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.440    little did i know that my work in the        392    00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.600    18th century would have so well prepared        393    00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.360    me for the mindset of the congress of        394    00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:09.839    the united states        395    00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.000    i did not fight        396    00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.519    what my life was meant to be        397    00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.160    to marry to have children        398    00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.680    seemed and still seems to me        399    00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.560    a wonderful part of one's life a part        400    00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.839    that one wishes for others        401    00:16:31.839 --> 00:16:34.880    but as a woman of that generation        402    00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.399    i looked for no more        403    00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:40.720    the fact i had been a student senator        404    00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.800    did i think i could be a united states        405    00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.000    senator of course not        406    00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.440    did i joan of arc like fight against the        407    00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.639    fires of the stake        408    00:16:50.639 --> 00:16:53.839    of course not i        409    00:16:53.839 --> 00:16:56.399    married a week after i graduated i had a        410    00:16:56.399 --> 00:16:58.720    child nine months and two weeks counted        411    00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:05.120    reduced to them after i graduated        412    00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.640    and saw ahead of me without recognizing        413    00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.160    a huge blank        414    00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:15.199    a blank        415    00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.839    that i assumed would never fill        416    00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.760    you today face no        417    00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.520    such blanks but the same        418    00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.039    education the same        419    00:17:31.039 --> 00:17:34.640    reading the same skills        420    00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.679    have to prepare you for an even        421    00:17:37.679 --> 00:17:41.039    more extraordinary change that has        422    00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:43.760    happened in my life        423    00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.799    you may not have blanks        424    00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:51.039    but you still cannot know the future        425    00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.480    the difference i believe now is        426    00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.679    that you are set        427    00:17:57.679 --> 00:17:59.919    that's what the

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.480    agreed to take some questions so we've        439    00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.840    got a couple of microphones here that        440    00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.720    make things        441    00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.160    easier for people to hear if they would        442    00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.760    go to the microphone and maybe just        443    00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.120    identify themselves there are also a        444    00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.840    couple of up there        445    00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.480    how can this be such a bashful i cannot        446    00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.320    believe at the kennedy school        447    00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.480    let me know i have to make one comment        448

all of these things        466    00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.559    that one does        467    00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:02.240    um thank you very much for your talk my        468    00:20:02.240 -->

  00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.600    and um in terms of        472    00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.760    listening to your speech and to myself        473    00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.640    personally        474    00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.600    as a as a white male you mentioned that        475    00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.960    males don't need to        476    00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.200    step aside or need to even take a step        477    00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.000    back        478    00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.400    and i'm just wondering what what        479    00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.280    specific        480    00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.039    how do you what suggestions do you have        481    00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:28.080    for for white males in today's        482    00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.080    from my vast experience of being a white        483    00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.320    male uh        484    00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.600    joe let me tell you you know they used        485    00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.840    to always ask me in fact when i started        486    00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.600    in politics um        487    00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.360    how does it feel to be a woman in        488    00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.360    politics i never knew how to answer that        489    00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.159    either        490    00:20:42.159 --> 00:20:44.480    since i'd been one most of my life what        491    00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.400    was it compared to what i mean you know        492    00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.520    but        493    00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.159    you're asking and and it seems to me        494    00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:53.280    you're showing some courage and saying        495    00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:58.000    wait a minute here is is my time over        496    00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.039    um my husband is pleased to note that i        497    00:21:01.039 --> 00:21:02.240    do believe        498    00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.000    although i've occasionally hinted that        499    00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.320    one sex may be more juvenile and more        500    00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.280    emotional        501    00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.480    that men should have equal rights        502    00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.880    so in that you're safe i think it's        503    00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.880    important to note that for        504    00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.760    yes for white males that it is        505    00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.120    absolutely        506    00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.159    foolish for women and minorities to        507    00:21:22.159 --> 00:21:24.480    expect them to be overjoyed at every        508    00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.159    moment with the changes going on        509    00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.760    when there is uh when there are 13        510    00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.520    people after a job        511    00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.720    and suddenly there are 23 people        512    00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.360    why should you welcome any competitors        513    00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.120    that doesn't make people racist        514    00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.480    or sexist to resent        515    00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.840    having had a better deal in some ways        516    00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.280    the overall question has to be are you        517    00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.200    going to be better off        518    00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.080    you as a white male and others the        519    00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.360    answer is        520    00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.520    if we aren't able to use the talents of        521    00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.520    over half of our population        522    00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.559    if we aren't able to have the abilities        523    00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:06.320    and skills of the minorities in our        524    00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.799    population we will all be less better        525    00:22:08.799 --> 00:22:09.440    off        526    00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.720    so there's an advantage but the truth in        527    00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.559    what i was saying today        528    00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:16.720    is something that is very hard for        529    00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.000    bright young        530    00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.440    people to understand        531    00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.919    this is not a television show with an        532    00:22:23.919 --> 00:22:26.480    ending in 30 minutes        533    00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.760    we don't have all the answers yet that's        534    00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.799    what you        535    00:22:30.799 --> 00:22:34.720    get to do how do you combine        536    00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.760    women tend to ask me home and family not        537    00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.799    well some of the time        538    00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:43.760    it isn't perfect how are you gonna have        539    00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.440    everything you want from life        540    00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.000    be fair to women be sensitive you know        541    00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.640    be alan alda and john wayne somehow        542    00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.400    which is it seems to me what people        543    00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.960    often feel they when you just want to be        544    00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.159    you        545    00:22:56.159 --> 00:22:58.400    and the answer is sometimes it's going        546    00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.640    to work and sometimes it's not        547    00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.440    the difference is if we all do this        548    00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.720    right and that's you        549    00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.840    more than even me who's aging you're        550    00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.000    going to be making some of these rules        551    00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.400    you're going to be able to experiment if        552    00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.720    you're willing to change        553    00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.720    in other words if you're willing to say        554    00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.679    this part of the relationships this part        555    00:23:19.679 --> 00:23:23.280    isn't working we'll try this        556    00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.799    women tried to be just like men i don't        557    00:23:26.799 --> 00:23:29.840    i shouldn't stereotype but        558    00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.159    i don't know if you remember women        559    00:23:32.159 --> 00:23:33.360    wearing sort of        560    00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.679    kind of gray suits with bowie things        561    00:23:35.679 --> 00:23:36.480    here        562    00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.400    it was an extraordinarily attractive        563    00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.120    look that        564    00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.360    even the thrift shops cannot get rid of        565    00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.880    okay you know        566    00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.120    it's a little like nehru jackets for men        567    00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.520    their time had never come and really        568    00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.720    they stayed alone        569    00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.520    a long time        570    00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.200    i think women are beginning to get too        571    00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.039    used to the idea of not being men        572    00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:00.960    and men are getting used to the idea of        573    00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.960    not having to be women        574    00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.000    that the strength of each other as        575    00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.200    as sexes can be complementary and as        576    00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.520    individuals are going to be as different        577    00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.159    as each individual in this room        578    00:24:14.159 --> 00:24:15.600    that there are going to be some women        579    00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.080    who want to be and ought to be president        580    00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.760    of the united states and some that want        581    00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.039    to stay home        582    00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:22.640    there are going to be some men who want        583    00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.640    to make their life in a wilderness and        584    00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.320    others who want to be in the city        585    00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.480    there are differences and that that        586    00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.559    growing respect        587    00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:38.240    will help but it isn't there yet        588    00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.600    thank you very much it isn't there yet        589    00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.840    you're going to help make it you're        590    00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.640    going to make it happen and the last bit        591    00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.360    of advice        592    00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.039    is the one your mother gave you when you        593    00:24:49.039 --> 00:24:50.480    were four        594    00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.720    because your mother is always right        595    00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.480    there is there are certain things that        596    00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.240    are true        597    00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.880    and that is in general when in doubt        598    00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.400    treat someone else the way you want to        599    00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.000    be treated        600    00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.640    tends to be pretty good advice yes        601    00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.400    with the exception of the dean he's paid        602    00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.559    to take flax so but with that exception        603    00:25:14.559 --> 00:25:17.200    my name's susan hamill i'm an mpp two        604    00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.880    here at the kennedy school        605    00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.039    i'm wondering what your plans are uh for        606    00:25:21.039 --> 00:25:21.919    the future        607    00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:24.640    since the gentleman you worked for uh        608    00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.240    lost the last election        609    00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.559    yes and i'm wondering in particular what        610    00:25:28.559 --> 00:25:29.600    your plans are for        611    00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.720    1996 yes uh        612    00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.880    uh        613    00:25:35.919 --> 00:25:37.679    um i don't know if you noticed it's very        614    00:25:37.679 --> 00:25:39.360    and i'm not joking and i        615    00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.400    and i        616    00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.320    the 80s the same time or the early 80s        617    00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.760    and 70s when we were wearing those same        618    00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:46.320    suits        619    00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:51.200    so that we look just like guys but worse        620    00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.240    you could never admit things i mean you        621    00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.559    as a woman you weren't allowed you        622    00:25:58.559 --> 00:26:00.880    and i resented and kept saying you know        623    00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.080    i am the        624    00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.480    congressman or i'm the representative        625    00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.080    now it doesn't say w        626    00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.480    by my name it says you know are from        627    00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.520    illinois        628    00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.960    nonetheless there are some things that        629    00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.640    are true it's very difficult for me for        630    00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.000    instance        631    00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.360    to accept applause i find that really        632    00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.080    hard        633    00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.559    because growing up you were there was a        634    00:26:20.559 --> 00:26:22.240    difference in how women and men were        635    00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.360    taught        636    00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.240    so i hope you understand this unlike        637    00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.760    many males in america        638    00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.919    i never wrote down what i wanted to be        639    00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.360    you know the yearbooks i want to be        640    00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.039    president i want to be senator i want to        641    00:26:35.039 --> 00:26:35.679    you know run        642    00:26:35.679 --> 00:26:39.200    general hey i want to go        643    00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.360    out saturday night you know some of the        644    00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.600    time is what i was thinking you know        645    00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.600    uh i'm not trying to disparage me i'm        646    00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.960    saying that's life        647    00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.840    that's been wonderful in a way men        648    00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.919    sometimes are so overwhelmed by both        649    00:26:51.919 --> 00:26:54.080    their ambition and the need to achieve        650    00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.440    what they've set out        651    00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.400    to do so i don't have an idea in the        652    00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.760    world        653    00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.400    i didn't know i was ever going to be in        654    00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.200    the cabinet        655    00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.480    of the president of the united states i        656    00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.679    still am awed by the fact i had that        657    00:27:09.679 --> 00:27:11.360    opportunity        658    00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.799    and you hope you did some good and        659    00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:15.520    that's the only reason to do a job        660    00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.159    to do some good to be able to make a        661    00:27:18.159 --> 00:27:21.200    change to make a difference        662    00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.960    but i am concerned that in general        663    00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.440    women's names are seldom mentioned for        664    00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.039    higher office        665    00:27:29.039 --> 00:27:30.960    part of that let's not kid ourselves is        666    00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.600    because they haven't had the experiences        667    00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.480    needed        668    00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.320    i mean i may know a real very        669    00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.520    intelligent woman        670    00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.240    but if she's had no political experience        671    00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.200    at all        672    00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.360    any more than a man with none at all        673    00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.880    would you say that person should be        674    00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.480    president or vice president so you get        675    00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.840    that kind of the vicious circle that        676    00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.200    keeps on going        677    00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.840    so yes although i did not see it until        678    00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.760    it was facts to me i saw the articles        679    00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.640    about 1996. and part of me        680    00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.919    is enormously pleased if you can        681    00:27:59.919 --> 00:28:03.600    understand i don't think it's about me        682    00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.320    it's about having women's names out        683    00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.159    there that would be rationally        684    00:28:08.159 --> 00:28:09.520    considered        685    00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:13.120    appropriate because of abilities and        686    00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.320    experience        687    00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.039    and i want to see that happen but i am        688    00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:18.480    trying to move        689    00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.159    into uh an apartment in 1993 and barely        690    00:28:22.159 --> 00:28:23.120    getting through that        691    00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.360    so i i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna leave        692    00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.200    it at that for now        693    00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.919    yes i guess my question is similar dress        694    00:28:29.919 --> 00:28:30.880    by the way thank you        695    00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.919    so is yours we can say        696    00:28:33.919 --> 00:28:37.200    things it's okay to say your suit let's        697    00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:44.880    take a look        698    00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.520    see with above average but not a real        699    00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.240    strong        700    00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.399    uh you know certainly no big message to        701    00:28:52.399 --> 00:28:53.600    it dean you know        702    00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.600    see with women on the faculty we'd have        703    00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.520    a much broader spectrum of        704    00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.720    fashion sense as well that's kind of        705    00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.279    frightening        706    00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.559    are these usually this jolly or we're        707    00:29:06.559 --> 00:29:08.320    supposed to be real serious if we are        708    00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.559    i'll start        709    00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:12.399    my question is similar to susan's        710    00:29:12.399 --> 00:29:13.600    because the rumors also        711    00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.120    indicate that there's a possibility of        712    00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.679    your name or perhaps another woman being        713    00:29:17.679 --> 00:29:19.279    included as a vice presidential        714    00:29:19.279 --> 00:29:20.240    candidate        715    00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.000    um could you comment on the likelihood        716    00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.919    of i mean if you don't want to comment        717    00:29:23.919 --> 00:29:25.760    on your possibility then the likelihood        718    00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.200    of a woman and the likelihood of a        719    00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.039    pro-choice candidate        720    00:29:29.039 --> 00:29:32.559    yes uh i'll be i again recognizing that        721    00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:34.799    i have no crystal ball        722    00:29:34.799 --> 00:29:37.279    um and if i did it might i might be        723    00:29:37.279 --> 00:29:41.279    cassandra-like rather than a        724    00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:43.120    and for my own party i just assume not        725    00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.919    be a cassandra        726    00:29:46.399 --> 00:29:48.080    plus she was on the losing side now that        727    00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.679    i think about it more and more this        728    00:29:49.679 --> 00:29:55.279    would be a very bad analogy um        729    00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:58.880    i suppose that it's going to be a vice        730    00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.399    president first i mean you know just        731    00:30:00.399 --> 00:30:02.720    common sense would indicate that        732    00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.720    but don't sell women so short if        733    00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.039    um and i'll talk about my former boss        734    00:30:09.039 --> 00:30:10.399    for a moment i mean he        735    00:30:10.399 --> 00:30:13.600    he uh was not in office and he ran for        736    00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.200    the president he had skills and        737    00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.480    abilities        738    00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.360    um so the idea that one would have have        739    00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.720    to somehow        740    00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.240    already the uh i think there are women i        741    00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.320    think the elizabeth doles of this world        742    00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.279    i think the        743    00:30:27.279 --> 00:30:30.080    carla hills of this world i was very        744    00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.320    disappointed just so you know        745    00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.120    with now president clinton when in the        746    00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.640    list there were no women for vice        747    00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.840    president        748    00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.760    because i thought i may not again i        749    00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.000    don't always agree with these people but        750    00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000    certainly congresswoman schroeder        751    00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.399    senator mikulski are he said dynamite        752    00:30:46.399 --> 00:30:47.919    campaigners        753    00:30:47.919 --> 00:30:49.600    and would have been an asset it seems to        754    00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.360    me a ticket        755    00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.159    having said that i think there will be        756    00:30:54.159 --> 00:30:55.440    women        757    00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.720    uh i'm an old-fashioned conservative i        758    00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.480    think government should stay out        759    00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:05.120    and i believe that is truly uh for        760    00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.279    areas that affect women's lives as i do        761    00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:09.519    for men's lives        762    00:31:09.519 --> 00:31:12.159    can a pro-choice republican woman be on        763    00:31:12.159 --> 00:31:14.000    the ticket my answer is yes        764    00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.200    will she be i don't know not if        765    00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.600    the only people that vote aren't don't        766    00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.480    agree i mean        767    00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.480    it is a democracy here i mean that's        768    00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.519    something that people        769    00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:25.840    also have a tendency to forget sort of        770    00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.399    how did you let those people win        771    00:31:28.399 --> 00:31:32.480    guess what you get to vote here        772    00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.919    democracy doesn't guarantee the best        773    00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:39.440    it doesn't guarantee your favor it just        774    00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.919    guarantees you the chance to be part of        775    00:31:41.919 --> 00:31:44.000    the picking process        776    00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.200    and so if people stay at home or if        777    00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.159    uh people with any particular point of        778    00:31:50.159 --> 00:31:50.880    view        779    00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.919    um sort of just carpet each other        780    00:31:53.919 --> 00:31:55.760    instead of getting to work        781    00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:00.080    then it won't happen but otherwise um        782    00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.480    as a republican i never understood fully        783    00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.720    i'd rather be right than be president        784    00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.519    i thought you should be able to be both        785    00:32:07.519 --> 00:32:08.880    and i still do        786    00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.919    i still do yes my name is        787    00:32:11.919 --> 00:32:14.159    it's really nice i will add this do you        788    00:32:14.159 --> 00:32:15.519    want to see a difference        789    00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:17.440    20 years ago not one woman if there had        790    00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.640    been a few in the room would have asked        791    00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.159    a question too        792    00:32:20.159 --> 00:32:22.480    that's nice the guy's been the bravest        793    00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.399    so far        794    00:32:24.399 --> 00:32:26.159    well here you go but the women are doing        795    00:32:26.159 --> 00:32:28.799    fine okay hi you speak about the closing        796    00:32:28.799 --> 00:32:31.200    gap between men and women in the in the        797    00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.320    job market and the the        798    00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.880    increasingly competitive market in fact        799    00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.919    has effectively        800    00:32:37.919 --> 00:32:40.480    shut out men and women who have not been        801    00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.159    afforded some of the opportunities that        802    00:32:42.159 --> 00:32:44.159    my classmates and i have had        803    00:32:44.159 --> 00:32:46.799    and my question to you is what specific        804    00:32:46.799 --> 00:32:48.559    advice could you give us        805    00:32:48.559 --> 00:32:51.760    as future policymakers to ensure equal        806    00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.679    access to opportunities of other        807    00:32:53.679 --> 00:32:57.840    racial and socioeconomic groups        808    00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.000    good will and merit        809    00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.640    and doing the right thing are never not        810    00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.279    going to be important        811    00:33:07.279 --> 00:33:10.720    but they aren't enough in a world        812    00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.360    especially in a free enterprise society        813    00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.120    now you have to learn to accept a few        814    00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.480    things        815    00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.799    the free enterprise society in the free        816    00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:20.000    market        817    00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.039    is not perfect businesses        818    00:33:23.039 --> 00:33:26.240    first goal is not an individual's        819    00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.640    happiness        820    00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.159    that's not their function        821    00:33:32.159 --> 00:33:35.919    so it is quite clear that to get people        822    00:33:35.919 --> 00:33:39.279    into the mix there are certain things        823    00:33:39.279 --> 00:33:40.640    that are going to have to happen        824    00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.480    or you can't say we're going to somehow        825    00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.000    make it happen because we're going to        826    00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.440    you know be these policy makers that        827    00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.080    will say        828    00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.240    oh boy we'll have everything for        829    00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.640    everybody        830    00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:54.960    one you better have a growing economy        831    00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.120    you are not going to knock every white        832    00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.720    male out of the job        833    00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.440    i mean some of them are in this room and        834    00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.600    are generally related to some of us        835    00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:07.840    and we're fond of them        836    00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:11.119    so realistically the way to have        837    00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:12.960    everyone moving together is to have        838    00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.159    more openings the hardest thing for        839    00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:18.800    women to understand still        840    00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.720    is a dependency on government is another        841    00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.320    kind of dependency        842    00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.639    and turns out in many ways to be        843    00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:25.760    self-defeating        844    00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.399    we have got to have an expanding economy        845    00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:29.040    secondly        846    00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.200    and this is where i hope you do have        847    00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:36.399    some answers my grandfather        848    00:34:36.399 --> 00:34:39.440    and i say grandfather not grandmother my        849    00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.399    grandfather        850    00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:42.639    could work at the stockyards with a        851    00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:44.079    seventh grade education        852    00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:49.280    and buy a house and a car        853    00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.320    that isn't going to happen now        854    00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.879    no matter how much you may wish it it        855    00:34:54.879 --> 00:34:55.359    isn't        856    00:34:55.359 --> 00:34:58.720    going to happen now so perhaps the        857    00:34:58.720 --> 00:34:59.280    single        858    00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.240    biggest problem facing our society as a        859    00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.440    society        860    00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.400    is not men versus women black versus        861    00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:06.800    white        862    00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.119    anglo versus hispanic because we're all        863    00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:10.880    in this one together        864    00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.400    is making sure we can move education        865    00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.760    faster more quickly into more people's        866    00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.960    lives        867    00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.320    because the young woman        868    00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.920    who is unmarried pregnant        869    00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.240    and has dropped out of high school is        870    00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:28.960    going to be poor        871    00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.280    all of her life no matter what policy        872    00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.680    you initiate        873    00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.480    the young man who believes there is no        874    00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:40.640    future and starts running at 13        875    00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.359    is not going to have a positive job        876    00:35:43.359 --> 00:35:46.320    experience by the time he's 30.        877    00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.560    so the real answer may not be in        878    00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.720    washington the goal it seems to me of        879    00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.440    everyone i've ever met at kennedy school        880    00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.040    having been there believe me the rest        881    00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.880    the country is terrific        882    00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:02.079    it may be at second and third grade        883    00:36:02.079 --> 00:36:13.839    throughout america        884    00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.920    there's a group of people committed to        885    00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.599    public service        886    00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:28.800    think back in terms of this country uh        887    00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.160    starting with jimmy carter this is        888    00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.520    actually a nonpartisan statement you'll        889    00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.400    be pleased to know        890    00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.400    sort of ran against government certainly        891    00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.920    against washington        892    00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:40.240    uh ronald reagan ran against government        893    00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.920    denigrated public service george bush        894    00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.920    did a good bit to try to turn it around        895    00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:46.960    i think and so        896    00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.599    clinton's certainly in the campaign all        897    00:36:49.599 --> 00:36:50.240    the more        898    00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.400    strongly trying to turn it around and        899    00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.839    move it further for a greater respect        900    00:36:53.839 --> 00:36:55.200    for public service        901    00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.079    where do you think it's headed        902    00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.440    the first uh one of the first        903    00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.240    dinners that they have here i can't        904    00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.119    remember        905    00:37:07.119 --> 00:37:10.160    who the person was so it isn't        906    00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.760    someone turned to me and said that there        907    00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.040    was someone from the kennedy school        908    00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.880    that was going to be going to washington        909    00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.440    to work in the clinton administration        910    00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:24.400    and i offered you know congratulations        911    00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.920    no i did i was really nice was just like        912    00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.040    eighth grade        913    00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.920    congratulations        914    00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.800    but but then the person said something        915    00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.240    that just        916    00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.560    literally did take my breath away and        917    00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.960    and that person said that guy said        918    00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.200    isn't it incredible he's going to take        919    00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.200    everything from the kennedy school and        920    00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:51.839    go to the real world of washington dc        921    00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.760    it's the only place i've ever been that        922    00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.200    described washington        923    00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.480    as the real world so        924    00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.000    the congress had some of the best        925    00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.760    hardest working nicest people        926    00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.000    but        927    00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.480    anybody under siege starts they they        928    00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.440    start the wagon        929    00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:17.119    circling members of congress        930    00:38:17.119 --> 00:38:20.560    in some ways are when i say working too        931    00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.240    hard they've made it too complex        932    00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:28.640    they're unwilling to change the process        933    00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.720    i for instance believe that one of the        934    00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.680    major problems        935    00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.079    is no rocket scientist on this one it is        936    00:38:34.079 --> 00:38:35.359    drugs        937    00:38:35.359 --> 00:38:38.960    i mean it's destroying parts of america        938    00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:43.040    our children are being lost to it        939    00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.599    there are 53 committees and        940    00:38:45.599 --> 00:38:46.960    subcommittees in the congress of the        941    00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.400    united states that work on drugs        942    00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:55.920    wouldn't you think that you would say        943    00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.920    this is such a big problem we have one        944    00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.680    committee and that's we're going to        945    00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.680    change just the way we do things we're        946    00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:02.880    working it for five years you're not        947    00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.640    going to be on any other committee        948    00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.000    every four months we're going to go to        949    00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.119    the people tell them what we thought        950    00:39:07.119 --> 00:39:09.040    tell them what we're going to do        951    00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.280    we'll listen to people but at some point        952    00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.800    we're going to say we're going to do        953    00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.079    this they don't like us they're going to        954    00:39:14.079 --> 00:39:15.359    throw us out        955    00:39:15.359 --> 00:39:18.960    i think americans would say yes        956    00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.280    yes        957    00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.560    president clinton has underestimated        958    00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.720    what americans are willing to do        959    00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:32.079    across party lines we all know        960    00:39:32.079 --> 00:39:35.440    it's gotten sloppy i don't care if        961    00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:35.680    you're        962    00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.680    i mean you know we just lost because        963    00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.520    people thought it was getting sloppy        964    00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.200    you know it isn't that i can stand up        965    00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.880    here and say and you know what i did for        966    00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.240    you        967    00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:47.920    come on change now if american people        968    00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.440    are willing to do that        969    00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:53.040    i think that the politics itself has to        970    00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:53.760    change i think        971    00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.720    ross perot whom in the beginning i        972    00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.720    resented greatly        973    00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.960    was pushing a message that should be        974    00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.560    listened to that people were willing to        975    00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.440    listen to some        976    00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.680    complex issues they're willing to have        977    00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.319    you disagree with ross perot        978    00:40:08.319 --> 00:40:12.000    they just want to be on a path to move        979    00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.599    i think it's time actually to help the        980    00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:15.200    president do that too i mean        981    00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.920    by 1996 of course i want him to lose i'm        982    00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:18.960    a republican        983    00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:22.160    not now now i want him to win        984    00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.640    for the next few years we need and ought        985    00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.640    and have to do that        986    00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.440    so the reason it's back afterwards here        987    00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.160    dean        988    00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.440    you don't have public service        989    00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:36.960    get better by just saying it's better        990    00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.480    you make sure it's doing better public        991    00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.760    service you make sure it puts the        992    00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.520    customer the people first        993    00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.760    you make sure when it's a problem you        994    00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.200    try and solve        995    00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.599    it and you don't tell the people they        996    00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:54.000    don't understand        997    00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.839    because the people are pretty sure they        998    00:40:55.839 --> 00:40:58.160    understand some things        999    00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.720    and i think it should be better i think        1000    00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.640    they respect a lot of people in public        1001    00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.160    service remember when everybody said the        1002    00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:06.160    military was a pile of junk hey        1003    00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.680    look at the persian gulf people you may        1004    00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.480    say thank you did a terrific job        1005    00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.920    same thing can be true about public        1006    00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.720    service so        1007    00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.720    i don't know that i'd ever run against        1008    00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.720    government but i don't think you should        1009    00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:19.119    run        1010    00:41:19.119 --> 00:41:22.560    for the status quo and that's what i        1011    00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.720    think america americans know        1012    00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.480    there's change out there and we have to        1013    00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.720    do it i think they're more willing than        1014    00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.200    their leaders right now to change        1015    00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:35.760    an amazing country an amazing thank you        1016    00:41:35.839 --> 00:41:38.640    can i say thank you        1017    00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.760    i

   00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.400    known        1038    00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.920    but they got here too about        1039    00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.760    a number of years ago about this time i        1040    00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.400    was in peoria illinois        1041    00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:40.079    with friends who had a down syndrome        1042    00:42:40.079 --> 00:42:41.680    daughter        1043    00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:46.160    her name was jennifer and jennifer        1044    00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.720    was four months old and had been        1045    00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:51.359    diagnosed that        1046    00:42:51.359 --> 00:42:54.319    jennifer was never going to be able to        1047    00:42:54.319 --> 00:42:57.200    accomplish was the word much        1048    00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:01.839    anyway jennifer uh mom and dad were        1049    00:43:01.839 --> 00:43:04.000    had a difficult time initially facing        1050    00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.280    this        1051    00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:06.880    they were brilliant people he'd gone to        1052    00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.560    the london school of economics she was a        1053    00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.280    teacher that a beautiful wonderful boy        1054    00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.640    jeffrey and they had        1055    00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.119    instead of the usual the pinks and blues        1056    00:43:17.119 --> 00:43:18.880    and yellows that were very typical of        1057    00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.480    the time for babies rooms        1058    00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.839    this is when they were starting to bring        1059    00:43:21.839 --> 00:43:23.680    in the strong colors that we now see        1060    00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.400    today but that was the idea was you do        1061    00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:29.119    stimulate stimulant anyway i was        1062    00:43:29.119 --> 00:43:30.960    watching jennifer in a        1063    00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:34.240    little sun porch while mom and dad got        1064    00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.400    to be out with their other child        1065    00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.319    because they hadn't had a lot of time        1066    00:43:38.319 --> 00:43:40.240    for this        1067    00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.160    and while they were out on the swing set        1068    00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.839    with jeffrey the        1069    00:43:43.839 --> 00:43:47.040    jennifer turned over        1070    00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:50.560    it was incredible and she turned over        1071    00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.400    so i just screamed jennifer        1072    00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:57.520    turned over they came running in and        1073    00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.319    said she can't        1074    00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.920    you were wrong she can't turn over the        1075    00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:04.560    doctor        1076    00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:08.960    said she can't turn over        1077    00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:14.720    and so jennifer turned over again        1078    00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:19.040    and we all cried and i thought to myself        1079    00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.880    then        1080    00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:24.079    that this beautiful baby girl who was        1081    00:44:24.079 --> 00:44:27.359    never going to come to harvard        1082    00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:32.079    had taught us all something that day        1083    00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.839    and maybe that's what graduations are        1084    00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:36.960    about        1085    00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.920    that there isn't anything ever that for        1086    00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.640    sure        1087    00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:44.800    can't be done if you can trust in the        1088    00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.119    human spirit        1089    00:44:47.119 --> 00:44:50.160    and the desire to go on        1090    00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.680    that i hope was enhanced by your time at
